i know.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
isn't it great to be in love ?
i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
who!
a journalist! peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! i know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? so a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! no, walter, i'm through.
so -- maybe i'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
same old reed.  all analysis, no action.  wasn't that the problem with you two?
we'll save them for seed. a toast!
i can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
mmmm... you smell good.
our house always needs touching up.
of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
oh, that's very - unusual.
john, it's not your problem what she eats.
laughlin. he's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
oh, stop it. what do you want me to do?
sure, but what is this?
complicated.  i couldn't stop her apologizing.
goodnight, ray.
what was she to creasy then?
"so help me god."
what if you lost your keys?
like an emergency life-raft, right?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
i haven't been briefed on any such thing!
i coulda shot you, you--
that's right!
here i'll show you.
but it's got teeth.
who?
then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... and in the end, i promise you'll beg for the axe.
i miss dad.
you asked for death. i didn't promise it -
i'm going to see a man called julian cross. ever heard of him?
i don't like beer.
hard for me? hard for me? hard for me? hard for me?  you had questions?
the laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. lancelot will come...
we do have a man for you.
mr. ola's just leaving, kay. please tell the senator i won't be a minute.
no, you're not.
yes.
i'm glad you like it.  now be quiet, i've really got to read these.
-- what?
says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
maybe i'm not understanding the question.
my last name is pherides.
hmm.  there's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. you said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
honey... i was always good.
sunday...
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do.
scobie -- he's the one that objected.
yes. although i can get a headache just like anyone.
yes.
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
than why can't you tell me.
no, my son's discovered the games room.
what... ?
anything.
he did what he was supposed to.
this better not be some freddy joke.
well, we...
what are you, a boy scout?
ask your girlfriend.
he always had a weakness in that area. i saw it the first time i met him. we all had our weaknesses, i guess. daitz wanted the money. with dave it was the glory. koessler saw the behavioral sciences unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. he had his eye on the director's job, even then. catching killers was a means to an end for them.
fine, thanks.
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns. and i must wear it bravely.
pull your hammer back, smokey's coming at you.
well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
buff...
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
doesn't mean shit. when christine was a hostess at sushi roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. think it worked? fuck no. how do you think i met her?
goddamnit, i'm talkin' to the man. you set right there, karl.
give me a fucking.....
it does.
yup. that's me.
oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
gabriel, let him go --
you understand what you'll be doing?
replacement party.
would that i could.
the thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
oh, so you feel that way too . motions to other room. stay in there--i'll call you when needed.
nothing.
no i ain't.
we've had a real hard life, too, mama.
what is this place, merlin?
well, i've been accused of many things, mrs. mulwray, but never that.
you find out?
let go!
and clean.
well, uh...promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
doing what?
jesus.  i do not know.  i'll talk to you later.
no, i tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
at least let me give you this back. i washed it.
two.
the whole joint is half the size of rhode island.
and what was that?
you remember alison?
it's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
s'only got to hold for another few days.
look -- i just got this from phil fogarty.  it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. it proves i was right, all along.
here's my favorite.
tell her about <u>what</u>?
jimmy?
did you try to kill...
fine. what do i do?
not quite.
i told you, you know, i thought i was doing the right thing, you know, i think she's innocent.
take a pill, kid. i just meant stay cool.
what's up...?
forgive me, i've called you out and you should have been resting.
can i come in?
my poor baby!
i have played a few times. here and there. as a matter of fact, i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue.
i suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
how about --
breakfast brunch -- ?
don't you get it?!  you see the hat? i am mrs. nesbit!! 
sure.
good. how's your mom?
dropped two big ones. real fighter. you're in the insurance line, harry?
every night, penelope, for the past two years, i've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
i'm not leaving you. i took self defense
of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, mr. white?
you lost the charge?
you think you can do this, don't you?
upper management thinks you're dull.
no? not even one more?
you can't, your orders are specific...
you're kidding.  can't you shoot him or something?
okay.
and if we don't invite maranzano, we can't invite masseria. guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
no...
do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"dear senator smith, i would like to come to your boy's camp and i shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." oh, isn't that wonderful. look and he signs it. "yours truly, stinky moore." isn't that marvelous?  say--have i got some paper here?
it's mine...
clark, you want me to come in after you?!
shouldn't i be in a hospital?
i'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  spend a week.  i'll change the locks, the phone lines, i'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
he bows, goes. door shuts behind him.
virgil, please.  don't do this to me.
john doe.
let's sit down. they walk to the table. lois calls out to the balcony.
there's a dead body in the exhibit! people are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
do you know how much a cow costs, comrade iranoff?
you, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
sure will, pal, sure will.
it doesn't matter!  just get out of the goddamn building...
what evidence?
i bet your parents were happy to pay.
uh huh. yeah. forget it.
no... a job... i didn't know what. he set up an appointment for me to see a man.
yes.
the president would support a reasonable request for an increase.
totally.
thanks.  i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
no. is detective gordon going to be at your house?
only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. they can sense it miles away. if he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  it's a good time, too. they're night feeders...
oh, my sweet, beautiful lotte.
that's little egotistical.
are yuh?
the police always do, don't they?
sad?
i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?
i don't know how to make goulash.
yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
i'm sorry, lee.  why did she leave you?
he knows something's up.
he was not family. family is all that matters. do you think if you or i were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
in the hospital. i was kind of excited about it at the time, but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers.
it's public record.  if the public cares enough to read it.
i'm sorry!  i said something wrong, didn't i!  please forgive me!
ethan, if you knew about jim?..why..
not so loud.
well, we must be who we must be...
couple months before i was born--
just cool down, son.  i ain't accusing you of anything.  serves toby right to get his ass whooped. if you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
i'm leaving, man.  i'm bailing town. this place has gotten way too hairy.
can you remember anything at all?
it's got caffeine in it. that's all i know.
brown's dead, we don't know about blue.
i really should get back. there's... there's something i'm supposed to do.
h'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
this is kronos one. i am chancellor gorkon.
would you please get your hands off my face, tallulah?  what happened to the newspaper?
uhura, you did what was necessary.  keep trying. you'll find him...
we used to sing it in school.  don't look at me with such horror. they had schools in those days.
certainly.  anything i can do to be of service.
yes, sir.
she loved me.  she wanted to see me every night.
where are we going?
groom.
aye.  he's a good lad.  that's why i ask you, macfarlane.
in point of fact, it didn't.  but i'm convinced the theory is sound.
scene 32. int. candy's living room - night. "what are you talking about ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
jeffrey told her last night.
no...i just... i'm so fucked up here alan, i don't know...there's so much...so many things --
why? what are you going to do?
a bill! not *him*!
what do you mean?  you said you wanted to see me.
do you think they bought it?
don't go telling anyone.  it'll ruin my reputation.
and he's right over there by the way.  what did you do to your face?
what happened to you, nick?  i mean, look at yourself...
you're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
mrs. robinson, you didn't -- i mean you didn't expect --
holds four.
get oack on their tail.
my fault - what do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "cnc" --course not completed, no explanation required. theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
and instead,  i came -- bringing you nothing.
no, 1995 is the past.
chaos.
yes.
honey.
why didn't you come sooner? it's been over two weeks.
about what?
so whatta you want a badge?  it's your first major league game sal. one thing i learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  you'll never be sorry.
so who's asking? i don't want to marry you.
that ain't gonna work.
i'm supposed to be running.
i'd rather be his whore than your wife.
your warehouse?  go on ahead--to your "warehouse." i'll be okay...
take it easy. lay down and don't think about it.
freeze!!
the flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
he was a con man, wasn't he?
llewelyn moss?
north.
carl smith.
okay, but...why?  no offense.
i'm not innocent. but i'm afraid. she feels she's in danger from the others.
this is swell.  where's michael? i've got things to get straight with him and i can't wait on line.
okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
thanks.
i told bianchinni i would take a look.  is it that sink?
who the hell is this "they?"
i mean it.  from what i can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
get knotted.
you have our cards.
and the grass?
what?
my baby.
don't be silly...i'm old.  don't look at me like that, please.  why'd you come back?
we're running out of smoke.
it doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
she could be out.  she could be sick in bed for all we know.
you're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
go and get yourself washed up, mr. bernstein.  there doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
yes. she's disappeared, hasn't she?
are you my friend?
so are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
no kidding. no kidding!
... is over.
dinner at the river cafe. au bar afterwards, maybe.
i want him!
do you really want me to?
will?  you could come up here.
i'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols.
you're a liar.
sonny, come on out!
activated.  vertical drop checked. correcting course.  on tangential course now, orbiting.  crossing the terminator.  entering night side.
pete, i'm so sorry about what they did to you.  i didn't think you'd come back, i thought you'd want to write again...
in the building ...  mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the patrolman.
what's the matter? are you afraid to try?
okay, kent, call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home. favoring clark -- happy now, he turns to leave the office. shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
[maybe your men stole from you.]
what do you want, a joke?
i'm an honorable clown?
in this drawer....
yeah, hi, i have a one o'clock with dr. mierzwiak. clementine kruczynski.
and what'd she want?
the sushi?  i did the wine. didn't you do the sushi?
roy, you're a short-con operator. and a good one, i think. don't talk to me like i'm another square.
you should've done what i did. a clean break.
yeah ...
it's okay.
no, look, this is not about sooze, alright. wait, wait, wait, wait. she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony?
thanks!
didn't call, them pantyhose, though. what was it, evelyn?
well i know how it went with cecile. she won't shut up about it. how'd it go with mrs. jesus?
not this time.
sure.  no place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... they tell you all about that in those books?
it crashed, didn't it?
yeah.
magic johnson.
--the lookout in the motor inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
it didn't discourage you, though.
aw, i got a brother down in k.c., runs a freight outlet.  i can go halfsies with 'em!  it ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
i don't want them left back.
i'm not sure how to take that.
[who ordered it?]
what?
oh my god, sorry.  i'm interrupting.
with a wildly beating heart.
and a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
so who changes?
we can't go anywhere until i get to a phone.
sure. thanks a lot about my mother. we'll work out some arrangement, because naturally i want to pay...
we're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!
look i know what i'm doing. i have experience and training in space walking.
i can do that.
no one knows you're here?
without what, his smearing yours first?  what's he got on you, loew?  pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
tax-free booze. it's about all you can say for army life.
how can you do that? you don't live anywhere near that school.
no kidding.
unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
what thing?
why not make them happy?
layton! oh shit!
no!
please don't tell me "you'll find somebody else someday." cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  oh, i'll get by, don't worry about me.
yes it does.  don't you see?  we have to play by the rules.  that's what it wants.
got here as soon as i could.
how bad?
we'll find it. just calm down.
alright i'm here. what the fuck do you want from me?
then why?
so, there are rules.  things you do and things you don't do.
i'll just be a second.  so what happened tonight at the office?
looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? the only time they ever picked me up, mckinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
i'm a little late, that's all.
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois.
... see, that's what i thought at first.  how can you like someone that perfect? no potential for long-range livability.
our work?
i thought i was.  i was confused.
kent, kent for chrissakes.  you must be eleanor.
no, i believed her. she was in pretty bad shape. inside and out. but the boys were never formally charged.
what.
what are what?
resting, he's had a long day. aramis --
i know. been there myself. we've all been there, haven't we, miss packard?
i'll look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves.
yeah.  have a pleasant vacation?
you what?
no, we just ate. i only remember how tough my father was. now i know he had to be like that, to make us tough. this city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
see that trap door up there? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. it was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
he also said we'd avoid that storm in space. and we know how that turned out.
walter, i'd like you to try something for me.
that's right, mister.  you better be afraid.  i told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  now i find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
sal!... fourteen street.
i'm going to open it!
i love you.
i don't know. but someone must want it pretty badly.
that's great.
breathtaking.
... sir?
all right if i look around your lobby?
listen, darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as i get where i'm going i swear i'll--
a charming term.  now, <u>why him</u>?
it's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny.
my holds are bursting with swag. that bit of shine matters to me ... why?
you were lying.
you want me to stop the car?
i'm not just bringing anybody -- i'm bringing miss kubelik.
you okay?
now, now. he's a good boy.
no, thanks. the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out.
please don't go.
don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
you ready for this? i've recently discovered that our good friend mrs. caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette urging her to stay away from me.
i got it.  but you can tell her yourself.  just watch your ass and you'll make it.
he didn't have to tell...
try again, c'mon, try again.
i know you've been trying to kill me.
you look great.
yes... a very slim one. i want to be fair. i don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
would four of them -- ?
but he asks the impossible. i need more men.
send oona up above the tree tops. she be our eyes.
give me some of the good stuff.
lady, try making some sense.
my scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
i know that i've been... unwell.  i know it's been like there's two sides to me.
just a little bit. she died when i was very young.
no!
not word one.
look joyce, i need your key to the files, not advice, okay? this is a complex case.
she is here.
not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  you, of course, remember miss torso.
it tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. it covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - bob dylan, bruce springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. i don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
so where are we going, princess?
no; he was probably just resting his eyes.
the spot we picked to spend the winter. maybe we ought to look a little harder.
i scanned it at arecibo; negative results, always.
excuse me?
what do you think he saw?
i'll drink to that.
no, you gimme your gun, boy!
what about the rest of my comic books?
no.  no, i don't.
excuse me?
go home!  show them how rich you are for a change!
carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
that's all right with me. always liked kids.
no! now we're inverted!
a polish pilot. it's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
... i'm listening.
no, i'd like the scarf.
i see.  i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
but this is a bad one.
oh shit! no! andy, don't let them take me back there!
then it's time to change that --
who?
i'd like to commission a work.  i'm a great admirer of yours.
i never met the woman. i'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
maybe, yes... maybe no.
no!
i've got enough on my mind without that.
the lockdown thing.
fine, but i'm not gonna be no bulldog omega 5.
to hell with you!
i thought as much.
well, i don't.
sure is.  so why call me?
sure dad.
nonsense, i'm your mother now and i want you to eat.
you know, you have to. sometimes you just have to, toby.
you startled me.
you scots have a way with game.  it still has life in it. spirit.  back home the food is so...domestic.
you don't have to burst in here every time, jerry.  just call and make an appointment.
no, as a matter of fact you didn't. what about the girl, zuzu petals, how does she fit in?  i mean, she is what this case is about.
no sweat. only do me a favor?
he's being weird, i'm sorry. i have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
your self-restraint puzzles me, admiral. you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
i don't blame people for their mistakes, but i do ask that they pay for them.
i'm not stitching nikes in panama! ... bedwetter!
class schedule, map, book list.
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
how can you be with charley and johnny friendly and still be with me? either way it's a lie. it's like there were two different people inside of you. you've got to be one or the other.
decaffeinated too?
get out!
exactly. happy birthday.
well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  i'd better get a cab.
what? i'm just kidding around with the customers... it's my shtick!
i figured it out.
there you are.  naomi, it's just... i'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
i wouldn't think of leaving, hans. unless you want to open the front door...?
huh?
go on back to the hotel.
we don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
who'd you go with?  that's not good.
george it's not your concern. don't worry about it. just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
hurry up, would you?
that's what i said.  is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
easy. mr. jenkins. what job did mr. jenkins have?
well, i'm only an employee, i ain't married to him.
a feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
let it go.
no... i don't think so, man.
you know who it is.  it's mitch. and murray.  'cause it doesn't have to be this way.
you have another choice.
then i'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  go on, now.
what is it, a surprise?
oh! yes! here!
i shouldn't say that, because i'm your teacher.
not at all.
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
jane, i have to talk to you.
yeah.  how much?
overruled...
don't worry -
where's this coming from?
you have been hearing the sordid side then.
whatever you do, just...don't stop.
i'm gonna go look at it again.
yeah.
i'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, i'm, to tell you the truth, mr. dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
it sounds wild.  so now you're a big hero, right?  for fixing their system.
we want to see you.
where?... the new york times. the first one was -- "he handles produce well." which we already knew!  the point is, you have a lot of the signs.
i'm sorry. i really shouldn't have --
i've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late.
well, i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college.  i know that i've been branded a communist, which i'm not, but even if i was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a bill of rights for?
two hundred meters.
yeah, you will.  of course.
oh alain!  c'est merveilleux!  tu me gâtes.  je t'aime.  attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
i don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but i don't want y'all to come here no more.
how, dick?  the way <u>you</u> earned it?  by marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  what is this knute rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  you were a goddamn dumpling.  maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  till you <u>were</u> nothing.  i saved your ass.  so you'll pardon me if i don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  okay, dick?  i can't do it.
if i can smoke it.
i don't know, mom; i've never met bobby.
ben, the money's not important.  we could <u>save lives</u>.
no.  i think they isolated him in genetic engineering. homo aquaticus...
it's not bullshit.
don't even tell me you're hot for miss titty pom poms over there.
sure.
no, i've been excited before.
no.
yes, it is.
it's a crime.
i want to know who you are.
forget it.  the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
i'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
confess, and you may receive a quick death. deny, and you must be purified by pain. do you confess? ...do you confess?!
ya always in a bad mood --
and i'll just shitkick in my usual way.
the human?
no. i never date outside my race.
] so <u>that's</u> one of the pearls from                            ] your mysterious journal?  and all this                      ] time i thought you were restructuring                       ] the world's economy.                                        ]
what?
good night.
that's enough...go on inside and help lucy set the table...you, too, deborah!
it's not that late in seattle.
oh yeah, sunday night. you guys been out tasting today?
well, i ... good point. what do you suggest?
promise?
report status!
no, you're not. where are you? where are you?
i'm not sure i can face it.
you can come and live again in the big house if you want. now that i'm alone, i can settle down anywhere.
i think we're falling in love.
this is a totally barbaric custom.
alright, father, here it is. about two weeks ago i went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath.
you're the tom hardy i've been reading about in the papers, right? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres.
listen to what?
that's typical of your daughter. takes those things for granted.  why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami—  for the love of it?
isn't it funny?  you can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life. you can look at me.  which shows  a strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   but you <u>shy</u> when i say the name of god.
rorschach, that was a long time ago.  i mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
i'll take some.
who were you talking to?
you are a criminal.
hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  and everyone, including your family, will find peace. will i just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
she's a child.  she might panic. she doesn't know me.  she might not come to me.  she might just run.
maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. no thanks to you.... what you think of the hair?
'musta knocked her up.
don't you see? jason was _asleep_. and he was dreaming -- the rem patterns prove that. and i saw finger blades just like krueger's come out of jason's chest. there has to be a connection.
she's mine!
we do not take tips.  i'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
well, no...but...
we're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, johnny?  that wouldn't be... shocking enough.  wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
well, they will be.
yeah, uh, just a minute
have a good night.
suit yourself...i'm easy.  better watch out for the wockers.
bismark...
yeah, well, i'm getting what i refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor i've got is giving me strange readings.  i mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
hey, take it easy. i'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
he rents it for the summer.  bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  most a these guys can't keep a job.  when the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
thanks, franky.
no, father. from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me. whenever they say mozart with love, they'll have to say salieri with loathing. and that's my immortality - at last! our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. at least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful god!
no smart-ass remarks or nothing.
i think so.
a bullet to the right cerebellum.
like heroin?
i'm so happy you're happy.
it doesn't make any sense.  he wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
what?
yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
christoph had spinal cancer.  his body kept rejecting gene therapy. he was desperate.  it was him, it wasn't us --
help me in!
could you bring it up?
well, you wanna use the shower?
i'll say whatever i want --
why?
no. open her ...
don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
i think it's called "a shower". you might try it sometime.
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  i've got a ghastly headache, actually.
you said, "will it change..." wife. will it change...
there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home. last time i saw halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, i saw mister - sitting on a tub. he loved that tub. like king on a throne. he was a hateful thing. bloody and evil..but he was better than me.  mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named mister. but wasn't no way i'd ever be paul d. again..schoolteacher changed me. was never no beating under mr. garner. schoolteacher changed that. why wouldn't a man run from that? why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? and it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
move it!
that's where we come from first?
they won't figure it out.
oh god.
i should kill you... if it's true you should die... i should kill you now!
look, the other night, i want to apologize.
i've changed my mind. i'll come to moscow. if you -- are still going --
these are ich luge bullets. my grandfather snared a shitload of them in w.w. two. they're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
for what?
why not?
oh, i dunno. watching tv.
we'll leave first thing in the morning.
new york.
jim, i've got to go.  i'm already late--
but how?
was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
i'm nothing but a body with a voice. no mind.
i'll do it.
very impressive.
no.
well, i just wanted you to know how i felt. hell, i know air command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  and don't think i don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of negro descent.
this is friday, her riding lesson is on tuesdays.  i got it right here...
no.
no, you don't! get this clear: socking people is no solution for anything.
if it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. but this is a formerly prominent citizen.
uh, right.  a... news story.
krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
i don't know.
okay, ma. don't you worry.
you bet we is!
i'm sure it's lovely.
i worked passage from england as a cabin boy.  after my mother passed, i came out here ... looking for my father.
frankly, yes, to my surprise.  he thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
--you should get back into bed.
well, i practice a lot...
may i ask why?
whereas you are.
what's going to happen?
hey. you wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you don't mind me comin' over.
well... it started with the play before this one...
no, it's okay. i just can't believe i left it out in the open like that. crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? poking around?
five million?
leavenworth a tough joint?
i'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
we're liable to win if we keep this up. for somebody like you, you sure run fast.
you've not aged a day since then?
he knew what he was doing.  nobody forced him to rob banks.
scandalous! what would your dear mother say?
may be please have the wallet.
tomorrow?
yes.
i'm goin' check on this address in the bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
and some really fast cars.
there's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
i need you to find my little sister. she goes by the name zuzu...
of course it is howard. that's why they call it a marathon.
because i thought it proper, major.  why else would you think i'd do it?
yes. where is he?
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
talk to them!  heavens!
yes.  but do you know?
i'm going to california with my brother.
i think you're kidding yourself, clara. i used to think about moving out, you know? and that's what i used to say. "my mother needs me." but when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. actually, you need your father. you know what i mean? you're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
it's fine.  i can bleep it out.
thank you.  maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
eh?
about six and a half million dollars.
me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass.
i want a consensus, bobby. consensus. either air strike or blockade. something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. i need it by saturday. make it happen.
i'm looking for...paul owen's...place.
i don't mind.
sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
i went to the movies.
that is for me to decide.  i need to talk to her mr. riley, she is a key element in this case.  i have a press conference in an hour, and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
so did dan.
and mine is wearing thin, young man! we supported you because you promised action. and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with picard while--
i can paint anywhere.
are you neglecting my request?
marvin, i need you to hold on. there's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
land sakes, i don't mind. i never did hold much with job, even if he is scripture. he took on too much to suit me. i don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from massachusetts. yes, mary, you go ahead and read.
i'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. we were just... i was just experimenting.
that's what makes you interesting.  as a teacher.
i've known susan for more than fifteen years.  james, we're old allies.
i like you. that's the thing about my psychic thing. i think that's my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you're a really good guy.
...who?
gee, this is a surprise, mr. gittes.
yeah -- na trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. just stay out of my way till this is done, captain.
i'll go.  we'll both go.  far away.
did i kill him? of course not!
what?
margo, as you know, i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith. i have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. you were one. jeanne eagels another... paula wessely... hayes - there are others, three or four. eve harrington will be among them...
are you planning to be the exception?
you had your chance, james. now i’m looking for a bigger thrill.
come on, linda. it's just sex.
now that is ridiculous, dude.  no one is going to cut your dick off.
heil, baby!  i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
no.
you don't have to be embarrassed.
i'm afraid you don't know the half of it. sit down.  i have a tale to tell.  and not a happy one.
he what?
they go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  then, they start coming back to us.
what has the world come to? this is horrible. we're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy. by the time i got my discharge, though, she was divorced. her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
so she picks the women, we pick the programs.  seals?
a little.
oh, but it will end well for love?
rick?
he was tough. you did all you could.
maybe! is it impossible?
and where do we think we're going?
oh yeah right, like i'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus.
i asked if we could give him anything else.
no!!  it's a wonder you couldn't get me something i can eat.
that very nice.
well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. i traced the hacker's call. the secret service picked him up this morning. i'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then i can eliminate it.
i...i...
i think you're a dangerous man, mr. dowd.
anthony, red, stay with the guns!  coma, you cover the cannons!  joe, theo, come with us!  earl, you get on the radio! we're gonna fight these fuckers.
yes.
the what.  i've kind of run away from home, you see.  it has nothing to do with my parents or money. i saw something i wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that i keep myself out of sight.
all right. what's the scoop?
what bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, mr. doe. there were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
don't you keep up with the news?  we're doing alien artifacts now.
there was this monster.  he was after me.  he wanted to kill me.
yeah!
don't touch me! i'm not doing it for you!
of course i know -- who do you think is paying for it?  the emperor himself, didn't you know?  why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front?  burning patriotism? filial love?  he wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play emperor.  watch out for him, narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
yes.
that's what i thought.
i've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
i'm seeing something that was always hidden. i'm involved in a mystery. i'm learning. and it's all secret.
we don't tell anyone that. which is why you can talk to us. and if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. that's another reason you can relax.
where's your dad?
you think people hate you.
-- no no, your turn. tell me a story.
oh, geez, i'm full of shit. i already told you that.  anyway. see ya.
you know the regulations well, major.
if my plan works, gentlemen, i'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
we'll see...
anita!
ethan - iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  it can kill you.
mary said you might be coming.
how is he?
you might want to pass it along to mac.
all right. that's what i want. poolroom with a little handbook on the side. getting old.
yeah. i sure know that. yeah, but how many more are out there?
of course --
yes?
demons? i don't know what to tell you. it sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. the problem, jacob, is that you have no context for it. you're a renegade existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after freud. how the hell am i supposed to make it fit?
look, carla.  this is a hard time for you.  many young people go to hollywood. i did...and we all dream of it, and here, here hollywood has come to you...
oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
stop that.
you'd better talk, schulz, because i'm going to find out with you or without you. because i won't let go for a second. because they'll have to kill me to stop me. so talk!
in the room. were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? i'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, i will.
you don't. it's random, there no trick.
congratulations.  then i am free to search for the mainland.
oh, stewardess. my husband is very sick. can you do something, please?
then fuckin' find it.  i'm going for the girl.
the premium leads.  yes.  i know what they cost.  john.  because i, i generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  nineteen senny-nine, you know what i made? senny-nine?  ninety-six thousand dollars.  john?  for murray... for mitch...look at the sheets...
why you think that was?
my first name's--clarissa.
where are we going?
excuse me for asking.
thank you.
tom. tom! tell me, what's going on?
why do you want me to go back to my parents? they hate me. why do you think i split? there ain't nothin there.
right. if i win, you wear a dress on our date.
but general -- this tunnel is your baby!  you're sure you can't stay ?
me, too.
i'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
i'm sorry, i don't think so.
yes.
i don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
sure.
hi.
gee, why, mom? he's my best friend... and he's awful good in arithmetic. he even helps professor barnhardt.
i don't want names!  just lead me to him.  where's their nest?
forever together.
two double whiskeys. was wunschen sie?
what?
what a gasser.
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but i'm going to tell you the truth. there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  that's where we come in.
whatever it is you're upset about.
that i really don't know.
i never hurt nobody...
you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i'll let you know immediately. good luck.
but you knew about this.
go where?  where're you going?
beth shalom? it's reform.
you know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
all right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
what's botherin' you, anyway?
go home, mulder. it's late.
that's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. i won plenty of races with 'em.  listen, you want to see them? come up on the roof with me and i'll show 'em to you.
-- killing is what you know.  pack some food while i prep for the flight.  i'm sure not gonna let him go.
with time...you get used to it. besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... then you're happy too.  so i've been wasting my breath? you pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  get out of here! i don't want to lay eyes on you again! this is the last straw! your mother's right, you're crazy!!  but how'd he do it? the little bastard! by watching, he's learned! it's incredible!  i'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! there are no more tickets for you! and i'm also talking to father adelfio! you won't be an altar boy any more either!!! you little runt! 
uh, hey buddy. oh boy, am i pissed. you're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but i just got beeped for emergency surgery. well, um, sorry, but i'm going to have to bail on you.
who?
tell me about your adopted mother
i thought it was inspired.
fire the rockets!
huh?  no!  what the fuck are you talking--i'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
overruled.
what would you say that was supposed to mean?
it's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
its'...ah...about my daughter....
it wasn't a school like yours and there was no sister anna.
every morning.
no. people never run away from anything.  the rain didn't last very long.  you know what i think? i think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. we scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
check ncic, maybe he's got a record.  then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
yeah, where is the spider?
where i saw you.  everything going okay now?  you live around here?
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
that's why the little people sent you. just <u>like</u> magic.
ready.
do you think he was telling the truth?
christ, stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
love ya, margie.
guinan? i don't know what you're talking about.
just a minute –– just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante building and loan, i'll never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . why, in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why . . . here, you're all businessmen here. doesn't it make them better citizens? doesn't it make them better customers? you . . . you said . . . what'd you say just a minute ago? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
me arm hurts.
i'm not a nai-ive little...
look, even if by some miracle michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  give the troopers a chance to search.
ben, are you there?
heard you come here now and again. figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
umm, ummmmm
you know ...  what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
then what was good about it?
which part? that or the day-to-day.
thank you.
howls.
you want the rifle or the smith?
elizabeth! little elizabeth! why you're so... middle aged!
did it ever bother you?
you want me to take you home, i'll take you home.
i was here!
and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin.
founders of zion. builders of freeside.
sally--!
it was better than this... look, you, i'm very intelligent. if you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. if you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. i'm drowning and you're describing water.
you're going too?
you gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
sure.
i think so, too.
go commander.
what's going on down there?
i would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to cary grant.
listen, i got a crazy favor to ask.
really?
you're pretty quick with those numbers. how about the odds of me buying the first round?
no. please enlighten me.
your name sport?
i have to be somewhere.
aw, cut it out, will you? you'll get me thinking about charlie again.
whether crabs are in season there now...
we got em.  north...no, henry james was the novelist, frank james was a criminal...  yep, you came to the right place.  jessie james was the <u>brother</u>.  of the novelist, that's right.  that's alright susie.  see you tomorrow, susie.

i'm glad it's okay.
this ain't the time, richard.

it's you ... it's you ...
course it's pete! look at 'im!
no, i need the original note.

thermostat's gone. and then some.
i just gave-- yeah, sure.
he felt sorry for me.  it was so nice to flirt.  he was a darling man.
you want to rent a movie.
well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
i did.  i did, reed...but i wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. elt was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
there's nothing further to be gained from this...
i think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
the same thing that could happen to any of us.
you're goin' out to las vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. what the fuck? i mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.

eddie, where are we?  we passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
there's only one worth noticing.
you're welcome.
captain, i do not believe there <u>is</u> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
no, that's not it--i just want to be sure i understand you.
where's hal, what's going on?
we're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
the thing is, joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be joel with the same fucking problems.
in that case --
ok.
look, i'd really like to...
lately kiss my ass lately.  that isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to murray.  talk to mitch. when we were on peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  you talk to him.  the seville...?  he came in, "you bought that for me shelly." out of what?  cold calling.  nothing. sixty-five, when we were there, with glen ross farms?  you call 'em downtown.  what was that?  luck? that was "luck"?  bullshit, john. you're burning my ass, i can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  my stats for those years? bullshit...over that period of time...?  bullshit.  it wasn't luck. it was skill.  you want to throw that away, john...?  you want to throw that away?
sure.
i didn't do anything.  it just happened.
nope.
come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
where did this come from?
the cops could trace this call back to you.
yeah, yeah. that's what i'm thinking --
yes.
right.
sure, i'll take her up to eight hundred.
you think i didn't get that?
it's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  really. it's not.  he won't came back.
they sell some of everything. come on let's go. i won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
understood!
we're gonna have to step in, sam. those cia boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. let me take care of it.
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
...tight.
you1re leaving, too?
your conversation has one marvelous advantage, swana. however many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
yes, mr. gittes.
you are not having your baby in london. you're going to have your baby at cedars in beverly hills, america, delivered by dr. milton cohen.  period. and you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that lamase bullshit.  there's no excuse for pain like that.
no thanks - 
senator jonathan kendall, of ohio.
i'll wait for your call.
how 'bout you?
just don't fall asleep.  sooner or later something's gonna happen.
she did not do it... please listen...
j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.
don't go reading my lips, man. that's an intrusion. save that shit for the sniper school. comprende?
good looking?
who?
son.  little excitement out at the reservation this morning. wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun. bia handled it. i went by for backup.
i think so.
aw, shut up.  you had me at hello. _ 130.
... i bet you're gay.
but, paulie, please.
i guess he's still on the road. what kind of show is this?  are they some negroes in it without being buffoons?
when we get this group down, i'm gone.
'it's booty time, it's booty time, across the u.s.a.  it's booty time...'
...one moment, mr. concannon...
what i...
i have a confession to make.  someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
oh, hi.  i'm fine, sara.  my god, a voice from the past!
no.
hello?  last birthday was?
will you get the fuck out of here.
very true!
oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. it's free.
one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. name's carl taylor. long record of arson, assault, the works. the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia... still waiting for interpol.
ted, get a grip on yourself.  you should never have left the hospital.
i'm not playing any more golf.
figure she's with him?
have you been in?
south african women are very sporty.
without question?  he only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  what curve are you marking on, doctor?
you'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
did phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
what did albania ever do to us?
i've a very pessimistic view of life. you should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. i-i-i feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
same as we -- they pray.
that's not where i am.  miller no? where are you?
say it. scream it. all the way out the front door and into your van. and if you stop screaming, i swear to god i'll blow your head off.
well, that's why they paid so well.
if you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
i say we keep sittin' on boca.
let me think about that.
oh.
someone's got that job.  agent orange! i came up with that one. anyway, there are endless color possibilities and i'd be great at it.
my dad's in the other room.
and who is that?
why?
only were he a fool to boot.  see yon viper?
you want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- i'll have a stroke.  i've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
because going down it's a big deal! i used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later i'd go down on him. but i only had sex with the guys i loved.
so what?
i'm fine! i'm fine!
when we were up poking around his place... i found this...
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
that's fine.
at least insofar as we have our first casualty.  me.
kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
it never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
i got pretty close.
no. you got the wrong idea.
i'm sorry to hear that.
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting sire. -- the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. paul can see...
i don't know -- how would i know?
you can?
do you expect me to believe that?
what?
hey!  stop it!  i can't see.
we must speak again, mr. gardiner, many times!
i want the girl.  unharmed.  now.
excuse me...!
what job?
that's they're business.  can i drop you somewhere?
what?
you know everything, don't you?
touchy, touchy. i'm sorry i brought the wedding up. let's just avoid the issue, alright? now, are we having coffee?
then that's what i meant.  fired. canned.  out on my fanny.  the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police.  just like that.
no, you won't.
what time is it?
it's spelled different, but basically... now you said it twice; just one more time, and i'll be free.  and then <u>you'll</u> be free.
i've filed a report with father frank.
i don't know what he was, but he made frankenstein look like a lily!
i have never been on this island!
the nazi's killing his kid. he could've jumped the guy. he could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... what would you have done if they were killing your son?
we've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
does she know where she's going?
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
anything new?
a few cops.
speak.
i see -- it's just the erlanger claim then.
you see, i have this thing about saxophone players.
no he wouldn't, i can't go home.
all right.  after they put you away...
"don?"
when can you leave?
oh?
something that brings warmth to my heart.  duckbill platypus.
you have a hollandaise sauce ?
come over to my house whenever you want. i'll tell my mom.
make me an offer.
dead, dead, dead.
they're holding position.
i'll get there as soon as i can.
it was my first one of these.  we were a secondary unit, and i was pretty shaky going in.  i was still considered a rookie.
billy ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
i don't like him being here.
i mean new york's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'hey, ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
adam!  she's got bitch written all over her!  you do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
it's our time, brother.
no, dad.  i have thoughts of my own once in a while.
no. you took them out.						  *
tommy, you are the falcon, winged lord of the sky.
harry york. i work for martoni kaminski, he's running for congress here.
the postal service. i'm a mailman.
just a little something' somethin'.
what do you mean?
then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
look, i appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, i can take care of myself.
juba was a numidian.
i called my dad.
i don't know... let me sleep on it and figure it out.  because i'm stuck! can't go back to what i had... she's evicted me from my life.
i never said i wasn't upset.  of course i'm upset.  i miss her terribly.  but i know what i saw and what i heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
i don't know what i've done.
i don't know...
and you're gonna solve the mystery?
what was it?
well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
what?
who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
and, <u>with</u> disrespect, constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
it could mean that, yes.
there's one to every rule.
is there any other planet where this species exists?
let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
i want to run down the street. i want to buy a toy. eat from the shops.
take a look at this.
we did what we had to do.
i shouldn't have come.
i'm sorry about your arm.  kabuo and i.  are very sor...
oh my g-d.  we were having lunch here. he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him.  i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
i told you, man, super bowl sunday.
but why would andy want me?
nanotechnology.
shut the hell up.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. you haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
how?
you're welcome, grace.
nah, see, maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. he, you know, he tied in with the club. set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
yeah.  so you can call me if you need help.
you don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! please, come with me, i'll show you!
fat little baby, crying for mommy.
let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
it's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  she's never been less popular.
i knew you were going to say that. i don't buy it, and i don't see a case.
we'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the committee needn't find out.
who the hell is lucy delaney?
like it.  almost there.
jody, no...
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
okay.  okay.  but this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
a comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, canada, some florida and caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
right, sure, but what's the problem? are they keeping you a prisoner here? do they drug you?  did reverend mother like, kidnap your parents?  we can call the enquirer.
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, i made a command decision that changed my life.
not particularly.
he's damn good.
what you said to me in the room.
sit down, my son.  you may not know it, but i've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
yeah, and what might that be?
it's miller time.  let me go give these koreans s'more business.
they found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
let's try down here...
maybe later.
what do i do?  how do i spin this?
we all do.
a matter of hours now.
am i home?
you look awful, like you haven't slept in days. and so old.
the one i'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
how many bodies did you find?
oh, yeah. hey, little fellow –– you worry me. you got someplace to sleep?
there's the agency issue. i think koessler may suspect something already. we're not on the best footing with him as it is.
driving mr. lenny.
and i am his.
i've been looking for you because i want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
don't.
i'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
i likes yellow.
do you know you were humming?
one is gluttony.
we ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. we cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  but a mighty sweet little drop, eh, charley?
precinct six. i sent a friend over with bail money.
thanks, jack.
oh, jesus... how?
bastard!  isn't it great, tom? i found it in naples. i bargained for about two weeks.
he is in love. his anger is gone.
his son is worse than he was. he's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
he's working a double shift.
goldilocks and the three bears?
that you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
i'd vote for outer space.  no way those are local boys.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
you're goddamn right.  and it's got nothing to do with the b-2 bomber. 
yes.
comrade! comrade! otchi tchorniya -- otchi tchorniya!
god, that's... this is ridiculous.
come on, fellas.
find the father.  that should clear things up.
course i'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  nice drinkin' liquor.
where? where is she?
look, not a single scene shot in the studio! we've found natural locations for the whole story--
the militia?
all i need is the one day.
yes.
make that 1790.
i never agreed to that.
relax. he liked what he saw. well, some of it. enough to give us a showcase audition. one week from today.
no rust?
oui, doctor, oui.
do you want the car?
i got a lot to protect.
oh my god, you guys! i can't believe we made it!
it's a hard winter. all the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. you'll see a lot of deer this winter.
you do?
"but the life of the james gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic jesse james."
you won't even tell me your name. what's shocking about a name?
darling, of course i do!
what is happening?  where's mason?
i keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then.  i call him smedley.  his real name is frankie jenkins - but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "frankie!" .. where is this leading to, mr. garrison?
why?
yes.
just a shotgun, huh? better let me take a look at that.
cynthia!
yeah baby. everything's great.
nothing, if you leave right now. there's a war going on all around us.  don't get in the way, please.
you used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
oh, yeah.
sure, mr. leland.  i'll be glad to.
who?
nah.  don't sweat it.
good-looking woman.
and you pose as a playwright. a situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
terrific.
about your being away all the time. must get lonely.
... more spores coming.
leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
you re not "some guy" anymore, hudson.  right now, you're the only guy.  without your help, i....
don't bullshit me! don't fuckin' bullshit me!
how many people go here?
jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. no one has ever beaten --
we don't need guns.
the english??
we scientists understand this. even we primitive scientists.  what exactly is the nature of your mission, mr. klaatu?
three hundred altogether?
we dated for about a month last year.
you're welcome.
oh. uh... 'hey, you! get your damn hands off her!'  george paused. you really think i should swear?
i have to go somewhere with mr. eddy.
they did it... they assimilated earth.
look, not having been there... i just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
joey never told you we went out, did he?
i know.  and nobody can make him.
i thought i was helping you.
it's you who's running out of time. you're starting to make mistakes now. you're wondering just how much i really know.  just how close i'm getting? well, i'm closer than you think, pal -- and i'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
goodbye
that didn't sound like thunder.
why not? half the house!
you folks need any help?
and look what happened.
i take out my slim-jim...
thank you, sir!
my adoptive grandfather. who knows what my biological grandfather did.
what the hell are you talking about?
don't worry. i'll ask you to do me a favor. you'll get the negatives and everything back then.
you're losing me.
*your* political future! i bought it for you and made you a present. and i can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. you got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  the man is--*miller*.
gilbert!
i don't know dude. that caitlin chick's nice. but i see that veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. she brings you food, she rubs your back... didn't i see her change your tire one day?
no, no.
what's a chickie-run?
you have a boyfriend?  of course you do.
no, thank you.
something about showing the world what principal collins has done.
are you going to stiff me?
[where are you staying in mexico?]
well... what   is   it?
yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
but i'm not a hero. i'm nobody's heroine..i'm nothing. you've said so yourself many times.
the greatest swordsman that ever lived.
brill.
they'll be returned, miss.
it's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
yeah sure. you're so repressed.
that leaves us no choice. we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth.
no big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
i apologize, sir, i'm having a bad day...
you got to be under twenty-five -
uh -- what?
all i could think of was... not here. i don't wanna eat it on an indian reservation, three thousand miles from home.
please, paul, 'til first light.
let's not get excited, sir.
he has come for lyssa.
i'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with honey's guy.  he was fooling around and honey caught him at it.  one girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
justin.
it was an act of god for christ's sake.
thank you.  he hasn't tried to contact you?
you loved your wife, surely.
i'm on my way to chicago. very important meeting tonight. well -- any new developments?
maybe if you didn't go rambo every time i did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. meantime, i gotta feed my little girl.
come now, mr. gardiner, before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand, did he not?
yes, daddy.
mine?
shut up, shut up!  it's beeping.
i don't need you to defend me, y'know, norm.
uh huh. under a safe conduct from me.
you had one guy "like that?"
malkovich!
hey o'neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
i have to go home and get my things.
<u>you</u> made it a problem when you let owens die like that. when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and i'll bet there were enough witnesses.
what are you talking about?
can that be, er, verified?  were you alone?
step aboard, carolyn.
please, kent, not now. i'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
i told you...
am i?
everyone describes the same process. at first it is exciting.  you're at the centre of the world.  as soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  and there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  your a clerk in a rather dowdy office.  there's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  you're a processor of semi-official news.  some people leave at this stage.  then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  you're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  professionalism.
i told you when we met i never wanted children.  i don't want kids in my life. we talked about it.  you weren't listening.
i was pushing as fast as i could.
i think i broke my arm.
let go! let go of me. oh my god, it's cops!
i want to try.
have we ever met before?
first paycheck?
when you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to berkeley, spent the night in golden gate park and begged for spare change in the morning?
we didn't abandon you, pete, we just thought you was a toad.
what?
i can't believe he'd do this.
<u>i.  am.  the.  biggest.  sissy.</u> <u>in.  the.  whole.  fucking.  world</u>.
a wolf without a foot!
baack!
ma che cazzo!
then why don't you want to teach it to me too? now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
i can't forget it. i'm still hungry.
i'm used to being on the outside looking in.  the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
you're a wimp.
it's not your fault.
pull up my sleeve. right arm.
sal, get 'em in the vault.
high speed train.  no-one gets on.  no- one gets off.  high security.  good place for a pass off to max.
just regulation size.  we have three like this.
hey. you noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
understood.  i just wish i was doing more to help out.
who gives a shit?!  it's not funny!
rachel, my daughter.  she's an honor student at parker.  my god, she's only nine.
in the den.
you're certain?
right here, woody!
uh, excuse me, i'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
--no way--
i know you have. c'mere.
it's simpler than that, brad.  a society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
red...strange?
look at upham, you don't hear him complaining.
north. it's north
go ahead.
not any more.
i think you should go home, but otherwise i think you should go. it would be great for you. you have to get away from here. the city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
lemme break.
mr. jones is dead.  so are two of his men.  the other three are in jail.  i have the disks.  i have walter smith. and you know what, you motherfucker?  i have you.
you wouldn't?
i dunno it's anything. it's a name anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
nope.
it could have been an accident.
you want me to check?
enough for everybody to breathe?
sure you know, son, but i think you've been having a little problem with it. it's okay, though.  what you're doing is perfectly normal.  it's like practice.  like when you play tennis against a wall.  some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  you do want a partner, don't you son?
kiss off.
it's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
she was jonesing for me.
you burned the score?
honey, go back to sleep, please!
that's the xke.
big bill
my deal is with rosanna. i knew you guys were up to something. are you two fucking?
frances, you're crazy.
yup.
you need to call it. i can't call it for you. it wouldn't be fair. it wouldn't even be right.
would you like to say something about killing, colonel?
i know, some are trapped, usually by money.
hoped for it.
our lady of misery.
shhhh. shhhh.
will you stop being silly, stewart?
seven hundred each.
he said he couldn't take us any farther. he has to go sell the elephants.
no.
dude, i can't do it!
look after that suit, eh. barbara chose it for me.
it looks old.     did you get it a long time ago?
believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. for you.
he was your snitch.
i guess i'll make me some trouble in that town.
what reputation?  you're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
shush!...time for bed anyway...  likely these'll need some takin' in...oh, martie, you're that gaunted! ...ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
i haven't given you much of a life.
okay, fine. sure
with a ramses graph on the binary tree--
young? she's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as lovejoy's kid. bernie. one she calls bernard. have you read the script?
look, i don't know what the hell you're up to, but i think i've got a pretty good idea.
tell him i said "hi".
...everybody wants the job.  no one wants the authority. except hendricks.  fine.  he can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  call me in new york...tell him to kiss my ass....
i'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
come on.  these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
and next time, miss annie, you can run down the calves...
look at the guy!  he just saved fifty people.  now he's going to disappear. who is he?
it sure isn't the fun-fair.
oh man, i'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
is scary.  but you want it.  gimme some truth here.
maybe you should think about it.
umm. three i believe. but i'm not sure.
people don't do that kind of thing. not in new york.
she left me. she's gone again.
won't they have maps?
well, i try to keep an open mind, but...
i'm in the bathroom.
forget it, judy.
you have her cell number?
go out and find her!
three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
oh, yeah? maybe she didn't commit suicide. she may have been murdered!
where are you going?
this is more difficult-
listen, i'd like to, but frankly.. i'm not even sure where it is, or even...
let's get some coffee and talk.
wait a minute, bruce. have you got that money?
did ya see what happened to anybody else?
what? how can you be so boring? tea!
what's this one eat?
we'll see you in a couple of hours.
well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  shaw, oswald, the cubans - all agency.
i don't want it reported!
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
you're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. we're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. jangle leg, biscuit, goldmouth, poker face, cookie, radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
it's good to see you, nick.
i know. i know.
we think it's ricky tan.  if you don't want to take the case, i'll understand.
i'll ring you in the next couple of days.
it was a powerful air.
how was your lunch with charlie?
--some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of. then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
as below, so above.  you hold the univers, willow, in your hand.
oh, would you...?
you hate that.
well --
we'll get you whatever you want.  get that other kid. we might need him.
oh.  what do you think about?
it's time you did some talkin', dr. mum -- wait a minute. that is your name, isn't it?
but...it's just a house i've dreamed about.  i dream about it all the time.  thank you for what you did last night.
when?
i'm serious, dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
nice tattoo, dietz.
oh great, tell her that! now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
no, my lord.
fuckin' jews stick together, don't they?
i couldn't stop eating steak. i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. i couldn't get enough. and then gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
we gotta get out of here. now.
oh yeah. there's just one thing i don't get. "monkeybone creator awakens from coma" that's a big story! that's front page news! but i can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> hey. don't i have a tv show?
however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.
but he had to dump the body there to make the move.
why?  so you can say, "oh, that's what you do." -- and be a smug little shit about it?
yes.
did i?
look, can we talk in a minute? i'm almost done.
you gonna tell on me?
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran.
then tell richardson to fire him.
i need to make a telephone call.
it couldn't have been.
sorsha, queen bavmorda's daughter.
page 22..  ring ring.  hello?
yes, sir.
i do.  how do i look?
nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
if she's right, and if you don't screw up.
andrew. you're not gay; you're ten. you shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
well, as long as i admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
it's the last house on the left. she lives downstairs.
no - but mr. rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
i told you!
i have no idea what howard doyle eats. i'm not a damn dietician.
he must mean after "slime creature 3".
look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
forty-two-hundred, i figure.
you don't have squat.
wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
i don't like those studs they've sent.  i want you to have pearls. nice big pearls.
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
and, of course, the u.n. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast.
no kidding.  if this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
no...
why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
i think i need to lie down.  bad shrimp.
we can't make it.
i wish you had. i'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
yes.  you have a brother in service here, do you not?  i forget his name.
but they were indians themselves.
right in front of the room.
you're too young.  sorry.
ich weiss alles.
how much would you charge me for the lips?
apparently, mr. wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. she said he would like it if i wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "american."
uh, atomic energy?
call her.
well, i just thought--oh, look at me. you'd think i'd never had a house guest before. would you like something to drink?
we changed our minds.
i think somebody's messin' around out there.
so what happened?
she's not with you?
would you have leaned over rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
yes.
we have to get out of here.
i'm fine.
young man, you will tell peincipal victoria this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases!
not yet...
yeah!
well, if he hasn't, i'm vastly mistaken.
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
look, let's forget it. let's forget the whole thing.
some guy in california. his name is redfoot.
kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  why don't you throw in another shark?
i got fired too.
underdog!  how can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  i'm the emperor why can't i kill him?  he could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
and that's why you've got to get rid of this money. if you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. it'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
i'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
if he doesn't shut up...
road's in!  now, soon as we hit bixby we start making phone calls. we could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>people</u> magazine...
what we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. i ain't callin' you no ho. but i ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. remember... you called me.
is it worth it?  a lot of witnesses here.
yes... well, i hope the crew got back safely.
oh, yes, i'm fine, thanks, just fine.
i'm not studying no mayor.  besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  my tenants and my ex- husband--goddamn-bless his soul.
no. any idea which channel he's on?
i beg your pardon?
where's kuato?
you've been out for about a day.
ho's a good guy --
y'know it is, a bit.
nothing.
hurt you, you sonofabitch? i could kill you.
they got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... let'em leave us alone.
yes.
rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
he fell.  he falls.
such as?
so - why the airport?
<u>where's the over-ride</u>??
nooooo! you fucking bitch don't you leave me down here, don't you - you
you're nosey, you know that, argyle?
uh huh...one point seven. and what do you project for this year?
uhh... i don't know.
that's so beautiful...
get it up!
this, this is life indeed!  life worth preserving, such life as juba never felt till now.
we were going to do it.
i know everything about your sister. i'll prove it to you.
over the water department, or over you?
well, i forgive you this time. but i'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. uh huh!
peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? bull shit. but one of our kind? not a whisper.
make a thousand of 'em. still won't be enough by the time i'm through.
that's just lovely.
no, it was a complete waste of time.
i'm late for the dedication.  then i go after freeze and ivy.  alone.
and where do you think jezebel comes from?
james.  it wouldn’t really be...
yeah. take it.
... they may have followed it <u>too</u> precisely.
narcissus will never support you, caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
would you say this "leon" was actually lee harvey oswald?
i was never very good at history. let me see -- there was miss olsen, and then there was miss rossi -- no, she came before -- it was miss koch who came after miss olsen --
only silence. it's always like this.
you want me to sit here and be passive. the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you'll let us go. i'm not there yet. you have to convince me you're telling the truth.
you'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, i hope. if there's anything you think we might be interested in...
two men left town right after it happened.
pontificated.
it can't be all that personal.
maybe miss wolf has them.
beautiful. what do you think? should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? if he's still alive.
maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. launch.
let's eat.
nice night for it.  i'll have louis send your car home.
i do.
chauncey, this is mr. dennis watson of the state department.
you have a headache?
i'll have a talk with her. by the way, you never said anything about last night ...
greate pate, but i'm going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
he can't piss standing up anymore.
no.
what's fleur-de-lis?
what for?
uhura, patch me in --
whah is dissdee?
if your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank.  and that makes you my new best friend. i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
with me you can always do business.
and have you any other truths to tell me?
i don't need a gun. where is it? if it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
don't look?
i'm staying here.
i am the one who is rotting. but i think your face looks graver than mine.
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers.
you steal a car?
you can't. death is god's will!
i'm sorry.
love doesn't have to be right. it just has to be love.
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint. jesus, wes, i killed the iraqis in there.
yeah, maybe i'm not. but we are, you asshole.
walter.
i'm on my way.
not now.
jake, be careful! what're you doing to the belt?!
it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it. take a look.
when we get to el ray, i'll take care of it.
i'm sure she did. 
yah, right -
what's going on, claire?
gillian --
we proceed, representing your estate.
eat shit....
what?
yeah... mmmm...
that means fuck all. the sympathy vote.
i don't.
soprano or alto?
excellent. dc mitchell is a rising star, mr. stevens. under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
the younger men have no respect. things are changing; i don't know what will happen.  michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
i don't know what you mean.
oh, yes. give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
oh god.
no.
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
yeah. you should check downstairs.
we were?
yes, no.
come on, just a little hint.
i had no choice. some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac.
a good choice. you wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
i'm sure you'll be very convincing.
like what?
i'm sure you know paul's been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books.
get it, please.
it's me who's wastin' time, sailor, bein' with you.
no, it's got a little left. they'll be in to change it.
did it seem short to you?
we're rising.
we're already renting cells to the feds for their overflow--
i know what you're thinking, okay?  you don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  you're retiring.  in six days you're all the way gone.
she pretends she's been sent by god! these charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
what?
then why'd you say that thing about tony janiro?
which one?
peter.  your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
she is going to be well?
hey, he'll be all right. believe me lana, i know. i was a late bloomer myself.
i know.
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, senator.  the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
booked them all at baskin- robbins.
wendell, i want you to come to work for me.
apple core?
no, tell me.
tell me something, wes.  are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  jaeger says you're crazy.
well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
this kid, joe early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
the gear is down.
no.
i don't know. he's your boy.
ah --
of course it is! that's why i'm telling you!
what will be?
what you got, peters?
i'm sorry, mr. dobisch.  you know i like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
i guess that's for the best.
the number's seventy-five. and it's applications and patents.
who sent you, thorpey?
contaminated substance. very dangerous. shooting mud.
ah, c'mere. i want to show you something.
i am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
no. you got it.
do you think this is funny?  some kind of joke?  you lost six people out there.
you're done yakkin', okay? you're done yakkin' now?
but you were coming up anyway, remember?
i've never sent a letter like that, you know?  i mean, i felt like i wanted to tell you something, but i didn't put it in the letter, and i didn't say it, but i want to say it now, i'm not sure if i should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but i think that i mean it, so, um, i just wanted to tell you...
that's good.
give me a break!
we're the government, cowan.
now she's going out with greg barnett?
fan works.
she's a programmer?
what happened?
if he don't know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
i'm sorry, ike.  this is permanent.
i brought the girl remember?
are you finished with me?
this gentleman or myself ?
what the hell is happening to me?!
it's the same way with cars. different cars. different tunes. you can't steal a maserati listening to sinatra. you gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that shit. but never, never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car. could lead to disaster. got it... ?
gee, i must have been shit-faced at your wedding, i don't --
you brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if i mind. mister, i don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
stop kidding me! four years in a town like los ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? you expect me to believe that?
-- remember?
ummm. it's good.
she wasn't in the...
hold on a second.
what! paul storms off.
a tractor beam...
shut the fuck up!
your father he is.
i was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit casablanca. that was a gross understatement.
now, hold on there. i ain't pullin' no shit. it's my money, i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
you're making it too easy.
i don't know. i'm completely in the dark here. that's what i get for moving away.
are you the type of person who takes advice, miss hillman?
have you two had breakfast?
nick, she won't say why.
my friend jack was just here.
you get down here!
it's started.
why?
gee, i better not, if it's okay. i still gotta drive back up to los ang-gleez.
is that cristaile?
two cases. and dinner when you land.
his father's dead, right?
those bastards at universal.  i made so much money for them, and now i can't get the time of day.
johnny, please. calm yourself.
go to the funeral?
why no. i hadn't thought of it. i feel rather flattered that you --
i wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. and i wondered if i could wait that long.
no... no problem.
good.  just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
a little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  it's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
daddy, are you upset that i'm still a virgin?!
i took yours from you.  your little girlfriend?  i took hers, too.  your meaningless, petty life?  i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  you're no avenger. you're mine.
i'm busy tomorrow anyway. i have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
forget it.
you're in violation.
alright.
i'm off for a pish. when i come back, that money's still here, ok?
brother, i hear you talkin'.
that's not correct.
for the moment.  but i fear not for long.  i'm of no use to him now.
of course not, joe.  it's just that i don't want to be left alone. not now, while i'm under this terrible strain.  my nerves are being torn apart.  all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
where i come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
and your folks didn't understand?
yes, mikey?
maybe. 
what happened ?
yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. cory does that to me when i hyperventilate.
well.  maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what i mean?
we're not confused.
me, too.
sooner, the better.
sooner--if you like.  see you again, i hope.
hey, pete... how ya doin'?
these are the only ones worth having.  and we're going to need them --
we've got to get out of here.  c'mon, hurry
even if i end up going to jail....
it's ed, if that's what you mean.
amends...?
i'll explain you, leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: my job, i'm a hitman and my employer is tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  that's why you can't have a bank account!
he watches it for me. it's better than waiting at a garage.
it's not in the river, is it harry?
give me the gun.
she don't know shit about the money.
oh brother. here we go.
i'm sorry. i was afraid something like this could happen.
hi, doc.  had a late call?
why me?
can't see a thing.
i don't know. i want him to lock me up.
well, now you know what it feels like.
you bet, hon!
you're very protective of him, randal. you always have been.
d.k. -- didn't know -- who i was when the options he bought took a bath. he reneged on me.
did you ever do one on wayne gacy?
i loved my taxi. went twelve hours nonstop. stopped only to pee. i peed under the manhattan bridge. peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
laura.
i think hemingway wrote somewhere... i can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  i think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
except --
see, i wouldn't think that about you.
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail.
i'm working on it!  it's what i do.  quinn...halloran.  i'll wait.  where's andy, can we get some coffee in here?
goldfinger's better than dr. no. both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, thunderball was a notable success.
i don't know. i don't want to find out.
nobody.
it is.
where is it?
dr. michaels... he went berserk...
well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. it's as clear as a bell outside. there's something i think you ought to see.
i'm no detective. i don't even know how to begin. all i know is i want to do something about all this.
you have evidenced great maturity, mary robert.  we shall have a serious discussion.
i'm sorry, viv'.  carlos has been on my back.  did you get the money up front like i taught ya'?
i know.  mr. eichelberger -- in the mortgage loan department -- last night he had a little halloween party here --
miss daniel? my name is klute -- john klute --
i don't know.
dr. lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
you are bitter, athos.  you are torn by grief, not only for raoul, but for d'artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
i'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
you need a new car anyway.
but who was the devil?
i roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "yo trabajo para jimmy herrera."
the kids okay?
how's it going?
can you quit?
are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government -- the white russians?
you bastard.
which one would you like to join, luthor? pick a hole.
what the hell would i do with that grease pit? besides, nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. then all this abilene shit happened. you heard about that bank robbery in abilene, didn't ya?
your attitude sucks.
what's this?
nonsense- samuel would have done something. 
this sophistication ain't tough. all it takes is a credit card.
she works at a church?
i called not only the boyds but the irvings.  neither of them received invitations.
so what's the problem?
he's good at what he does.
bent.
you learned this in some college course?
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
the director of our opera. count orsini-rosenberg.
and what are they, pray tell?
why does he trust you?
we hang down here and drop.  the garbage'll break our fall.
don't worry. she's good with kids.
you're gettin' the car.
oh hey, one more thing?
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie. everything.
we'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
i know we're early, we're so early. sorry.
working, thank you.
bye.
well what number are you trying to reach?
yeah.
like songs?
ted!
sweetheart--
go on then! pa's in the barn saddlin' the fort worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
a game?
and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
50 k don't get you to first base in the big apple, dad, not any more. i pay 40% in taxes, i got a rent of 15,000, i got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, i need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
you're out, aren't you?
find fergie, check the barns. i'll watch these two.
because he likes you.
no, thank you.
mission... statement...
i don't know, ang'. wadda you feel like doing?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
...in a really horrible way.
you'll go to the prison hospital.
well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
because my boyfriend, who i thought was in america, is in fact in the next room.
how about magruder?
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  and jumping in...
check it again. what about the global positioning satellite? could there be something wrong with the signal?
sorry, but i'm rusty on surgeons. who's the girl?
i'm working it!  nothing's happening!
believe me, i am.
because they said it couldn't be done.
now take it. go on.  listen, where can i reach you? cause i'm gonna make this right with you soon's i get me set up...
why did he go in the house?
and there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into rose's bedroom in the dark of night! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all i am going to do!
you're a sweet man, richard.
no problem. she can have it. i hate mountains.
engineer, we need warp speed now!
no...
the creator of what?
thank you.
uh-huh.
now you understand?
god knows.  anything.  contacts.  clues.
ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
phil for god sake.
rose... i don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. this has been a dream of ours for a long time.  sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion.
maybe they are.  maybe this is all part of the package.  the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
oh, some insurance man. are you in?
gruber...
still...
yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  if i can find your money, man-- what's in it for the dude?
good point.
but everything's ok?
oh, man, don't say that..
free, if you're the president.
yeah!
i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you.
three legs.
you're my friend, gus.
i do.
that bad, huh?
like you don't know.
don't lie to me, motherfucker. you apparently think i'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! don't you? say: clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. say it!
i've never met anyone like you in my life.
ross told me.
i'll cancel the reservation,  i found the name "zuul" in ...  the roylance guide to secret societies and sects.  i don't suppose you've  read it.
seven.
yes, sir.
she's my daughter.
now, look, fella, i saw you playing at ames the other night.
new york. that's up north, ain't it? they'll find we do things different down here.
why do you do this to me every morning?
jack, are you okay?
maybe i have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, susie.  you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob, the cia, fbi, and army intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  we got leaks everywhere! we're going to trial here!  what the hell do we really got?  oswald, ruby, banister, ferrie are dead.  shaw - maybe he's an agent, i don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
but shouldn't it be better? shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
would that marcus had lived.
short? it's ended.
kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
i don't know. i suppose so.
what's the other?
very smooth.  it's palmer, right? where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  really though... the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... i mean burn me for a heretic, but your god seems awfully small.
what?
i used to know how to cook.
when the queen commands it.
i mean i got federal price controls on my oil.  the ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  and i got your epa environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
okay then.  i'll do it.
aw, toby, we weren't doing nothing. we was just talking.
what's it mean?
mm.
i'm sure it don't.
tina, it's not like that.
it was in chinatown.
yes.  that's who i want to be.
i'll tell you why. i don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  personally, you can have all the credit you want. but for that deal - not a cent.
yeah, but where's the third guy?
let me rephrase -- i won't do that.
i'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
just in love with everybody. it's really a beautiful planet. i love you, rick. i love you guys. i love everybody.
john, please let me go with you! please, john!
i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel.  all i need is some money for the room.
do you like sex, mr. lebowski?
now?
yes, that's right.
i'll pick you up at your place.  i'll bring along the roylance guide -- we can read after we eat.
sir, i'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
you're making a scene!
but how will she look? the fashions this spring are very becoming to her. gentlemen, the judge will be french, the jury will be french, everybody in that courtroom will be french. have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
i don't mean everyone.  just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  or run a newspaper.
who?
that won’t be an issue, believe me. i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  no offense.
she doesn't know, mrs. kane.  she just sent it - because i made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
on the left.
...are you going to say anything to him?
probably an asteroid field ....
you.
do you wanna head back and call it in?
hold on.
so that was my part? smile and shake my ass?
i'm going after the black pearl. i know where it's going to be, and i'm going to take it.
it's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
get a ride with somebody.
television?
it's better than nothing.
i wouldn't like to, but i will, if i have to.
mr. chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
saavik, sir. we were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so i volunteered.
do they?
try the black knable.
was that supposed to make me feel better? 
l-lies... at first. about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' little bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on ned an' ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
i'm scared, grady.  i know it sounds crazy.  but, there's something trying to get into my body.
going on?
thanks, franky.
it's not that easy.
not much of a collection really. i haven't had the wallet for that, so i sort of live bottle to bottle. but i've got a couple things i'm saving. i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc.
i thought you could give us the tour this morning. sort of be our indian guide.
careful.
'drugged' is a stupid word.
we don't use the term 'negro' anymore. it's considered offensive.
sidney's father?
you heard me. out of here.
yes, i'm with the underhills.
for everything.
good.  let's go sailing.
mr. morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.

lesion, lesion in the temperal lobe. it's a kind of seizure disorder.

we've had this conversation already, daniel.
well, we sell other things too. cool stuff. "man from u.n.c.l.e." lunch boxes. "green hornet" board games. shit like that. but comic books are main business. there's a lot of collectors around here.
he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. before the clock runs out.
i don't
continental, but it doesn't matter. martin won't order from the menu.
when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh...  ...the powwow safe.
remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
did you not tell vada i'm a womanizer huh?

i'm not its master.
am i right or am i right?
sure.
blue. this blue.
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
i can't...and i won't.

how's the villa's security?
no.  mr. bianchinni asked me to do it.  i did it.
hell. the cia built that club.
a break for what?
where, the mall?
yes, major.  this looks like it's going to be it.
oh, i'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. oh, oh, pony, come on, give it to me! stud! oh!
see, i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
how are things in the pimp business, hey sport?
well..
yeah, if i don't make too big an ass of myself.
it's like that thing with the yellow ribbon...
tell you what. we're in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff. i'll get you up front with him during the flight.
egypt.
then make them suffer as she suffers.  how much shall i pay you.
quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
experience!
yes.
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now.  i can do it if i get out.
perhaps i should rephrase the question. what i mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
your prerogative, senator.
you don't have to explain yourself to me, deirdre.
you take care of yourself then, betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
marriage is happy news.

you just won't learn, will ya. hell, you come in here, i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  you're just like all them new jerks. lotsa nerve and no brains.  and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the big con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
kevin, next year...with you in ann arbor, and me in nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
yeah?  what happened?
but you're sure we've met, huh?
i told you about calling me boy. i ain't no boy. see, you and dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. you call me boy in front of my wife. you think i'm going to fix the roof? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.

he's important to my business.
lucky for them they didn't.
you still haven't kissed her yet ? don't lie.
pussy, ass, soft personnel.
i don't know. i guess it's cause my sister nicki had a baby when she was like 15. she was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
we trust you, lloyd.  you know that.
would you like to come in and see my house? just for a minute.
what's your problem?
mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
why.
i think you didn't get that lot in the navy, doing your national service.
still, make a note i recognized that.
no, it's just... no one's ever said that. and i thought if someone did ever say it, i'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "i love you too" cause they felt they had to after i'd said it.
everyone has foibles. then the whole country sees them on tv and mocks them. then we have... mocked foibles.
oh man, bucky.
and the white house?

mr. president--

it was just a little going-away gesture.
taylor's dead.
really?
he <u>was</u> a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
forty dollars.
well...i'm pretty sure i've --
the firm took in sixty.  that's three percent.  seemed like a fair bonus to me.
don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. i bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
i am not a bad man.
let us decide that.
we can go to one if you'd prefer.
that makes it unanimous. i feel all right too.
nothing, nothing, mr. dickson. don't pay any attention to me. i don't know what i'm saying.
but i have promises to keep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  got to fix the sea anchor.  use the sail.
it is a star!  that's great.  you're very good.
beverly hills hotel. i've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
what if shari's the dream?
is it a good room?
yessir, i can see that.
no, don't say it. another stray bullet to the head.
you have made such excellent use of it; i should think you will hate to leave it.
good morning, mr. dyle.
great.
yeah?  and what about my enemies?
what's it to you?
if we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
well, plus the money ain't that bad. dawn so, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
charlie, i thought i knew everything about you.
let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
that's not what he meant.
i don't set policy.  you have the key?
listen, i'm gonna take a steam -- did good last night -- shoulda seen it.
that's not...it's not like that.
we don't even know you.
no.  i'm going to be on that boat with sugar.
jesus christ.  i get in a good mood.  how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
she shot you down.
as fair as me?
you make it sound like, you know, i have no needs or something.  you think i'm too self-sufficient?
if they can give kissenger the peace prize, i wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find i'd won the preakness.
hey, i'm the one who kicked ivy's botanical butt.  personally.  me.  i did.
there's just one thing i want to know.
no quarter asked.  no quarter given.
there are a few other points we should discuss.  the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
you, jabez stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. or -- am i wrong about those contracts, mr. stone?
jed is having a slumber party new year's eve and he invited me.
oh...well that's okay.  cool.
on the deck of the yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  we weren't much older than they are.
she got to make it.
i'll go on the dole. like my daddy before me.
anyway, i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
that's not dirt...can't be dirt.. dirt is a violation.
yes.  unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can't afford not to deal with them.
uh..you're welcome.
i told you, my car broke down.
so is that what all this is? someone have a problem with us living here?
i guess.
i know.
rolls to his feet.  fire another burst.  kills the last of the german riflemen.  doesn't pause.  runs onto the field.
oh, for god's sake!
we figure out if it's in here.
let me think.  hmmnn...  never.  bye!
enough to get to jersey. i'll walk the rest of the way. i've been sitting a long time.  nice meeting you. it's been a trip.

our former commander was not... strong.

i have to get back, they'll miss me. please, jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
you wouldn't understand.  oh, god, i must be outta my mind. what would your momma think?
i don't need a geography lesson, luthor.
i said i wouldn't.
i'd fucking kill you.
hi! star.
one likes to live simply.
yeah, i haven't really absorbed that one.
me, i'm riding along, minding my own business. four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. i guess they admired my horse. she's a great one, a sweet little bay.
well, i'd love to see inside your club.
three months.  we learn quickly.  we adapt.  it is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
bunny lebowski. . . she is the light of my life.  are you surprised at my tears, sir?
git your shovel and git to work.
yes.
tomorrow's possible. do you know dinelli's? piazza di spagna?
i'm trying to quit.
well, i obviously do. and i also know that leon’s not here, rhian. but i thought that you might know where i should look for him.
i'll go with you.

you'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. there's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. in between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. and sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  the studio always hated that. oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
peter, this is serious.  i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
you think i care about her?  i'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
it's loaded... i got some shells in here.
and i *love* her! there ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as i do!  i wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, homer--you must know that.
i know.
your attention, please. may i be the first to say, it's a raid!
i gotta go out for a while.
cool.
for what?
what in the hell do you think i'm doing? taking out her tonsils?
nothing.
you know what this tape could do if it gets out.
maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
he's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
ted was a good worker.  but, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. look, i know he had problems, i understand that.  i've got problems, everybody's got problems.  but i've got a shop to run, i can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
thank you, doctor mccurdy.  your witness.
the mitchell barbecue three years ago.
sometimes, when i feel weak, i have these...visions.
i live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  i saw you kiss.  admit it, this is the street where love lives.
i don't know... i felt like... like i was suffocating... christ, zack... i was so scared... so godddamn scared...
erica. so do you think you and i are alike, erica?

that's a nice name.  ok, let me see it.
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
it's not my car, now is it?  it's laura's car, and thus laura has it. so it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. wow.  fucking great.
ha! and what do you have to do for him?
because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. this is standard horror movie stuff. prom night revisited.
what's the matter?
sir?
that.
if-if my car is there, i could be the one who... why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
didn't you here all them sirens? it's been all over the radio.  some guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the trattoria roma.
who are you kidding, doc? you or me?
no.
fine, fine. swell, you just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and i'd like to reciprocate. listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and i'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
i'm getting a taxi.
that's father at work, what'll i do?  peter, what'll i do?
yes.  yes.  sometime.

schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
gee, let me think. "do you want to..." is that the best you can do? some tired hand me down rehash? hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. no movie rights. nothing. i've been through this before and much better i might add.
they always are.

i said stop it.
i see. forgive my cultural ignorance.
what do you think?
his paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
you must be joking -  when there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. now, let me have that sheet.
what? that's just gordon's bad taste.
i can't.
here's the terminal.
what!
i'll say.  i had two ponies drowned under me.
neil, you're not gonna...
eddie, what kind of movie is this?
ridiculous! just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up. you never saw me before. shit, this town is full of white cadillac convertibles. i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. you ready?
peter kelson?
iraq? shep, you're fired.
yeah?
see you later.  good luck.
dad.

in international news, india plans to release crocodiles in the ganges, the holy hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
a hospital? what is it?
jim, in your absence, genesis has become a galactic controversy... until the federation council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of genesis... consider it a quarantined planet. and a forbidden subject.
no, we got pressure from california state. the man practically has clemency. we can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
what is it? what's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.

far cry from new york.
out the door and to the left.
some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
but they are not ny people. you look at me as if i am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq, did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces you will never see? did you cry for their wives and children. they were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
sure... tonight. then please stay at my place.
you shouldn't be here.
come on.  let's get out of here.

victor. this place looked like a charnel house. what went on here?
nice night.
you know what would taste good? chicken. i haven't had chicken in a while. chicken would really hit the spot about now. chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  where's a good chicken place around here?

yeah, in this book there's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
you know, miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. this might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, massey, but...  i like my women with two boobs.

you'll have to take my word for it.  we don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
when i was a little girl, on cold nights like this, i used to crawl into bed with my sister.  we'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
that's right.
i had the group liquidated, you little shit. they were insolent.
we don't think that's necessarily bad. at least it's a point of contact.
int. darlene's store - night.

but i'm just trying to leave.
no, no.  i was wondering...man oh man. i think i feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that i came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but i think i'd be a fool if i didn't do something i really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
i can't believe i lost an eye for a bunch of phony c.d.s

scientists. very intellegent men.
good luck.
sort of, um...
no, sir, he is not.
agh--
uh, no.  how do i get to beverly hills?
what are you doing?  this is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
no.
houdini mice.
at the airport.
i am not! i'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
i'll take you about. got some nice things.
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley.
i'm not like you!  i'm not! you're cruel -
sure. where they're negotiating. in the company office. we'll go up there and picket the place.
well, i was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. it's in the xeno galaxy. or it was. it was called krypton. that's k-r-y-p...
you nut!
i know the number.
don't pity me. pity the polish lancer. after all, i'm alive.
remember those words.
easily... the question is, can we save ourselves?  be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
darling!
i don't want old sad bastard music either.  i just want something i can ignore.
that's right trevor. the timing was impeccable wasn't it? it's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. just need you to id it for us.
and what's your line, mr. meadows?
yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. a key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
whatever it is.  go <u>do</u> it.  how you doing on the permit?
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
what were you, following me?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
well, then, talk to me some more.
i'm only half human.
these people are professionals. they don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
sure.
no, i just don't feel like it. that's all.
where'd she get you?
hide him.
hey?
well, betty and twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. i just wish i had more time...
no! i mean, of course not. no.
he's parted his moorings.
i'm used to paying my own bills.
tell bill to get the fuck off!
give me a stick, pretty boy! i'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
oh really, well i hope something changes your mind some day.
"emperor miguelito...?"
oh -- all right.
look, man, did you--
you. what?
tell thea i'm sorry....
chops?
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
well done, sire!
crashes into a jeep and totals his neck.  that's carl...
eric!
no. go back to the woods. this is a sacrifice i need to make. in my world we have something called penance. it's another abstraction, but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. it doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. see, i could never be free again anyway, so i might as well be in jail.
snifter are for warm drinks --
i wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
it there's one thing i don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
you should think of me as liza sutton's guardian angel.
stick around... larry, one of my "gang" -- bud fox.
it's your call, will. what do we do?
what the hey. let's go for a drive.
there's plenty of fruit.
i did, claude. i mentioned you. i mentioned you both. but the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. the kid can hit. what can you do?
hard working, have a wife and kids...
it's just my stupid way of getting attention! god, i practically love you, josh!
fine, dixie. fine.
i think ming is older than tong.  what is this?
the girls like it loud.
no.
what do you want?
who are you talking to?
'able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
stop knowing me so well.
this is how we've managed to last.
well, there's my boys.  shit. i gotta go. looks like i caused a ruckus with that shot. half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours.
business is slow. i told my boss about you, about your condition. he told me to try and rent you another room.
of course.
i mean, i'm a deist.  a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin.  surely you knew that.
he wouldn't leave her.
hey, now -
there ain't no snakes in here, mister hendershot.
is there any other way to take it?
it's chemistry, andy. nothing more. mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. there were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to.
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this.
i hate to do this, fella.
why not?
what?
actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
she told me not to talk to you.
you're sure you want to do this?
crafts?
that's right. now who needs to trust who ? trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, i'll put you in the hot seat.
do you want some food?
she wouldn't let me.  she's the only reason you're alive.
why, they won't either. she looks pretty. and i wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. don't listen to him, rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
the mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at lombardi's.  and call me ich.
shit... shit... what shit?
better than a pile of dead teenagers.
humor me with specifics.
of course. our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
it's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt.
you're not?
how come you don't know it?  how can you say you hate the jews when you don't know anything about --
hey to bluestar, as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad...
it was no fucking accident, frank. the little one ...
i thought you were punishing me.
what?
i wanted to be alert for your visit today.  especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital.
firefly.
i won't deny i was ambitious.  when i had my... experience... i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  i'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  you didn't answer my question.
big truck went right by before you opened the door.  life on the fault line.
how much am i paying?
what are you thinking?
just like that?!  you just knew?
okay, i'm not sayin' i didn't -
grown man dressed like a clown. does he really think he looks good?
pull up at the drugstore, will you, max.  i'll get you some.
he's just around the corner.
do you have a car, steph?
but i'm always home by morning.
but, elaine --
no, this one's for real, peter.  spengler went down there and took some pke readings. right off the top of the scale.  buried the needle.  we're close this time. i can feel it.
one more item--not on the check list.
i don't care. you pick.
sorry.
didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
it's hell week. i'm pledging the deltas.
why are you telling me this?
so he really loved her?
you lying bastard...
why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
forget it, pissboy!  you tell argon he can call my lawyer.
oh, that.
oh my god... you mean... the two of you dated?!
you look good yourself.
no. the needy. us. cos we need this car!
ben.
no, no! you don't understand, i love you! it's real love and i can't help it! please kiss me, mr. hillyer, i love you, i love you so much...
i don't blame him. what should i do with the ice?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. so in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. that's those little bar codes, you know? the universal product codes?
we're not messing with you...
the friend of john's that was staying at your house.
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies...
i wouldn't mind going down with her.
that’s the one...
but... but why, harry...? why'd they do it?
that doesn't bother me.
oh, god. i miss her. i can't believe she's with that guy now! i'm never going to see her again. i love her so much. what a fucking monster she is!
yes, i'm ready.  goodbye, rick. god bless you.
well of course i'd want to give her that.  i mean, what do you think, i don't care about her?
okay, sir. i'll discuss this with the broker and i'll get back to you. you're welcome.
well ain't you amazing.
well, all the same.  if we get to missoula, help me find a car.  i'd appreciate it.  then...you can...
anytime.
they were just bad men, that's all.
got anything to drink in there?
hello.
it means... &quot;the lie.&quot;
some money.
but listen, glenn.  if you're lying to me...
no, mama, i'll take care of it. i'll wash them in the morning.
what does a big old wooden house on the corner of eddy and gough street have to do with her?
where do you think she's going?
good morning, jennifer.
colwyn, don't be a fool. you can't do battle with that thing.
why?
is it?
tubbs listen!  i don't know anywhere else to go!  i need your help!
oh jesus.
it is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
you called us, doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  i'll drive you down...
i didn't spit on you!
he missed me.
now, mister ambassador.  in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone.  i intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
it changed.  why?  okay, back over your wrist.  because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
tough shit. we need to t-t-talk about this--
you mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
will you leave me alone, already...? no, sean, it's over... i don't care... as a matter of fact, i am... yeah. in his hotel room...
who told me wh...?  you've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  you've got a board-up on the window...moss told me.
lula tell you she's pregnant?
i'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
my mom is gone.
sounds good, talby. let me know if anything important comes up.
-- just --
but i want to say with you,
what are you talking about?
the reason?
now, none of that.  please dig in.
what?
no, you're shielding her. let her face the world.
upstairs, asleep. where'd you think?
then please - do this test for me.
don't think i won't.
well, i did. every one of them. mostly i remember the last one. a wow finish. a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
you want me out...  is that what you're saying?
you don't kill anyone.
i'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
good, i believe you already know my, uh, son --
you'll cap my ass as soon as i step out the door!
think of the scientific data we'll gain. come on, lets get out of here.
in a manner of speaking.
ah! well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
promise?
well, i've been moody and dissatisfied.
they come in any other styles or colors?
talk to me, hudson.
oh frances, do i have news for you! guess who --
your friend?
i'm right behind you.
it'll take us to budapest if you're not careful.
well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
how about new york?
they're killing everyone. the lady minister! the un soldiers. they're at the gate.
can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
a trip, you mean?
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy.
what line is he in.
what a terrible thing to say. how could you even think that?
what do you think?
uh huh...
who's the girl?
that's ridiculous.
you're unbelievable.
yes. i wrote it.
why in god's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
it was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  but you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
what do you two fight about?
go to! what, goodman boy! i say, he shall: go to; make a mutiny among my guests?!
i don't know if i'd go that far, sir.
no one.
nice suit.
he's nice.
i'm sure.
in the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are g-o-n-e and you are f-r-e-e. now, i know i put you guys through hell, and i know i've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. scotty, help me pick richie up, and lay him down. jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "digayo." when you get to digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "the titty twister." from what i hear, you can't miss it.
i just wanna kiss, that's all.
nonsense! she got at she deserved.
well, i wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
i know.  i've got one too.
sod.
she's working. i need a break anyway. she's getting a little clingy.  this is our day!
i don't believe it. the marquis de sade? you're actually publishing his novels?
see that?  who needs affection when i've got blind hatred?
morning.
oh, come on--you and grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. when dad--
nice to meet you.
my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  i spent three years on the stage, you know.  remind me sometime to regale you with my lear.
uhura... can you modify the probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
"future" of...?
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
i thought it was great.  you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
that would be me.
oh, ahh, oil change, i...ehh...i just drove in from chicago and uhh...nice hair.
how awful.  what will you do?
why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
motherhood.
it isn't the money. we're after circulation. what we need is fireworks. people who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
...<u>nothing</u>...
i'm afraid i can't, sir. you have to go through the proper channels.
okay.  how many going out?
we'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the collective.
well, why you always walking behind me?
it's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  but he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
i chose the wrong passage.
uh...
that's crazy.  he's not going to kill us.
she said it on her tape.
never?
<u>ho</u>tel.
i pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than i should.
i said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
you promised me an explanation.
keep your voice down.
you were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
but that was part of it?
but where would we go?
course you're feeling fine ... you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city.
well, you'd best get something. even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  i want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  put out an apb with a description and see what we get back.
i think you'll make a good teacher.
that's four.  let us know if it starts moving, burt.
they can't hear me that's why.  oh god... i don't wanna...
i dunno. you know.  i used to really love that alice. do you know that?
oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the roto-rooter.
probably....
nobody in this town really understands junior. when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family. actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
little bit.  yeah.
you're too demanding.
i think that's the whole point.
you know, baxter -- i'm doing some research at the columbia medical center -- and i wonder if you could do us a favor?
my name is henry krinkle -- that's with a "k." k-r-i-n-k-l-e. i live at 13 1/2 hopper avenue, fair lawn, new jersey. zip code 07410.  got that?
man, you're bringing me down!
it's none of my business?
thank you. what do you do, barry?
i'm supposed to understand this.
what are you afraid of, dad?  that i'll fall head over heels for joe -- well, i have -- as you did with mom.  that's always been standard, whether you like or not.
i can't get it to come out right.
yeah -- hey, did you see the little mermaid on tv the other night?  that ariel, whew.
-- what do you think?
not really.
aye --
he's with us... he's with us...
say what?
wannabee nigger...
about what?
we'll call you back.
osgood - i can't get married in your mother's dress.  she and i - we' not built the same way.
we have to start simpler, is that it?
thank you.
i know, hannah.  look, i'm not going to get an abortion.  i mean, i always planned to get married and have kids - i'm just going a little out of order. kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'course, that was a long-long time ago.  but no matter what, she held her head high and said... "pappa don't preach, i'm in trouble deep.  pappa don't preach, 'cause i'm keepin' my baby.  hey.  i'm gonna keep my baby." the great one...
hell of a day, ray. yankees are on fire.
i have no choice.
nothing that can't be exchanged.
we desperately need a spice rack.  desperately.
there is something very not normal going on here!
read me what she said.
eh bien... t’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  la petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
good to meet you.
and now i'm taking it back.  we're getting smith out of the house.
you are most kind. we will be proud to assist you!
only the real stiffs.

get away from me...
i'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  did dad have a brother?
last year? it can't be that long.
just, i mean, well, you're here every single day.
yes?
and almost got tossed out of the academy...
the barretts from rubicon bay came by in a new speedboat.  rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  that was three hours ago.
then you'd better go, george. this is no place for you.
we don't have time to argue, susan.
f-f-fuck you.
maybe.  i'll call him.
joe?
routine! i don't have a routine. and if you think that's what this is -
you're quite serious about this, aren't you, buckaroo.  we know each other pretty well, i think.
that's okay.  i'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
uh-huh.  and when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
what if i went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
do you know it?
this could be it.
oh.
it was my specialty, sir, i trained several thousand over the years.
jump in.
it's just that i'm very worried about madame.
they told me you were dead.
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? it's all been denied. you tell your publisher--tell katie graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. good christ! that's the most sickening thing i ever heard.
i have!
is this the wish of the masses?
there's nothing fast enough to catch that. forget it. it's over.
sorry, sugar. go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed.
morning!
up ahead.
they have safaris for tourists now. maybe you can convince your husband.
i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i'm starting the blonde legal defense fund.
no thanks.
i don't think you're gonna make it.
check out the personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
they've got her!
that must have made you proud.
i do.  i do want to.  that's why i'm leaving.  that's what you given me, see? i know what i want now.  i want a guy like you for real.  not because you buy me things and give me money.  the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. you gonna give me that?
no, nothing.
maybe.
i'm coming, what's the rush?! ohh! what's that?! there's stuff all over the floor! i can't see a thing!
what is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
no.  you were right, i was wrong...  ...max.
there's a different between want and
i demand action.
no, ma'am...  mama, i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is, so me and sounder can go see him.
about two years before.
well -- you want me?
lloyd, give it up.
i'm not listening.
you sucked that guy's dick?
mr. dean--
she said you were very beautiful.
we were married. then she was taken by the slayers. you must help me.
they don't really attack underwater and--
it's been three months.
mcconnell, i'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
well... in a newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
yeah.  maybe he'll call.
...not the bat?
we're gonna get caught. i know we're gonna get caught. they were eyeballing my car.
yes, sir--
hold her, boys!
melina, hauser sent me to do something.
now you gotta learn the correct slang.
let's just say, he looks after your interests.
my name is kazim.
two hours.
you mean you can't fall in love?
well, surprise, surprise, i've been on the payroll for several years now. i still have an office and secretary. no one even batted an eyelash. do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in new york ?
we were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
yes, this is not life, will. this is a stolen season.
you have?
did she, or did she not smile?
murray had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  i think they're kind of interesting.
madame colet, i've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  i was a school friend of your husband's ...
i care about you, a - but i just don't have those kind of feelings for you. i'm sorry. i'm not in love with you.
dude here.
not me. nope. you must've been dreaming.
...this's <u>good</u>...
babalouey, you were perfect, i could hardly keep from busting up.
jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. she-she was too busy getting raped by cossacks.
oh. that.
great, get in. we'll switch off in a bit.
we can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
is he going to be okay?
will you marry me.
good.
what, you're goin' off, too?
it didn't happen.
if there's a train.
please... that's enough. i *loved* you, too--you know i did.
you see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one pacino wore in serpico? you don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
may i?
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  when we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  all they did was observe and report.  nothing more.  but catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  she understood. and the patient responded.  edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  he knew she cared.
i don't buy that hot dog shit.  so you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to haleiwa.
i beg to differ, doctor. you work in a madhouse. your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
i know of your fondness for antiques.
yeah 'women.' if i was a fag i could get laid in a subway.
i'm sorry, sir, i have no intention of making light of this committee. and i have no intention of incurring your wrath, mr. chairman. i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. they've sent me letters from jail.
then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
alright.  let's...  page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  you know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  it could be his...
you go, thomas.  you get out, and i'll stay with daddy.
she was very beautiful. kind, but...sad.  why are you asking me all this?
he is dying. he knows it.
but how could he know?  he only just met me.
you're not thinking of going some- where, are you, bill?
sorry.
well, perhaps i shall like it in casablanca.
checking out your place.
this play?
yes.
uh-huh. lived there till i was twenty or so and then moved to chicago when i got married.
it's tougher than it looks.
really, why?  sorry, i'm completely lost.
after fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
and you'll face that danger head-on.  as if i could stop you.  and you have my complete support in this matter. anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
but... why... what's the point?
i know what it means--segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate chapin. and that would put us inside the white house.
good! but you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! you'll get that woman in trouble!
she intends to change the future somehow.
oh no -- no -- the session is over. let's go, it's off. thank you, gentlemen. 
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all.  i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
you make it all sound so simple.
stop him, jessica!
what am i doing?  i'm just telling walter the truth.
and you thought she'd come up here, to me? if she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
this wasn't the deal! the deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a mafia war.
you're a pms werewolf. of course. frida, are you on drugs?
lingerie...
everyone is dead there. the dogs eat the bodies in the street. i have to go.
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile.
seems george isn't making too many friends in lockup.
do you like massage?
bye!
and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.
yeah aren't you forgetting something gordon: rule one, capital reserves. this company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. that buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
they are my friends.
i knew it.
you all right?
he's got like six gold records.
well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
he's-a very easy to insult --  i say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
here, tim ... tim.  i'm as frustrated as you, henry, but don't you think this one's a democrat problem.  they started the war; it makes them look bad.
they don't send planes to put out machine guns.  two flank runners with surpressing fire.  i'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
here's to the greatest job in the world.
i'll take it.  what's the matter, mr. burns -- don't you understand english? -- why, your language is shocking, mr. burns -- positively shocking! i don't mind because i was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose central is listening in... oh, did you hear that, central? we ought to report him, don't you think?... oh, fooey on you!
chicken blood on the crops.
dad!  save yourself!
no.
yes. your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. and, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. but bonnie, who is the real victim here? let me suggest the following. your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
my oath of celibacy is on record captain. may i assume my duties?
she didn't even know you. .
what about relatives?
it's ok. it's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
i did everything i could to forestall this, paul.  i don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  but there's been too much talk.  the thing's out of hand.
that's why they got you in jail?
certainly not.
can you fix it?
her doctors murdered her.  they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    her doctors murdered her.
all of us are typing and clicking, george.  whether we want to, or not.
what's wrong with your paisley tie?
yo... you know why rammellzee's here, don't you?
thanks.  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
me? no. don't want none either. such bastards, man.
let my kid go.
he's busy being dead.
off with his head!
wait a minute, mollie.
you were asleep.
so she say, "you're spilling the milk." so she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk i spilled, so she got me so mad, so i said, "mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" so i took the bottle, and i threw it against the door. i didn't throw it at her. that's just something she made up. she goes around telling everybody i threw the bottla milk at her. i didn't throw it anywheres near her. well, i was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
regent beverly wilshire.  i bet you know it.
do you know him?
nothing like a little liveliness.
what?
jesus christ, ann. why is anybody anything? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
rachel's job is she works.
that i am not rheya.  that rheya died.  killed herself.  i'm different.
isn't it? isn't it! you know i was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
well, we all got to go sometime.
can i use the bathroom?
dr. grant!
give my regards to your managing editor.
half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
you know what, wes?  if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
why did you wait so long?
nice lady.
where are you hiding him? he's impossible, isn't he?
well, everyone is friends here on hy- brasil.
yes.  great.  kevin, i'11 send bean in to keep you company.
<u>did</u> i?  i think you're mistaken.
well, you gotta understand, i'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
you know it. stay black...
creation? or its opposite?
turn-offs?
did that hurt?
i don't need no more clothes, thank you.
he never says his name.
hi dad.
um...
will you guys shut up? god. it's like having two little kids in the car.
what of it?
why? you were so pleased with him.
cease fire! withdraw!
you came up my river -- in that small boat. so simple. i always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  you are the final justice, aren't you?
what's the apartment house number?
caesar?
what's going on in there, starck?
night watchman who found the body. sweet old man.  been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  not a likely suspect.
she's very pretty.
you!
he was very easy to hate. if you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
oh, god, that's too much responsibility for me.  it's not fair!  i want a less complicated life, frederick.  i want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
yes.
er, good luck, yes.
oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
that would be impossible.
well she --
i'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you. where've you been hiding?
oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. amado is into this big tejano roots thing and i've never been further than ciudad leon--
this is something else.  they're curious.  curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
i see bud because i want to.  i see bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
don't worry, honey, i'll protect you.
attack? who -- or should i say what from?
caesar, i'm leaving.
i thought you would have some ideas.
he'd give me a job.
the hell you didn't!
all of them?
no, i'd better not.
they can't pull this on me. it isn't fair--i don't believe this--
are we bringing home strays now?
look, todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
uh-huh...
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about.   this is just a whole 'nother ball game!
your serve. two -- eighteen.
that's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
who is it?
yes. perhaps he would at that.
i see.
the access code's been changed.  your card won't work anymore.
you know, i had a crazy dream last night. it was about you.
you wrote his scripts for him?
you interested in a little work?
do you have a mirror? it's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
okay.
okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, martin?
please, papa, i have a secret path.
yeah?
the same.
i don't want to take 'em out.  just want to keep 'em interested.
you've seen him. you're also familiar with how last week he died?
that's trust.  mr. christian trusted me implicitly.
i'm tryin' to.
pretty terrible shot.
you always did.  can i give you a hand with that?
is your script much like the novel? jerry says it's very good.  but you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" you know?  i sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  don't you find?
louise is alright.
i left in a bit of a hurry.  i'm terribly grateful, sean.
you're not one of those guys from the military, are you? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
you were ringing the doorbell!
i'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
and what would'st i gain from this bargain?
they're very nice.  let me get my coat.
my client... is dead.  but i think he's a free man.
turn that thing off, will you?  it's driving me nuts!  what's rosebud?
i have looked bad for four years. everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. thank god looks don't matter as much as they once did.
he was that good?
you're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
no, give me my damn money back.  right now, and i don't have no damn receipt neither.
can't you get contacts?
for a while.
better than i remembered.
i aspire to be more than i am.
sure we could run him. you realize he's already head of his block association.
i see you.
what made you think that?
i'll get right on it.
go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  and someone will tell me what to do.
but going in that church, i'd be stooling for you, charley. you make a pigeon out of me.
i need to speak with an agent lowry.
alvy, i can't say that that's true at this point in my life. i really just can't say that that's true. i mean, you know how wonderful you are. i mean, you know... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. anyway, look, i don't wanna- listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
don't be talking about my mama.  or my ass!
that's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
you sure i can't go with ya?
what's that....?
they could put you in jail.
sean --
do what?
well, let's go talk to your doctor.
someone wants to play with me?
you destroyed his memory! his mind! his identity! and, you want to do the same to me!
forget it.  you go ahead, i give up. i...i don't know what i was thinking. "insectopia".
be it so ordered. the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  this hearing is adjourned.
my name isn't damon bradley.  i just told you it was damon bradley.
don't you have to be at the office?
no. it's the inner light. and with it we can defeat anything you've got.
alone tonight?
where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from?  everywhere.
i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father's name is nathan lee morgan, and...
but...
yeah, heh heh. i thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
exactly, charlie! you understand what i'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. because you're a real man!
i need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so i can cut off his nuts.
i swear to god i had nothing to do with it ...
oh, but this one is so simple.
you are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  that was my misfortune.  that was your misfortune.  i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was.  i had no choice.
they seem native to the planet.  it's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  it's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
i just wanted to check that you were okay?
when you put your mouth to his, susan, it seems a frequent thing.
i’m not trying to knock the tire business, jack.
no.
i woke up the next morning and she was gone.
what'd he get you?
shit...
never had a doubt. never did. us kirby men, we stick around, huh?
you know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. you can buy child whores, slaves. you can have people raped, killed...  one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan. he usually isn't in this country.  how'd you hear about him?
aw, bytes, he's sick.
of course, this one's a gimme. just be patient, even ol' bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
then we will both die traitors, d'artagnan.
afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him -- love.
contact starfleet command.
oh, baby, what an idea. i'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
there's somebody lookin' for me. not police. just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
things changed, mary. the reasons for finding jacqueline changed. i want to find jacqueline to settle things.
brimmer! could you come in here please?
intention?  intention, senator?  we are talking about mankind here.  his fear.  it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  studied for weaknesses.  and eventually wiped off the face of the earth.
the kid's with them!!
i have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
it's none of your business.
nevamind 'look'...this punk bastard...i call him at work...i say 'johnny boy there?'...he doesn't even show up for work anymore...
homesearchers.
i'm not a comedian.  i have no talent.  i'm a song-and-dance man.
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
i'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post oklahoma city. i hear you're an important figure in those circles. you have a lot of interesting ideas....
they're inside --
you follow the law and do the best you can. it's all there.
hide me somewhere deeper? somewhere buried?
oh, come on, rachel. no way.
do you love me?
you never asked them about it?
jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. that it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
do you think you could answer that?
fixing the mower.  i saw my father today.
how did the car get back here?
good luck to you too, paul.
you don't exactly look like drug dealers.
the job's real. -- but the agency set it up.
i know precisely where he'll be.
i think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
he's running us 'round in circles. look for yourself. look!
yes, but...  he was having an affair.
then so be it. if you believe what that indian said we were fucked either way.
will you do me a favor then?
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
sandra started without us. we can stay. he kisses her again, then breaks away.
yeah.  we did.
your birthday, amy --  as she goes) -- and i have something for you in my locker. a present.
but you appear quite fresh, my dear.
that what you think?
that's life.  my kisses are alive.
he never misses.
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
no, not really. i come from an "area". bel air.
well, i shall deny him to you!  he is evil on earth!
i dress up when i want to make an impression. - so how'd it go?
of course, that's what they're for.
that's not why i'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer...
i don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
a minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
absolutely!
come on, come on...
connie...
i'm in it as we speak. [beat] you're haunting yourself right now. [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. you didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, dr. becker. it turned out different, didn't it?
yeah but no one ever sees that. i like a man that'll tell you he's married.
ooohh, nothing.  i just got fired, that's all.
well, it was nice meeting you. enjoy the rest of the trip.
bullshit.
charles, i must apologize again, for the kronos mishap.  it was a scary few minutes around here. wow. but thank god, the complaint was found. and no damage was done.
figured out what?
really? you see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. there should be, like, a line behind you.
don't do this.
y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
ah he dislocated his shoulder.
..sorry...
bloody.
what?
i don't remember!
i know it's you, grady, i just... christ, grady, do you know what time it is?
uh-huh.
oh, miles. that's awful. what are you going to do?
hey.  ain't your call, man.
what time was this?
it's spring break. i don't want to go to a will reading.
where are you going?
well, i wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all i wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
everything is quite all right.
uh... okay... um...
you say that as though it's some awful thing!  i never stopped loving wally!
do you recall my instructions to you, starling? what were they?
tell me about it...
i just fnished work. i counted the bags.
yeah. yeah, i'm jealous of mtv faggots who are named after animals.
aye.
i have.
make out with you for free.
they can have the estate.
why don't you tell me.
she likes to see you off in the morning.
they're closing the granview. you know, theater down on biscayne?
it doesn't make any difference anymore.
then tell me, what will happen? tell me!
go ahead.
all right, grab the bat. let's see what you can do.
later. go back to sleep.
... i know it's you, bruce. i'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
you just blew up a house in paris! this program is over.  call it off.
terrific.
you have a pimp?
aqui! [here!]
you are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
i'll take that as a compliment.
five... so far.
and josé, my ace, lots of transshipment.  lots of action. skies are crowded.  and the jit has assets on land, air, and sea.  so any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
oh my god!
a little petting is not the issue!
clear and open on my mark. three... two... one... mark.
what kind of infection?
with whom? where?
so i shall avenge my master's death after all.
bite radius.  you know, the size of the mouth?
erin. i'll always be with you.
we're looking for him. in your opinion, why did frank kidnap dorothy's son and husband?
he's the original. there are no carbon copies of that one.
well, i really don't smoke.
i could use the walk.
president's speech.
precisely.
your honor, i'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
this isn't about us.
i think three...
because i never assume anything.
deals?  my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. you'd have to be more specific.
amnesia?  you're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
forget it.
okay, mister. whatcha payin'?
uh, what do i call you?
it's true!
you know her?
luke!
but what about all these other people?
now how far would further out be?
before black vomit starts its set, don will have his head blown off. the papers next week will reveal that he was partners with bobby, johnny, and collie in 'the grendel records scam.'  he killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  and then the mob iced him.  it's all more tasteful than it sounds.
it's a common reaction, jim.  i'll tell you what it is, and i know that that's why you married her. one of the reasons is prudence. it's a sizable investment.  one thinks twice...it's also something women have.  it's just a reaction to the size of the investment. monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  this woman can cook...
i know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
mama is outside with josie mae and earl.
what?
agnes...
your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  i guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? i wasn't thinking. you don't know anybody?
just a minute. you made a couple of cracks before and i let them slide. but i don't intend to take any more. if you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
no chance in hell, mr. garrison. i'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  you, too.  i can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... keep digging.  y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy.  that's important - it's historic.
yeah?
what is your idea of being a jew?
certainly.  tell me, bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
spanish.
did you say rape her?
alright, i'm coming...hold on.
i can't go back to jail.  i gotta get out of here.
i would, if you really ever wanted to know.
ok. it's apartment 1009, south tower, starliner towers. may as well go there directly.
no...you idiot!
but, madame! if you don't think about food what do you think about?
how's that again?
look -- elaine robinson and i do not get along.
okay.  you win.  'dirty harry' coming up.
they'll be here.  don't worry.  my men are picking them up.
ti-misery?  what's that?
well... you can only hear that richard gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
huh?
so you're going to kill her?  put the gun down claire.
the only things missing were some halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. what does that sound like to you?
you're the one who wanted to drive fast.
was there any damage?
you'll die if you leave here.
the good stuff.
you get your first palm tree in south carolina.
they don't have to feel like slaves.
the material world is an illusion. it doesn't matter if they're there or not. the world is in my head.
i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
no! she has seen too much. she knows too much.
five times.
it always is.
like me.
i don't give a damn.
you shut up you, fuckin' retard. get your shit and get out of here.  that was a wake-up slap, frank. remember. reality, like i said. don't forget any bit of what i said to you and we'll be fine.
okay lloyd. first, no way does frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? third, she's the one in danger. she's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. fourth, i look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  i'm gonna put you on hold -- doc you still there?
i still don't know what you're talkin' about.
couple hundred on his person. those hombres would've taken the stash.
whoopie fucking doo.
baby laxative? we can't snort baby laxative.
i don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
no.  just you.
she never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
in portugal, yes.
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n.
well, you shouldn't drink. are you gonna drink?
hh-uh. last time i saw it was...
you and mr. sholes seem to be implying as much.
that's their job, isn't it?  to argue.  so, i think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
and what is that?
i guess so.
but i...
no.
i don't know; i really don't. the last time i saw it was when i was in washington. i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re- elect the president. how it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
...you gonna kill me?
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
do it, or look for another profession.  that's a choice i guess.
i saw him walk you home.
this is a travesty.  a debacle.
here, tin man -- help me.
yeah.
why, yes, of course ... but for the moment, let's be satisfied with algiers! in the mountains our work is always easier.
there's one thing i have to say.  i'm going away.
i don't care what you believe. i saved your life once, i don't plan on making a habit of it. you want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. if you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. people breed like chickens.
yeah. i guess you could call it that.
stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- dead man! dead man walking!!
nothing.
i figured you already heard.
happy for him.  and relieved.
i told you she was innocent.
yeah, so where is he?
you'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  cole younger's going to make everybody rich!
int. darlene's store - night.
so mr. mcallister asked you to run.
yes.
you want me to tell you it's your fault? it probably is. what are you going to do about it?  i thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
alan-one. he calls me... may i pass?
whatever.
seven-fifty.
no more, man.
taken care of.
i vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called norton.
that's what i figured, too.
i'll get your back.
what the hell is going on?!
pride will do.
exactly. i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. she won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
don't worry about it.  but as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. huh?
that's the problem. he did.
are you mad?  with all this unrest the colosseum will be open day and night!  anyway, i'm not political, i'm in the entertainment business.
pffft!  absolute nonsense.  the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear mr. garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  as you well know.
i seem to remember knocking on your door.
yes or no.
get the fuck outta my chair.
such as?...
shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
i have.
no, did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?
it must have been some other gate.
and you, there are many places to get away. why here?
i won't be late.
that's why i'm calling, miss price...
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
these? what are these? they're swords.
what do you mean?
it's me, chief.  can you talk?
...i know.
i told you, i'm not going back.
where are you going? wait!
seems like it.
sure.
i wouldn't say that. but at least you've put the camera to good use.
it is.
go to transportation, get a ticket.
ah!  the lady is armed.
you're not fooling anyone you know.  isn't there anything you could do?
it's no problem. anyway, i have some stuff i need to --
he didn't say, sir. i told him i didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
of course i can. i love you.
'cos i know you wear purple underwear.
it's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  not seven like they said.
don't cut me.
patrick?
i plan on liquidating almost evetything.
we split that.
hold on.
fuck no.
there stands the loins from which you've sprung.
or a vegetarian?
the staff, the guests.
-- you've got to listen to me. do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. isn't that true, louis?
huh?
bertrand, sire.
in her dreams.
vada, just put 'em on the stool.
oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
there's no *real* ship as can match the interceptor.
ya hear, joey? she thinks this face is cute? hey, whatcha doin' now? you wanna go for a ride?
i don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
you old devil. well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
hey, ben. thanks for coming down.
jake. you can call me jake. here and there.
the guy i told you about - aaron...?  he says i can learn to control them. that i could lose the gloves at some point.
i'm happy, miss flaemm.
gotcha.  we've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
five ten. brown eyes. but you're no pinup.
oh, god... kyle.  i need you so much.
you don't get rain like you used to in england. a good shower that's the ticket. stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
nobody lives forever, boy. who'd want to?
yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
oh ma, they're not using me. it's just a chance to travel, see things. besides, it's the only way i can get to new york.
edie— it's—
no. thanks. gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
oh, right.
i ain't in a hurry.
i like the sport the way it is.
good-bye!
gabe!?
do you enjoy it?
yes, you could. cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. marry me.
yes, sir, i think they maybe. i think "jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
yah, but i - okay, i would, i'd guarantee ya your money back.
he's a lucky man.  do i know him?
i don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
backward.
paul rusesabagina, mr. godefroid. the house manager. i met you on your last visit.
leave the light off.
oh je -- couldn't he sleep with rita? we'11 all have a good time.
but i want you to do it, i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody i can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
great.  first i have a birthright, now i've got a fate.  hey, do i have to take notes on this?
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
how's the ice?
there was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister. across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. a unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' laz, there. he the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
of course.  what are you suggesting?
...yah, well, you stay away from scotty now -
thank you, mr. murphy. we'll let you know.
i'll call it... tails.
you're a great architect, albert.
-- 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and i knew --
yul brynner. they're all dead.
what shape i take matters not.  long you for another?  i'll give you your heart's desire.
he should turn that music down. jeremiah's gonna kill him.
i consider them linked.
mickey told him to call.  'he's some very hotshot surgeon at mass. commonwealth.  he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye.  you meet him at the hospital.'
mmm, i never get upset over that. mmm?
let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
alright. you want some pie?
lara, please...
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking. agreed. send ngabo. is that all?
i've got three big ones.
no!
how do you do, sir?
they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  it's like cracking a computer.  all it takes is time.
motherfuck a window, radio raheem is dead.
and ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
like i had a choice with that anal-retentive jon archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  at least he took an interest. you took off without leaving so much as a post-it.
yes.  tell me.
i'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. that ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  it's just a scared little baby, sherm.
because we're being hunted.  from the bushes straight ahead.
we've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  you go get help. i'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor.
remember one thing.
let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
thanks marv, i'll make it good to you.  you know what my dream is? one day to be on the other end of that phone...
o, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
and what does jennifer think's real?
then what was it?
rudy. how'd you know my name?
it's ready now, i know it is.
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
i told you, george. i'm not going.
i don't think she knows.
maybe not. but there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  i heard you ask your wife, "who's that? his grandfather?"
look ... where's this going? what do you want me to do?
what?
atta, boy!
as brave as my father. as wise.
will it help to get you out?
no, i'm afraid i never had the pleasure of meeting the general. this sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
she's a treasure she is.
yeah.
she's driving me fuckin' crazy.
i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.
yeah, mick.  i've got the money. i'm staring right at it.
conscience... .  i didn't even know i had one until i met you and edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
do you have visual?
okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...
don't worry. if i can't handle it, i'll just kill everybody.
not yet.
yah!
giovanni, i want to thank you.
pass.
is that the queen's request?
yeah...
good boy.
six, six, six, pick up sticks.
tell me about it.
don't tell me what to do.
it insults maria. slip it to the dog if you have to... do you mind if i talk to you for a moment?
we toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
thanks, valentine ...
you tol me you wuunt ask me again til i'm ready....
jesus christ ...
he's hot.
it's not.
we don't have time for hysterics.
i'm only telling you what i've heard...  haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was like...?
negative, on surface... a manufactured object.
he's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
i bet.
so, i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. would you describe tim that way, grace?
because... i didn't think i would?
why?
no, man, nothing is fucked here--
oh, shit.
an hour ago. <i></i> i tried to prepare myself, but i didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. i can't even bear to look at him... how about you? you're okay?
twenty-four minutes.
you got me, commander.
if we ever get to it.
got it.
what'd you give for that thing?
great!  bring 'em in!  bunny, i gotta run.
but they caught the guy.  i heard it all.  sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  shooting anybody.  drugs, probably.
no, baby!
well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
but it's a small room, jason.
you will? for sure?
the hotel guy?  it's been in the papers lately.  his kids are all suing each other over his estate. he was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  somebody took something didn't belong to them!
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
no, i'm serious.
it's possible.  why?
oh, yeh.  but this is nine year ago, i had my healt, i wasn't wantin' to sell.
we know, but our man says no way on the dope. this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next' day. they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
... this doing hair it's...
i'm afraid i can't do that, mr. daglish.
what's the point?  it's going down.
...among others.
what?
you realize what is at stake?
she works hard.
c of e, sir.
our what?
i want to, bembry, but i can't.
the cartoon?
i know -- i know.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. if it weren't for birds...
you missed a fucking sale.  big deal.  a deadbeat polack.  big deal. how you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
fine.
i'm inviting you. i mean if you're not located, i got a place. i'm inviting you, goddamit.
the senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
went with bobby.
damn right, and you can start by taking rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
what's it say?
it can't be helped. this is lucy.  you know -- like "lucy in the sky with diamonds."
i know the difference.  you were in lompoc usp, the federal penitentiary. i've delivered people there.  so basically you've spent half your life in prison.
i gotta protect the canadian horder,
what does he want from you?
to do right. isn't that why you're doing it?
livingston, huh?
just give him a couple of months. a girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
yeah, how'd it go with sportboy?
there aren't enough arrows.
he won't neither. he never has.
maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but i've got to try.
what do you need?
let me heal you, baby.
okay, tracy, so who do you think did it?  whom should we "interrogate?"
i need your help.
--what the hell are you talking about?!
wearing them?  or humping them?
what are you going to do, v?  shoot me?  kill me in cold blood?  i don't think so.  i'll tell you why.  if you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  if i was you, i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home.  but you didn't and i know why, because you don't want to kill me.  do you, v?  do you? no, i know you don't.
can you tell me about it?
whah?
hello, hal.
louise, i'll do anything.  i know what's makin' you run.  i know what happened to you in texas.
i'd taken the mask?
told what?
no we're not.
hyperdrive.
i know, i know. perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. and zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
it is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. i hope you will forgive me. i know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. don't you recognize me? i am the duchess swana.
you sayin' you'll do what?
i'm not sure that's possible.
i don't know if i want to stay here. i don't feel safe.
where do you think, my idiot friend? we're in a nice filthy cemetery. does this make you happy? is this fitting and proper enough?
damn travel agency.  that kremlin thing is in moscow, isn't it?
it's on west broadway. we can walk.
she stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. a real skunk.
dyson.
try an angel.
thoreau with a lawnmower.
it's not ours to decide. all that live must die. it's god's will.
righty, right. the doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
oh! the virgin has spoken! sarah stop it!
oh, that'll be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.  'lo, earl. how are you feeling?
that would have kept you out of the magic circle.  which was presumably the idea.  these are about nix.
i shouldn't have to, audrey. you're supposed to be my friend. i trusted you.
we're late to get to your mother.
i'm calling in sick.
that is what i said, doctor.
look at the collar on that coat...
you son—of—a—bitch. how could you let them put the implant in my head? how?
let's just do it and get out of here.
i know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
yo, everyone check this out. hey, what's the da vinci virus?
--followin' miss susan fass-pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
not at all, governor.  very striking.
i can't hardly believe it.  it's working out just like you said, wyatt.  we're lootin' this burg six ways through sunday.
nothing.  i just came in for a steam.
when was that?
american cheese. the king of road food.
just follow me.
shove it, ralph!
absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
maybe. recognize this?
divide and conquer.
muley! where's my folks, muley?
fucking a, my friend.
now wait a minute, gerry--
we were at her door.  i was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the queen mother.
well, i'll ask him, but i don't think he'll be very keen. he's already got one, you see?
we never went to bed together.
naturally.  are you claiming, mr. garrison, that mr. oswald also had dinner with me?
i want you to come.
sometimes we sell them to mcdonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
jake, what is it?
don't worry, mom. just go, you'll miss your flight.
james looks twice?
with the emphasis on self, and in selfish, right?
you never really trusted me.
come here.
you mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
i stopped drinking.  i gave up drugs.  and i'm meditating three hours a day.  it's the center of my life...
-- i guess you haven't.
...i don't know... it's true he touches me. i love him.
groovy. smashing! good on ya!  nice tie. yea capitalism!
you did?

i wasn't sure you caught that.
ja -- ja! droppen sie dead! always mit the jokes! droppen sie dead!
looking for him for what?
right, of course, the company... but you see, i've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
she's not in love with him -- or any of them.
what will they tell you?
so man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
see ya downstairs.
colonel harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
well here i am.
nah.
don't touch me!  i'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
i think you're homesick.  i'll be out at my camp over the weekend. nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  john, i'll be back here again thursday; i'll be in touch. lieutenant, thank you.
oh.
this was nothing like warsaw.  i held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have.
fine, just stay out of my way.  hit it.
think about it.
that's the problem with this case. everyone thinks they know jason's life story. but they don't. what you're remembering is a _movie_. fiction.	in the movie, jason's mother runs around, killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something besides write?
what are you talking about?  it’s me, jack campbell.  penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper!
here it is.  a bird on one side. his cage on the other.  now, stare at it.  the bird seems to be in his cage.
"fuck the machine"? "fuck the machine"?  what is this.  courtesy class...?  you're fucked, rick--are you fucking nuts?  you're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  you want to...
he never came home. but i'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- so after a couple hours i think, "what am i doing here? nineteen years of this shit? so i made up my mind, that's it.
no, thank you.  i'll walk.
for them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
you're not.  where is it?
what are you talking about?
so we've got problems.  everybody's got problems--that's normal--
he's free. his time's up. that's the rules. he's been treated and reevaluated. he doesn't show any signs any more.
can't you get him?
for the third time, yes.
don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
where are we? we're on the street. we're walking down the street. we're talking to ourselves. people are staring at us.
about who?
it's great.  i swea-- i'm-- i'm, tch, i'm speechless.  i was...i was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  i don't know what to say.  i'm moved and i laughed and i-- uh, i, you know, i was on the edge of my seat.  i just think it's wonderful! i'm, i'm totally...stunned.  this is not an insult.  i'm amazed that you can...  it was-- i just thought it was great.
get over what? i don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody i know.
of course not, that swedish thief! he's a thief of hearts!  i love you, gabrielle.
don't worry, willow.  she's in good hands.  you haven't made a mistake.

wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
daddy, why can't i...?
now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. i have ten minutes left.
they're dead, aren't they?
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  that's right.  but you can't remember going inside, can you?  no, of course not.  harry couldn't either, could he?  "like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. i think she was crying...
good.   i'm good.
but you know, that was just a dream.  doesn't really count.
i'm having dinner with w...
yeah.  i meant... you know what i'm going to do with it?  i'm going to buy a sixty- three 'vette stingray.  all tricked out and cherry.  i'm going to be so sweet.

finn ...

so you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  everybody likes me!
i'm out of here, man!  are you coming?
all right - i've seen enough!
they said you were drunk.  why don't you tell her the truth?
uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
nope. never been.
it wasn't me.
or maybe you just think you do. just another small town. one guy chasing you. you go big town. just gonna have four guys after you instead. kiss kissy kiss. it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
he's yours but i take him in!  i'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but i'm walkin' him in.
that's him.
sheriff? i'm doctor sam loomis.

excellent. i'll go down with you.
he's a member of our congregation.
where do you live?
i understand.
i was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and lieutenant singh…
that little black line means death for this infant.  the fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  the baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. it'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
of course. i'll get a car to drive you.
it's pretty.
yes.  the cops.  no.
prayin', brother. prayin'.
because i wasn't worthy.
missed you at church this morning, jeremiah.
agents.
that you overreacted.  that you lost it.  not me.  it was your mistake.
no! stay where you are. i mean it. i'll let go.
that's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
this is it?  i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks.  sarah, please don't bounce that here.
maybe we should split it up now.
never.
we'd better get everybody online.  and kyle, stop downloading porn.  your frame rate is unacceptable.
well, lemme sing the one i picked an' see what you think...  "when there's a fire in your heart/break the glass/sound the alarm..."
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
why?
like tonight.
he's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. hell, i seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. he kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. if you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england?
i'm tired.  i need to rest.
well, you're lucky it's not you.
'code blue'...
we've only got one suit.
you don't like my costume? cool. i'll go with plan b. which one you like better?
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
sweet princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
i will seek the fortress for you.
i have nothing to hide.
i can't clean anything.  the vacuum is out in the garage.  i can't leave the house.  why don't they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
it's just that sometimes i wonder what team i'm playin' on.
but you're only a mud carrier.
........... it's a bomb isn't it?
i don't know him. is he a nice guy? you think he'll help me out?
how are you?
wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the international house of pancakes in about five minutes !
i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
i'd throw everything away for you.
rifle?
and i said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
well, what's nice about her? tell us!
so i'll get a fair shot?
i love you. i want to have your baby.
then you saw him, too?
all right, you get out of here, man!
let him trust quintus.
ok.  that's why.  i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla. your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
i peeked.
what do you fear?
neil's still having a bad time at school.  i feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
what should they be looking for?
he's so dreamy.  he's like... a greek god.  he's the cutest guy here.    he's boss.  he's fab.  he's...
i've gotta give her some pills. percodan, she ran out.
ms. marr!
i'm not really sure - working, i guess...
i don't want to understand it. this isn't one of your science projects. i just want to fix it. fast!
no.
you sure do.
he wants to see us now.
i ain't no good at it. i just come by.
i'm cool -
no, don't say anything else!
yeah.
in the kitchen.

yeah--that's right. diz--
oh really? well, i'll just let you get back to little ms. hot panties.

i came for love. my fiancé is here.

sherry, this...
i like it up here.
no blood. as i left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. i went to her house. she has the little girls. they are safe.
it's simple.  what was your pal louis' first musical instrument?
no juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. but we might be able to adapt --
red, i found something --
i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come.
i'm not suffering, you know. i don't give a shit.
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods.
strong is vader.  clouded is your fate.  mind what you have learned ... notice everything, everything!  it can save you.

you could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.

the way you just looked at me...
an old woman and her grandson.
in a few minutes there will be no doll. there can't be.  i'm sorry.
we can explain, colonel.
come on, shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
forget it, venkman.  you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  now it's my turn, smart-ass.
max... what are you talking about?
you know, lula, i never told you what all i was doin' before i met you.
how do you mean?                                            ]

i mean it, let's get away from here, first joey then nolan, now charley— and any minute... .  ...i'm frightened— i'm frightened.
but she'll have no one to look after her!
don't be sorry. you're not taking it.
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
just kiss me.  it would mean such a lot to me.
but you'll die.  you'll squash yourself.  what's the point?
you can't say *that* to--
yes!  it was...it was unforgettable.
'start-up not 50 miles from here. kid's on prozac.
i intend no slight to you, but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is.  i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury.
excellent. see. who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? well, it's been grand. sorry you all have to die now.
brad. i don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
okay.  okay.  the <u>suitcase</u> bomb...
just the way the world works.  look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know.
you seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until i'm better.  that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
you must take your own life now, david, before it's too late.
it sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. and since all it is is a drop, the welshman's got nothing at stake. i say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. it'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. but he's got it, captain.
thank you.  how's the spotted one's milk?
you're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
easy sketchy.
was i?
there is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
i don't know.  i don't think there's any one person.  see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  it's very organized.
who?
i can't help you.  no one can.  the precogs are never wrong.
satellites?
that's right i did, didn't i?
well, you're a tower of support.
to lunch.
commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? these were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
aw, forget it.
we'll see.  let's try clark.
you want some water or something?
shut up.  cuff him to the rail.
i don't get you. even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
no. please, monsieur, it is a little game we play. they put it on the bill, i tear the bill up. it is very convenient.
i don't know what you're talking about.  who told you that?
don't let him do that.
look!  sarah!
what?
i'll just never learn arithmetic.
that's very thoughtful, honey. it's just a slump. things will pick up.
so what do you think?
what?
well--he calls it the bermuda triangle.  he said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
binding you.
o.k.! send that!
damn straight...  let's go check out these paper panthers.
no.  richard talked to his parents.
500... year's wages.  and i never even saw a horse like that.
i need to speak to you, mr. d'amour.  about last night.
do you still ride?
let me borrow your car.
she needs to be alone, i think.
it's not right.
"angel!"  i didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  listen, here's the thing, i gotta get over there to the tv station to collect my million bucks.
what's happening?
god, you... you're mean.
i'm going to need some blood.  it must be from a woman.
aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as mr. and mrs. stew smith. how do you like that?
i'm waiting for the phone.
yes, i believe so.
thank you.
with those camera lights and...
we need to talk.
you retired, too?
thanks. nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. oh, it's been a lot of fun.
i don't have the money for those bourgeois traps. hell, i'm making what a czech earns.
why do they tell little kids that?
that's right.
i'll throw this out. precautionary measure.
oh my god.
right here, baby.  right here.
did you hear what he sang?
all stop on the engine.
sorry, sir.  uh... here's what we got.
i've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
she <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. was her...
speak up in donovan's class. he likes people with an opinion. sit in the back for royalton. he tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
why a beret?
you're fucking desperate.
hello, miss wells.
is he in the bathroom?
you run the job, but i run the show. you got two weeks to set it up.
it's not really--
you go out in the woods and shoot targets -- whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
sure, they'd turn him down. he ought to know that. i'm going in there and talk to him.
yes? oh, hello -- sure i got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
the right side of the engine is running richer than the left. and the scope isn't showing shit... i dunno...
why do you need that?
... looks like a convention.
honey, i have to ask you this... is santos involved in any of this?
i see...  ... and you are really a gardener, aren't you?
very well.  if you tell me not to worry, i shan't.
...it's on.
i was afraid you weren't gonna come. we haven't got much time.
no, i'm awake. what's the matter?
to invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the doctors.
we'll figure something out.
burbage, i will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
i'm not as tough as you think i am.
look, i'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a saturday night. this isn't about fun. i'm working here.
you're horrible
thanks for helping.
there's something going on, z --

you don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  you do it by instinct.  think like him.  do what has to be dane.
okay.
...check...?
there's been a break in.  lock this door and stay here.  don't move a muscle.
last one down springs for room service.
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
where are you going...?  this is me...this is ricky, jim.  jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  you understand?  this is me.  something upset you.  sit down, now sit down.  you tell me what it is.  am i going to help you fix it? you're goddamned right i am.  sit down.  tell you something...? sometimes we need someone from outside.  it's...no, sit down...now talk to me.
i never thought he'd do it.
relax. it will be fine.
no, thanks.
tell him he can keep them. the bellboy looks puzzled.
because that's the kind of man bill parrish is.
i think i will disappoint you.
you don't have to come here.
dear, i was thinking.  why don't we go to paris next year?  i've never been.  your father, god bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
just warmin' up.
i haven't forced him to work.  i only wet him down once.  why would he leave?
they, uh, they got to my witness.
chicken salad, devra!
yes, it was about 11 in the morning. i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass, in a rented car - a blue valiant.  i'll never forget that day.
normally, i'd say no.  everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  makes sense.  but what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
yes.
vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
oh, seth, how can i ever make it up to you?
doug...
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
what the hell is that?
i'm sorry if i caught you at a bad time.
we sell it.  i got it all figured out. we make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  we move all of it.  we've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  or a lot of weed for our head.  what do you think?  not bad, huh?  i got the baggies and everything.
bonds, sir?
you asked me to model.  remember?
see, the thing is, i heard a rumor that this guy i like was gonna ask me.
willy -- hit the lights.

marlowe? oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

you got a pretty house, miss johnson!
goddamn!  viking bob!  mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
without the body we have no physical proof. we need a confession.
no. but you will.  it's very important that you live.
so, i met a new friend.
it's the only way.
yeah, and i could've used the sleep. i'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
well i guess i probably heard you call him that.
i drove to st. cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound. and i wound up staying for a couple of hours.
i don't think we'll go to war.  we shouldn't even be here.  this isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  it should be decided regionally.
i insist. it's delicious. just a taste.
some guys never get it back.
then it's going to happen.  the world's going to end.  -- and you've always known.
wait a minute. this is the left one. he walks bad enough already.

no punch line.  maybe i was just admiring your know-how---yours and falco's.
i don't remember.  is that what you wanted to ask me?
yes.  yes, come with me!
shhh... i really need to get some sleep.
that's on us.

gary's not into fiber optics. he's betting everything on the satellites.
i'll be around.
oh, shut up, buddy.
-- a speed manufacturer --
it's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics?
some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
wouldn't blame him if he was.
you'll never get away with it, miss andrews. your father'll stop you before you get half way to new york.
oh, nice.
they must be broken. i'm hanging in my straps! we're inverted!
nooo!
you're too quick for me.
i'm sorry, that dress.  what do you say we...
we keep it quiet. it's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. not with the press around.
bug batteries... according to military intelligence, it'll be random and light. drop status ?
i didn't hide it. i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.

i can't.
take off your coat.
well, it's a little too early. i'd say thursday would be good. i'll know by then. is that all right?
it was probably luck- i'd rather you did the shooting.
and they were usually right.
you know i do.
i don't know.
or you will do what, mrs. marshall?  but i admire your courage. your husband, on the other hand...
kill them.  of course.  but why stop there?  why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
name one.
just now.
rake her.
with all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  who needs cops when you've got gizmos.

and maybe pass arbogast on the road?  thanks.
yes, i believe he did.
what's being photographed?
right.  i love you, frank.
maybe he never came in.  if he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  maybe he's outside.
can't remember shit. crs.
i understand. tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
how are you, carl ?
that's stupid! i happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
in these woods you are a commoner. now be quiet.  true royalty approaches.
no, it doesn't... just kiss me.

i'll be all right. you just do as i say.
ibanez...let's go !
--vanished.

you did. joe no i didn't. you said   something first.
well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. when they flood the house. that like... destruction is a form of creation. so the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  they want to change things.

my job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
yeah. he finally agreed to let us have a room.
what? a swallow carrying a coconut?
no.  if i moved out now i'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  i'm not ready to do that.
you've never seen her run.
no.  something honest.
oh... god... am i cold...
so what do you think?  should we get a room?
like it never happened...
oh, they'll come.  i'll have guild issue the invitations. 
maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. i could get her a pair of earrings or something.
did you see who posted it?
i've discovered something about lindenmeyer'5 maestro teaching tool i thought you should know...  the harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
if that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  i'll be okay.
lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. your business here is very much finished. you're still here because of natalie.
of course.
doesn't matter....
that's just it. i didn't think. i just did it.
well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, i'm, like, a comedian-
i care for you, too. but you'll be around, don't say that.
damn... alright then.
byzantine?
what the fuck are you talking about?
here and there. restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.
they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
ouch....the lunchtime poll. so what's the question?
none.  call it a hunch.
yah?
she married a hockey player.
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? i don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
about four years ago...at crystal lake. i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school.
telling when people have done something wrong?
that's a lot of those.
car clean? plenty of gas?
that is correct.
did you ever work with her?
then you went freelance?
oh, jesus, get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  this man is having a heart attack.
just stop it.  don't say another word like that.
we coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.

tripp, where the hell...
it looks real. i don't know anything about guns.
not true.  shall i tell you what you were thinking?  you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt.
what do you mean?
do you want me to stop calling?
i'll look out for myself! ... now go away -- leave me alone.
we need blood.  to nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
annette?
put the sense/net police on it. the matrix is their turf.
ok, then.  keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
really?
lao she.
what if i told you he did this to me?
he put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  and if you know beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. and if you know that, you know beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the federal government everything they want to know about my ass. now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. and you best believe it ain't gonna be me. you know what i'm sayin'? you gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. i got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in cabo san lucas. me and mr. walker make us one more delivery, i'm gonna have me over a million. you think i'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? shit, you better think again. 'fore i let this deal get fucked up, i'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  understand what i'm sayin'?
eh, if the bootie fits...
we're almost home, you and me.  keep your shit together.  this isn't l.a.
exactly --
sure.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
...what a world.
the feeb gig was i front a coupla undercover, russian-speakers to them.  one's atf.  and broker the deal.  set up the meet with the nlr types...
great!  because, otherwise i'll erase your ass.
part of him. painless is the owner and operator of the pride of hamtrack. that's where he comes from... hamtrack, michigan.
oh i thought i'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. or set the house on fire. you know.
you'll know everything in a minute. get the champagne.
he left us at dawn.
well, i'll be damned if i <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  you know what the worst word is, in the english language?  it's ïretirement."  what the <u>hell</u> was i thinking of?  hell, i used to...
thanks, basil. maybe the nineties aren't so bad after all.
i don't give a shit about-
i hate him so much sometimes, stephen. you don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
maroon.  i stole it.
yeah. you got the whole story just right.
i ain't hitting a man first.
sentimental fellow, aren't you?
yes you are. you always do. it's why we broke up. you always hide behind him.
we have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and i chose my mother. she was born in los angeles and since my uncle phil moved out here i came in to visit him and then i looked at her high school yearbook and...  and i called a few people and one guy said that she went to ucla, another guy said that i should call hillary mitchell so....
what do you want me to do, zoe? i'll do whatever you want.
you know that chick?
oh! i'll pop them in a bowl.
fenster and hockney?
you didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
it could have been - fifteen years ago. it's my part now.
you only pay me two-fifty a week.  i owe you fifty bucks.
you want to know what you are doing here?! you are love pumping. you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. you are walking the walk. this is it fisher, the real stuff. you love this woman. love is second to nothing. i love you. i love moore. i love micheal. this car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. nothing. we will do what it takes. whatever it takes.
who?
what is it, noontime?
fine. you get back to chatting with your precious customers.
whoa.  remind me.
well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
where is rick?
animal! animal! wake up!
that doesn't mean you do. you can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
there's got to be another way out.
he was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since i was young.
find out what's holding things up. i want to get the hell off this farm.
sewing mailbags?  me?  never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. wasn't about to start when i was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
we've got time. we've got a lot of time. i can help you.
no.
no, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. the first is get that halfback out of the game. he had one year with the rams before the army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
no. and you have to be.
i know we are. but as the years go by, we become even worse. isn't that so, corrado?
because i'm sick and tired of her little games.  because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. because i've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
i was seeing aaron and there were some ... complications.
no more waiting in coffee shops ...i promise.
said he's not an actor.
no.  not our johnny.  i mean, it's johnny...but not now...in the future.
duty calls!
what is wrong with you?
rosa, i can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
a tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  they say it looks prehistoric.  like maybe a dinosaur.
why don't you?
to fly jets. to be the fastest motherfucker in the world. you gotta come and visit me. i'm only a couple hours away.
those girls drove off because of you.
i was gonna call that girl from last night. take her to a movie tonight.
yes, sir.
i don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
old don quixote--man of the people smith--
you're fucked up, lila.  why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? figure it out for chrissake.
mr. rose, i'm in the *doctor* business.  if you want, i can help you. you don't have to go anywhere.
the bogyman!
i'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
thank you, mothershead. have a porter put them in my office.
...barton, is everything okay?
you're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? she's ly-ing.
no, and we got four of 'em.
i got vincennes in the next room. it's not a good week for cops in general.
all men are cheats.
level 2.  galleria.
please!
yes.
what's that, not great?
fine. together again, huh?
i need to whizz.
pizza planet!  yeah!!!
and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami, ft. worth, and memphis.
something i want?
all my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  we did have a lot of laughs together, penelope.
that's right. what are you doing in bodega bay?
who?
i don't know. perhaps he met somebody.
you know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  we're still open.
it is to me.  that's why i came to this house.  that's why i took this job -- ghost writing!
i'm going to win this case...mist...mr. doneghy...i'm going to the jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and i'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
maybe.
power levels quite low, sir.
oh.
sure.
mr. harris, we have fax for you!
that.  and.  annabelle is over her head.  with brad 'the dreamboat' kovitsky.
my mom? don't call my mom.
no.
i was interested in two things: computers and crime. they sort of came together.
you get the christ out! you dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! i don't have to show you anything; you get out!
two, please.
it's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  anywhere else i'd be an interesting little number, here i'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one.  sag meaning screen actor's guild.
you're good.
good. thank you.
get away --
we don't seem to be communicating--
i'm dizzy, not deaf.
as far as we know, nothing.
good.   i have a job for you in america.
how many?
somebody's come. already.
what do i have to do to get a straight answer around here.
yes, i do.
not really, no.
and this has what to do with me?
can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
they will.  they w-w-will.
older.
where?
if you want me to.
why would he ? his parents are rich.
i'm fine, sir.
yeah.
rowan.
i do?
no, no, it's just --
enough.
we'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making agent orange.
maxie says he runs a tight ship. i wouldn't fuck with him.
don't you want to know...? i bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
you shouldn't have gotten out of bed, miss.
give me that again!
hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu, i'd tell her to go fuck herself.  why can't she board it?
i'm sorry, stanley.
those are my letters!
well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
thank you!
did you get the case for the securities?
what does that mean?
where the guy jumped and you almost fell. no, you never told me that story.
sir, that's not true! i love my country!
the address of the n.e.p.h. and w. why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
i found it! i found it!
you know wilmont?
to learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet. that is the programming.
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
oh. well, then he's a truthful whitefoot, of course.
thank you.
so i hear. you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, i understand.
ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. i can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  i will not  be known only for my failures.  and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  you're too smart.  you'e too proud.  dr. malcolm.  please.  this is a chance at redemption.  for both of us. there's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
i'm sorry. i'm sorry i forgot the tent. i don't think i forgot anything else.
this is his first night on earth.  he wants to close the door behind him. like all lieutenants, he covets command. there's a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back.  he has to destroy it.
you can't just stay out half the night and carry on, jeffrey. there's got to be some order, jeffrey. i thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
think of what?  we're fucked.
then why?
what are you?
lemme see the map.
then how'd i get here?
give us a chance, dad!
when do you think it got to him?
i don't know. you- it's like you're- you're removed.
yeah, speak for yourself.
neither will the public.  the media has caught wind of his pardon. unless mr. barnes starts giving me some tangible results, i'm going to put him back in his cage.
chief, here's a little secret. drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. now shit or get off the pot. do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers?
listen, kicks, you'll never guess what i've cooked up this tine...
umm- i don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
that's true.
it's jungle rot!  this room is making everybody sick!  this is your family doctor speaking now.  here--i brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
wade. i thought she was alright. till this morning she was.
but han and leia will surely die.
no more about beynon.
we'll see.
goddamn you!
you can't just walk off onna girl like that.
you fit the profile, brother. you look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
maybe it's an exercise.
don't... talk crazy.
how many do you think they've killed?
what the hell's a freeway?
do you still talk to sylvan?
you want a confession? why don't you confess, bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
hi, thorn.
hell no. besides i'm just a radio call away if something happens. i feel i should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
there was this one fella.  asked a lot of questions.  i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
well -- i could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
any of them richard long?
i know that, lois. and i wish he were here . . .
he's a fisherman! the most overrated writer of the century. i mean, he's the perfect american author — fat, violent, drunk...
you didn't say that about the food?
we'll be all right...  we will...
no, i don't mean the thumbs. you already told me about the thumbs.
we'll just put up the top.
that's a little vague, spock -
jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? there's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
yeah. she's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
frank.  fuck it.  okay?
what's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
are they sure it's a meteor?  it didn't come down like one.
what i need, i can't get from doctor crusher...  counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
that's a big question.
i'm doin' business here!
don't kid yourself. that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. he's watching us like a hawk.
absolutely, sir. as a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
well i mean it this time.  come on.  let's get this over with!
no idea.  we have no surface support. it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
so? you're already late. a few more minutes won't matter.
there's an old fudgesicle over there. you want it?
the down drafts would wipe her out.  it's the only chopper.  if it goes, you got no ride out.
no! it can't be!
hurry back.
i see it. i don't get it.
stay here. if you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
it was just an idea.
who is this madame sconce? let's find her and talk to her.
yes, madame. you see, i have to get up very early.  my little brother goes to school--  you see, mother is dead.
a joke is a story with a humorous climax.
now:  the waterford merchant's association, of who i am council...
what makes you think you're so almighty? telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
i lugged it all over town!
right, agent cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  he didn't call?
stay right there...
but we made a deal.
you build it!
--personal rivalry? i'm not getting back at you.
go to hell.
you're crazy.
yeah...
who gave you this idea? what is responsible for all this?
what are you talking about?
yes --
aw, that's all right.
thank you.
watch your altitude, striker. it's too erratic. you can't come straight in. you've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. you've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
that's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
the singleman party, sir?
taylor! may i ask what *taylor* has to do with it?
yeah, okay. just gimme a minute to freshen up.
no, mr. powers, i expect them to die. even after they pay me the money, i'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  all right, guard, begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.
that fool. that damn fool.
i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
and please don't call her my mother.
i'm issuing you a ticket. moving violation.
...asshole.
miss schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector... you may as well help us. in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. tell me where lime is.
i said i wish i'd never been born.
i never notice the view after the first week.
you're there.
you don't take 'em off, i'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
you got me.
you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
hey, i have an idea...
i'll even give you a warm up question.
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
the crash davis. ) and you, larry hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the texas league when you were pitching for el paso and i was hitting cleanup for shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and i tattooed it over the goodyear tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and i got a free wheel alignment from goodyear.
tomorrow?
good evening, mr. blaine.

she was a crossbreed, chinese and polish.
i'm afraid so, mister presient. being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction. in 45 minutes.
sounds, voices, music, humming. all of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
maybe.
i dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. man, i really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of petticoat junction, man.
in what sense?
you'd take a polygraph on it?
you need a doctor.
eh.  if i ever get out from under. maybe take may to france or somethin'.
mom, look, don't say anything. first of all, i'm not pregnant.
they came back?
kramer...
why?
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
...push this? oh. it's working. hello, martin?
friend of yours? did you help him out of a bind?
i think it's too late for changes, michael.  i promised myself i wouldn't talk about it and i've gone and spoiled it.
i was wrong.
they're... not here anymore.
harry, i really think she.....
hmm.
i'll try to keep him as far away from it as i can...
first oboe.
that's right, just me.
not too late.
... for the mermaids.
that's ridiculous.
moneypenny! how indiscreet! have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
i hate this city.
i know. i wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
so what should i do?  call the police? you think they'll believe me?
has ray come in yet?
although mr. huntington makes an excellent point, i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
just a few days.
i don't want to talk about it.
well, there aren't too many other fellas i'd do it for...
oh, right.  the guy flipped out or something?  killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
i told you, he's got the gift.  same with music. hears it once and he's got it.
gee, honey-bunch, i'm sorry -- i'm going to have to disappoint you.
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
did you just hear something?
i never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. the whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
but you didn't.  why not?
oh, absolutely, but trubshaw's a man worth meeting. no point setting out half shod.
is there something i can do to help you?
interesting choice of words. i don't remember. i just know that i want to.
great...
part of what?
three days? we could kill 'em tomorrow.
good, because it cost enough.  there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
sorry to barge in on you. anybody else here besides you two?
a two-penny mauritius -- issued in 1856. not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
all right. let me out.
a message from citizen fouche.
excuse me?
you don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  if it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a continuing criminal enterprise.
yes, i do.
i'll buy that. black's always good.
all right -- but listen to me. what happened was there was this party at my parents. i drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
i don't want a million - i just want one.  a perfect one.
leave me alone!!
i want to know what's going on.  are you part of this?
stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
no.
give me some?
no.
who brought you here?
i want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. that's all i've ever wanted.
make it so.
oh.
i don't want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? i don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
it's okay, i got lots more.
it never is.
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. it might attract the police.
well, sir, i putter.
man, you're livin' dangerously. let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
yes. good was done this .....
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur?
i hope so.
come on, phil, don't jerk me around.
you're supposed to be in vegas. we have a suite at the flamingo. i was just about to leave for the airport.
power. there hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. most of the batteries are depleted.
at night?
actually, you may take it all now.
is this friedman, martin?  come on, scumbag. you’ve reached your sell- by date. tell me if this is friedman, where he is in los angeles and what name he’s using?
you don't need to cuff me.
it's not that i'm drunk, i'm just beginning to see what my mum was talking about.  what was my mother like back in the sixties? i'm dying to know.
thank you...
that way.  you?
me?  oh, hell yes.  three.  i love 'em.  i love kids.  anything at all can and does happen.
yes, sir.
they're very simple. i believe in the golden rule. i'm not the first man to die for preaching it. but if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
what?!
yeah, check out teldar paper, it's still not over.
landon, honey. there's nothing more.
everyone but me--what do you want now, mary?
no, he's not dead!  he lives in baldwin hills.  i met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
beckett? i'm sorry about... what's happened to you. it's a fucking kick in the head.
that's right. and you beat round 1. now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes. i'll have your girlfriend. we'll be waiting.
sun city. i've been meaning to call you for months.
okay.  i'll take a raincheck.  i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  listen, that reminds me, i'm having a party for all my clients.  it's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  i know you fill out your own tax return, but i'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
no, i swear -- i never saw this man before.
did you! imagine that! how long will you be staying?
well, you have the maxine action figure to play with.
i'll tell you what makes sense ! air strikes ! white phosphorus ! napalm ! we'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
i think i'll do what i damn well please.
are you going to be all right?
maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
it's simple, alan.  we send the vice- president to africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `president' to nominate a new one.  the whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
cop.
he killed milton! the killer's  inside there! oh god!  dewey! dewey's in there too! he needs medical help! he's hurt!
well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  and i'm expecting you won't mention it again.  i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  what are you, his shadow?  do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  you know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with w.p.  that means without you.  okay, pal?  let's eat.
can you lift the furnace.  i need money.
that sounds fun.
we can use the flamethrower.
i'm kidding, i'm kidding, we're still young, darien. so what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. after all, this is not the house in connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise.
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles.
good.  she's a good girl.  aren't you? yeah, she's a lovely girl.  and you know the queen's riding tomorrow?
i don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
about an hour and a half on the freeway. or two if you take the coast highway.
we don't have time, smith. in twenty hours we run out of air.
case #1108, previsualized by the precogs and recorded on holoshpere by precrime's q-stacks.  my fellow witnesses for case #1108 are dr. katherine james and chief justice frank pollard.
happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
what are you doing with all these blueprints?
i should like you to do something for me. it's an innocent sort of thing but i'm very set on it.
i know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. what's it like living in a locker?
she spoke to me.
rick, i'm going to flag a cab.
i need you to go to miami.
i don't understand the song. tell me plain how they did it.
home, school, here... 
what?
that's why i'm bussing it across america. i'm so glad you're here.  jim, i want you to meet two nice boys.
ext. ice cream truck - day.
i teach english at addley high school in addley, pennsylvania.
an error.
not really.  i've just always been fascinated by mars.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
bye bye, jane. and don’t be naughty.
that's it.  get 'im harry  we'll teach that little puke not to signal.
i thought you were never going to do that.
oh god. i'm overbearing and rude. lily. lily finn.
i don't feel sick. not yet. they tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. after that... well, i'd rather not be around for it.
gotta go.  see ya soon.  everybody happy now?
well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever polaroid head here got inside ellingson.
look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- i don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.
that viper has envenomed the water. no animal will drink here now.
it was inspirational.
listen to me, very carefully, okay?  you're not a terminator any more.  alright?  you got that? you can't just go around killing people!
don't you worry. we'll get some action.
corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
i don’t.
it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? it's so beautiful and still now.  i think i've got it all figured out, by the way.
i want to hear the truth.
what sign? fuck the sign. i want my car.
what is it?
what do you think?
don't i know it. every brother i knew in 'nam's dead. my company... a land mine. twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
no. 
hold on a sec.  lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
i dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
yes, sir.  don't worry.  we handle this kind of thing all the time.
julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. it's a fact.
yes.
tell you what, i'll stop by harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
the fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
be specific.
mr. pink.
oh mercy, yes. you gotta beat that competition.
stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. there's something you're not telling me, jimmy.
mr. chairman... there's... another amendment... that i'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the fifth amendment.  i wonder if you're familiar with it.
what do you want to do?  you want to jam up that sonofabitch krendler.
in the corporate offices.
come here.
-- a brillo pad, i don't care, anything.
say... "equus"? it's got everything.
me too.
listen, before we get into numbers, i want you to try a taste.  i got a deck with me.
you think he's smart?
tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon. listen, we've also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. i'd keep my eyes open if i were you, sam. bye.
nah.  hates his wife.
i understand, sam, i know exactly how you feel. so i brought you a bottle of barley water.
what?
he's going to be ashore with you.
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
so tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study english with?
if they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
they're doctors?
what's your name?
not disintegrating, alan -- digitizing. while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month. the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
exactly. and we need someone to cut through it. we hear you're the man.
we're all very proud of you, harry, but what the hell is it?
i don't know what you're talking about!
look!  janie!
oh, yes, i remember -- and i should have slapped mrs. teasdale's face when she told it to me... i'm going right out and find trentino.  you go right out and get yourself an army.
i've retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you'll find helpful.
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
you want a queen? got one right here.
yeah, problem was, i had the only copy. see ya.
...i suppose.
i read your column every day...
we have to tell her she's in danger!
from?
*this* is.
in the guest room.  i've laid out a paint table for them.
let's hear it.
if the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  the murder of mrs. harry silverstone -
i told you, leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
when i was a kid... i was never allowed up here...
oh, you gonna make me say it.
...four, five.
not the bible?
yeah.
your mother's dead, llewelyn.
it seems human.  to me.
i'm sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. now i'm not expecting miracles. i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. i'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.  that was very good, john, very good. that's all for today. we shall do some more tomorrow. mothershead?
truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  we've got a surprised, heather.  a great big surprise for you and our audience.
sure. especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
no one understands! -- even my own men.  what do you think the communists respond to?  honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on tv crying?  hell no!  i understand the communist mind, i've studied it for thirty years.  they grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, henry?
who'd pay him that kind of money? not the mob. they got their own guys. specialists.
you didn't think so then.
sit down, and shut up!
we did our utmost to have it set ahead.
i would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
you said it was going to be social, giles. no business.
shooting.
eight and two thirds.
nothing.  'cause how you do delivery on the beach, i don't like.  maybe this does not work.
uh-huh.
but then it is better this way, don't you think?  no loose ends.
giancarlo... rinaldi.
sin-i-ful
that's my fault, not hers.  i've got to keep practicing.  i'm still in the learning stage but magic, madmartigan, requires concentration and--

don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
hang you like the witch you are, unless--
and bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
you tell theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
good luck.
you're going to listen to me.
he doesn't know what's going on. leave him alone.
kennedy.
fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
it's not a guy...
h'ya, senator. i--i've sorta been looking for you--
i really think you're overreacting in this whole -
johnny... life is so different from the way it was. one day you'll see what i did was best for both of us.
i used to be so proud of him. my big deal daddy. and now, he's just a crook. worse even. and the weird thing is...
i got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
saunders! i'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the brooklyn bridge--
yeah?
the new man. i'd keep away from him, if i were you.
this man's still alive.
you love him?
i didn't say that - i'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
i don't know.  maybe eighteen grams.
but i have no excuse to close it.
you're a little too fast.
toy poodle!
sidney...i...i don't do this sort of thing...
i beg your pardon.  li mu bai and i aren't cowards.
what's on your mind? don't --
in a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  if there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
so did we.  i mean, sherlock here.
you know, i never told anybody this, but i always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
there's so much i want to tell you. i'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. it's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. it's opening me to a death.
i love you, grady.
does that include helen filmore, united states congresswoman?
listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
whatever! he never told me about the van gogh or any of the other paintings.
it must be some kind of a gag.
that's been noted.  but where does it lead us?  unless you have something more to add.
we have to do something. what can we do to help, selina?
i'm trying to slash my wrists.
kiss me.
you should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
sure i've been to the cotton club. it's pretty sweet. but it don't hold a candle to the boom boom room. that's where the real action is.
you're so predictable.
what happened to them?
what if you don't get caught?
i'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
i could come for a second opinion?
nah.
coward.  giving up.
where's my baggy pants?
mr. gardiner, my pleasure.
you want to go talk to him?
heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
any books you like to read for fun?
but what if we leave them behind?
you hope.
all well and good -- but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
it's everywhere. but water is always the door.
agent duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
don't worry sid i'd never leave you like that.
when i'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach.  not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  not with that look.
really.
"go back, michael.  do what you can..."
this isn't possible...
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
listen to andy, sean.
"you do get the opportunity...you get them.  as i do, as anyone does..."
just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
i wasn't.  i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio.  he said someone was...
for christ's sake, violet!  i heard you!  thin walls, remember?
she lies all the time.  why would i say i fed her if i didn't?
life is pain, highness. anyone who says differently is selling something. i remember this farm boy of yours, i think. this would be, what, five years ago?
but we saw earth destroyed.
and i love and admire him more than any man i ever knew. i read these poems. he's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. what i have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing i have ever done and the most disillusioning.
go, go, go!
okay. i'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  it doesn't seem to be too long.
not much, i think.
but i have no sister.
no, but...
that's frustrating.
i can't promise he'll hire you. i'll have to tell him about your history.
yeah... he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... fox hunting... before i was born...
thanks.
hey...hey...it's okay!
he won.  he was a winner.  that bothers you.
christ, that's right.  how could i forget.  what a nightmare.
i'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
vegetable, right. my mistake. it seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. they fled into the tunnels beneath paris, that's all we know...
sorry, brother. i didn't mean any offence.
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this i'll help it presently!
a.i.?  you mean artificial intelligence?
yeah, i got it.
yes.
do it!
sh! then you must keep it true. goodnight, darling.
i will join my grandfather there.
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers.  good for four months.
don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
i think...it...works.
i disappeared on you?
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here.
oh wow, a real evil canieval.
i know, i was wrong.  but morg, look, we got to get out.
do you sing and dance?
oh.  well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
i hope that isn't true. we need all the downy innocents we can get.
i did? what do i tell a source on the next tough story? hang in with us. you'll be fine... maybe?
yeah, but for who?							*
finish strong!  are you <u>nuts</u>?  are you nuts?  this's pennies from <u>heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, old shoe, his plane forced down...and yet...
mr. carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
tell him i'm out. no, tell him i've passed away. an old war wound or something. tell him i'm dead. and no more calls!
that is correct.  nothing.
suits me.
no.  i'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  and that's all the news that's fit to print.
cuter.
that way.
we don't have to kill him.  just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  it was your idea, remember?  i'm doing this for you.  i'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
thank you!
yeah. i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
huh? oh. son of fury. with tyrone power and frances farmer.
and sold it to mister laplante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor john.
i've called the hospital; they've notified consiglere genco's family to come and wait.  he won't last out the night.
it will?
i felt like destroying something beautiful.
no, no, no. i'm fine. it's small, i wanna keep going --
i agree.
she likes you.
october 22, 1969.
looks like it's adrift.
what the hell am i supposed to do with him? take him to the zoo?
and what if i run into one of those things?
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg.
i work for him.
yes, it is.  would you tell me your name again, please?
dick.
well... you're looking well.
tell me.  i can help you.
hey, smart ass, how 'bout i kick your butt?
no plants.
it's only on exhibit at the queen's museum this month. even if you could get into the museum, the mask bas its own security system. a special, randomly programmed interval code.
i'll prove it!
of course. what happened to your face?
listen, lothar.  you know that crack i made about your...butt?
don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
about what?
the truck's here. looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
how'd you get the tape?  why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
it seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
oink! oink!
where, amy? where do you see her?
let's have a butcher's. jesus, there's lots of everything. we've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
because you young americans think the world began when you were born. you fall apart when you don't get your own way.
don't bump me.
well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of hana on the island of maui...
lara --
to death?
only in the leg or the thigh. you'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
no it's not.  he should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker.  he's never been there for me.  i've always been alone.
skip, you're a visionary. that can be a burden.
just looking around.
you don't smoke.
that right? why's that?
whatcha doin' to me, man?!  i got six kids to feed!
ready to go.  who signs for him?
how many different girls? didn't we already have this discussion once?
you do.
you are precious. please, call me gale.
is that why you brought him? because of me.
this is miss marsh.
do you usually pay for charlie? at "trattoria <u>valentino</u>"?
everything.
no, not tonight. i'm in bed too. i'm calling because i need you to listen. you're supposed to be a smart guy. you're a professor. i got this theory. jack says he didn't see twombley shot but he did.
get out of town, bobby, as quick as you can.
no, it's me, billy. i need time. i'm still adjusting to my mom.
i got the gasoline --
what am i doing here?  there are so many things i wanna do that aren't this.  paint a lighthouse. kiss a woman in italy.
shut...
too much glamor, huh.  what's in the bag - - monte carlo?  apes in kenya?
why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
i haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
you might have to, if you went with me. ever try to keep warm in a c-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
what's the matter, doris? business bad?
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio. people start imagining things --
good news, bud, the mayflowers have moved up the time-table. you're hitting the vatican to-night.
sorry about today, man.
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
you have a record of what happened in the operating room...
do me a favor, al.
the little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
is julia going with you?
like hell they wouldn't.
i'll apologize for everything but today...today i give a shit.
what?
what do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
how about...?
gee, thanks, lou.
please.
you can make a mistake.
why do you have to bring that up? there's always risk -- life's a risk.  it's worth it.  besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  well, i think we've done enough for today.  you've been cooped up in there too long.  how about you and me go out on the town?  they're expecting us.
and two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  frank, i can't sing that fucking song anymore!
i'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
you said something to him, didn't you?
huh.
hey, i know a lot of things!
well... sure...
i got your message... but you went right to johnnie, didn't you?... i can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... naughty girl... sailor and lula are headed west, and guess what? there's no turning back. i'm in a killing mood.
well, then, i'll tell you what i'd do.  i'd jump daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
nothing.
i’m not worried, mom. he’s still learning our ways...
that's twenty-six dollars.
what do you do, fink?
in a democracy, cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. your brother's practice...
at the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  they connect in unimaginable ways.
you think you're doing these people a favor? what are they going to do? either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
no ! just get up. this is serious.
that doesn't make sense.
weird, huh?... know what i think is weird? decent men with loving families go home every day after work. they turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
she's already on a plane back home.
yes. on my torso.
they want me to go to the conference with sollozzo.  set up the meeting for two days from now.  sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  so i'll feel safe.  they'll check me when i meet them so i won't be able to carry a weapon; but clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  then i'll kill them both.
fok yu and fok yu two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
what's wrong?
yes, something.
death to dragons!
yes. i must have been pretty much plastered if i hired a valet.
i bet you did lots of bad things.
okay... let's say that, for now.
i don't understand.
i'm sorry i'm so late.  bollocksed up at work again, i fear.  millions down the drain.
ha ha ha.  hoo hoo hoo.
after he tried to shoot you?
sure. yes. medical, i don't know.
and you think i don't want those things?  you think i don't stay up half the night wondering if i've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what i'm giving up for it everyday?  let's get married.
i know.
because i can't! okay? she wouldn't understand!
probably going.
dignan, it's --
i just wanted to say that. come by my house.
the stripper's here.
our greater goal is more important, brother.
i don't know...
lursa and b'etor? this doesn't make any sense. a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps geordi and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades. why? what the hell's going on?
let me have some apple pie, helen.  who said anything about war? all i said was that some gulls...
hi there.
so how did it know my name, then?
i don't know.
after, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. dr. towler called me in. he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  and he told me to change the form. he told me to change the one to a nine.  or else, or else, he said...  he said he'd fire me. he said i'd never work again... who were these men...? who were these men...? i wanted to be a nurse...
they teaching that now?  good. only a couple of 'em held out--this man, john horse, and his friend wild cat, and a fella name of osceola. army put all of them in prison and osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. beat zach taylor and a thousand troops at lake okeechobee.
not really. maybe a little.
sure you do.  everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house.  it's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  not for lack of trying.
which one?
look, i didn't shoot him!
you're not cured yet, my boy.
well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
eleven. in the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
no, i suppose not.
he's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
i didn't conceive of it for the lions- i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger.
did i tell you i'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
you know, it's the whip -- the one uncle frank got me from mexico.
where is everybody?
swim for it!
lazy ... lazy ... i ask you, freb: what's the matter with kids today?
what do i think?  i think if those marines from powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.
i know he wasn't much of a father.
can you?  i couldn't.
grant? why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
what the devil do you mean?  you have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
yes dear?
i guess you have.
thank you.  i would.  nice.
i know. i know.
i'll pay extra
hearsay.
you don't have a boyfriend?
let's fly!
sure thing.  look, i've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  you can go home.  gimme til morning.  find out who he is. until then, don't sweat it, huh?  just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
-- i paid this fucking guy -- i paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- i told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- mr. thomas.  i told mr. thomas i didn't know this guy was already married -- i admitted this!
right.
i can.
against.
lonnegan.
caitlin's on the same wave-length?
listen to me....
jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
of course not.
mr greenleaf.
i just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  for the future!
um... yeah but it's more...
wait.  you know who it looks like? yeah.  anderson.  uh... james anderson.  he isn't in today.  he took the afternoon off.
i guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
then why don't we go?  you might be an interesting subject of study.
some do. i didn't.
this motherfucker sounds charming!
you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and i'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
mike, it was real. it was glorious.
oh yes. he's really proud of his work.
if loomis read memos he's be here. fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. my hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
camelot ...
i'd like to do that.
no thanks. i'm looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts.
albert lucas trumbo.  but you've been "luke" since you were a baby.
margie. thought you might need a little warm-up.
you could see the speedometer?
we'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
come in.
i got others.
great room...
it's a lie!  you're a deserter! you're an impostor, sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
the heart pumps it.
yes. i think it will be a simple solution. they'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. it'll neutralize the virus. it'll revitalize the immune system, and people with aids will become healthy again.
smokey was on our tail. we had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
i'm asking it.
meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. he left the window open when he came in. his only mistake.
anya! what if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
how come i'm still in black and white?
yeah, dad. it's great.
no, i haven't.  i suppose all the waxworks are coming?
sure.  bases loaded.
we've only seen and talked to one suspect. he calls himself "joe". there's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. they have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. they knew what they were coming for.
i know.
and if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
why am i great?
huh?
give the flower a drink.
uh, huh?
i'm at the airport.
awright.  fire-team a.  gear up. let's move.  two minutes. somebody wake up hicks.
lookin' good.
he's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
april.
that's it.  we're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
well, for the same reasons we do, sir. don't you see?
they've already been identi- fied.  there's no doubt.
not much.
you're really good, you know.
fuck!!! that is so bullshit!
captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
i don't know. they might be dead already.
nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i don't know what i'm doing.  i mean i'm acting like i've got it all together tonight.  but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her.  and i don't know what i'm gonna say.  so now it's like, maybe i'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
oh, hell. drink?
french people need a visa to enter this country. that takes time and i didn’t have any. i used a british passport. my name’s not lamont but lombard. xavier lombard.
that's not true, doctor. please, tell us about your childhood.
forgive me, father.  for i have sinned.
okay, just ask yourself.  what do women really want?  you take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  stuck in a rut.  they need some release.  the promise of adventure.  a hint of danger.  i create that for them.
that's thinking.  now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  he's...that's what i... that's thinking! "who?  who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
me? no. rich food - it kills me. ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
i felt limited. i felt confined. i felt like i was suffocating.
some of his solo stuff's not bad.
i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.
then i'd think there must be a reason.
very good.
i appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
you're all through with this now?
he said you're quite chubby. and you have a nervous tick.
nope.
oh right, last night. i guess i owe you an apology.
pick it up, breaker.
stand by the door.
i'll be around.
i've got to finish this chapter anyway.
guilty until proven innocent?
sam! no!
fuck you.
i can't believe it, daddy. i know it must be true, but i can't believe it.
was that you? i remember that. i was only three or four, but i always heard about it growin' up.  they say you're well?
pick up a burger for fred. he's going crazy. 
sir, congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  you're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
we are covering up!  for some petty, stupid shit.  there are things i can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. but when i say them nobody believes me anyway ...
what do you mean?
i saw something, i saw...
we're actresses.
they wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  they'd send someone later, when we're alone.
about what? your marriage to anne!
no.  so.  is it working out with ian?
let me demonstrate some examples.
yes sir.
sounds toasty.  we're going pavilion.
every performance? then - am i safe in assuming you like it?
hawkins isn't the target, richard low's the target.
you seemed interesting.
my people are good to go.  you know who i mean?
hey, what i did for you is working out?
i saw him. just a minute ago. some guy.
oh god. what hospital?
that's right, me.
god. people exaggerate so much at this school.
just wanted to see how your doing.
could i?
yes, sir.
why?  because i remind you of someone?  that's not very complimentary.  and nothing would... happen...
okay, okay... i won't say a word...
mom... when is the war gonna be over?
no.  i told you everything, you lied to me.  i would have done anything for you.
i brought you haagen dazs. chocolate.
moving to sweden.
so let's get busy.  have some fun and make some deals.
please, beverly, this is hard enough.
we've got spirits and beer. if it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
like what?
come on. be polite.
yeah. sure. yeah. we're on it bigtime. lots of leads. you bet.
what is it?
what kind of pies do you have?
no, it's fine. thanks for making the call, i guess.
not there!  a pine tree in death valley? idiot! this is for the north woods section!
you never thought that's a heavy load?
she's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
his horse.
who? van dorn? you must be kidding yourself, honey. you think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
let them.
so we understand each other?
i don't know.  i hadn't worked that part out yet.  all i knew was that i liked you, and i didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
who are you revolting against?
you're attractive, you're smart.  stand on your own two feet, know what i mean? and you got a wicked sense of humor. man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all i could do--
no.
he's her?
we avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
she's right in the neighborhood. she's upset.
you don't have to do that.
sure, but...
--i haven't said anything--
no.
i just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
sorry.
well, nadia, it it's all the same to you, i'd like to give it a bash.
and scary.
what's that, chief?  say again.
of course, of course, of course.
the twenty third of january. on that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. customs has been
and you've seen eddie rama.
it wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  not a wit. do you know why?  because you're a man without scruples.
she might have used an alias. mary crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
oh, no, hey.  like i said. tammy wouldn't... she...
-humidity, i know.  highest lead density on the market.
what's that on your forehead, pal?
yeah.
what?
lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. it's like you come from two different worlds.
and we all went through that together?
get us one.
daniel burdon, fbi.
i don’t know. i don’t know, man. i don’t even know friedman that well... i...  man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
yeah. that was me.
i must insist that you leave.
he lost a shoe!
oh come on, kathryn. it's too easy. "but i thought high school was only four years." i mean, please. she knows nothing. she's seen nothing. i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. i have a reputation to uphold.
prevacid.  for my stomach.
i love you, lotte.
well, sire, i made some inquiries in a routine way. i was curious to know why he had so few pupils. it is rather alarming.
ain't your fault -- here's the problem.
and if that means negotiating...
you killed him you fucking faggot --
so what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
what?
what!
sure.
twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
no, no, no. this man's going to jump off a roof.
i like the way you think.
that's where you're wrong, clayton. you've just told one.  a very good story indeed.
now.
then don't talk about killing.
what if i chant?
face it, we're the men for the job. besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and find the goddamn pem.
take it for christ sake. i wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
you'd look naked without one.
how long you been doing this?
again. thank you.
that's great.
you okay?
that's what i mean.  this is the quietest i've ever heard it.  it's unnatural.
who knows? if dr. darling is right, you should watch out.
why not?
one thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
i'll find her.
write from your heart.  that's why the classics are great.
no primer.
it's lonely in there, in my room.
did you ever dream that you were someone else?
i'm giving you a chance to walk away.
in ruhengeri?
she want to play?  fine.  i can play.
married.
what's the matter with bjorn?
i'm a parent, i don't have the luxury of principles.
because i don't like you.
don't underestimate me .. the mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - how many times have you been up at that institute?
veronica, it's not easy for me... i don't know if i can change overnight. but what i'm telling you is that i want to share everything with you, because i don't ever want to be without you again.
you're right. good.
good? i was-
why are we so successful?
and you're a nice man, quince.
you're gonna use a ram?
he is only curious to know who you are.
come on!
i wrote that when i was twelve... where'd you get that?!
it's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
goddamn it. get in here. i can't stand around waiting.
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook?
i hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
don't you think he trusts us together?
you're close, crash, you want me to run you?  i'll run you!
are you making fun of me? i won't be mocked. do you hear me? i won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
he'll die -- !
did i say anything?
lana, i'm from metropolis. i see superman every day.
the same way i'll know that you went to scotch.  trust.
figured if i left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
i'm already in town, but it don't matter. we got dick in the bank. we dumped it all in harry's movie.
i'm sorry, i was at the theater and i didn't receive your note until i returned to my hotel.
wait!
you win, inspector.  you win all along the line.  why didn't we think of brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  yeah.  of course you did.  when a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. wait for a mistake.
right.
terry valentine.
shit. we're fucked.
you comin'?
yeah, casey and steve were completely hollowed out. takes a man to do something like that.
god, you're really obsessed...
wake up, people!  we all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! it's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
boss, the president's been shot.  in dallas.  five minutes ago.
it's for your cigarette.  i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
huh?
sorry.
jefferson airplane. "white rabbit." i want a rising sound.
a little... you think it's the same for jacques?
yes.  you?
i'm shomer shabbas.
yes, you have a suit i've had my eye on.
then let's go. now!
was it you?  in the plane?  who saved my life?
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
i don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  they are very hard to walk around in.
we're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
how did you --
i thought not.
is it?  why don't you see for your self?
hey, man...
well, yeah, i'm fine, i reached over to, the girl had to be home, i don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
twelve seventy-five from the clarence? the son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  but he got you here.
sort of. sometimes. you're not building an obsession about steven, are you? look. i understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play.
nobody else.
and it ruins everything else.
vincent told you that i'm a cop?
wait.  wait.  the chains.  where did the chains come from?
he ain't nothing like me. how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? you ought to stop protecting him.
i didn't do anything, francis! they've made us believe that...
i know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. there's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. good for a five point pop.
not if you're more hungry than scared.
yes.  i'm tired.
lock the door.
of the woman in the mirror. would you know her if you saw her?
well, jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. his mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by crystal lake...  people started saying it was jason... back from the dead.
yes.
brother malcolm, i want you to meet brother earl. he just joined the nation.
-- and read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
we can't stay here!
no, i think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
into what?
maybe just trying to measure up.
nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
i promise you, i didn't know!
no, they don't.
just good luck.
sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
no.  nobody but you.
who am i supposed to shoot?
no.
this is treason!!  what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
it wasn't you. it was somebody else. there's somebody else aboard.
i've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. i've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but i need one more for my father. i've been trying all the firms, the shops...
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
oh - you're an actress.
so, how was the ride, kids?
i knew shit. the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else.  my real name's norm. i deliver pizzas.
i'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  i'm dying here.
i want a child.
five-eleven. one-eighty. regulated hypertension.  how would his son describe him?
but this is barbaric!  have you completely lost all sense of --
don't tell me your ticket was in it?
i'll pay you on friday.  and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
wait -- hold on a minute --
what's that?
not eight...
the very same.
what? bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
i don't know what to do.
what are you suggesting?
i want to go home.
ben, i think we're two civilized human beings. do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
it's okay, lenny  they'd never get here in time anyway.
it's okay.
let me take a look at that map.
cool it, palmer!!
sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  there's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  we only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
i don't know.
you're right -- i am a coward.
oh, leave off!!!
i'm... i'm doing a very special thing here. and you can't even ... respond?
-- shut up! don't you try to make me feel bad about this. you knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. this is on your head, not mine.  break his arm.
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital. then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
what?
well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. a square job and a quiet life. you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo's boys will be all over you.
swear.  olaf, metal!
sanford's brother dates her cousin. he found out this morning.
is he dead?
did you ever touch her?
okay.  but, what?
i was not informed about observers.
why you don't feel love?  not allowed?  dead inside, maybe?  you make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  in-vulnerabo?  bullshit!
you're teasing still.
see, i know that.
i told you. i got drunk.
wake up. stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
am i going to lose you, bill? am i?
rawlston is my boss.
it makes us human ...
tell him about making sourpuss chairman, honey.
next time we'll bring more blankets.
what!  what kind of pathetic line is that?
nice try, kiddo.
the mystery's all gone. and i wanted you to find out who did it.
you being cute?
yeah, somewhere?
what reputation?  you're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
i can't. the police have it by now.
pink panther, black panther. who gives a shit? and i don't remember asking you a god damn thing, you little turd.
there's nothing to say, doctor.  someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...i've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
why would he do that? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip.
tell that to muskie.
if you find her...
yes.
will it keep them out?
my dad always drives my mom.
damn straight. i expect those pittsburgh crawdads to remember that.
i'm here! take it easy! take it easy!  sit down, sit down...  did she come?
i just walked in.
...and put them in your mouth.
you tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- sport -- wouldn't let you.
she left me. crabs.
i do.
that's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? repressing your real self?
three... rudy got ambitious.
okay. two of 'em. both had my father. it's peculiar. i'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. so in a sense he's the younger man. anyway, first one i don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and i think i lost it. the second one, it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
oh, but it is.  he's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  that's a game.  it has rules and objectives.
i'm sorry, sam, i'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
i'm very sorry.
yes.
i... suppose so, yes.
you better.
what happened?
i don't know why you feel you have to lie, letty.
good job.  and thanks.
carbon units are not true life forms... do those images repre- sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form?
we can live like this? off the blood of animals?
nothing. i'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. i mean let's go see. let's go see if they do or not.
i love my job.  i love it.  the next time i'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and i'll get over it.
someday.
hush, baby.
yeah.  jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski.
oh jesus christ.
school?
i told him i was mrs sam rothstein.
unwritten rule of the sea.  we don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. ask anybody.
this doesn't even have burt reynolds in it.
i'm standing next to kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
so -- you're behind all this. i should have known.
i've done that before.
i'm still on course to victoria. nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
all right, peter.  good night.
i said get out.
maybe we ought to ask stella.
not at all -- a great privilege, doctor.
sounds good. i hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
yeah, well, why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous -
"a people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - yes, and then to get around them..." nietzsche said that.
gimme some room here, will you?  back off.  gimme some space.
but what could she do?
i am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
that's a day's work. but if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
we're not making that out too well.  what is it?
i can't!
shaddup bitch.
we have his note.
don't worry.  i'll have a cool scar.
you seem to have an answer for everything.
just give them the facts.  they can leap to their own conclusions.
i wasn't really dying, i wasn't host to cancer or parasites; i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....
i kinda doubt that. we're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
what's your malfunction, rico ?
the 'history'...?
yes. and i know you.
well, i... i... that's very nice of you.
oh i see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
and what a way to quit. while you're still champion! that's the way to leave, hildy!
i want d.a. bureau men to tail dudley smith twenty-four hours a day; i want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; i want authorization to check his bank records and i want it all in an hour.
looks simple to operate.
i was just saying, you know? i didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. i could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
no, robert.
teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  i'm not playing.
what ?
i thought so.
no, no medicine!
i was close to being scared that time.
well did you or didn't you?
that's too bad.  i would rather have him at home--to see what i'm going to do.
tea? who wants tea? let's go out! this calls for a feast. you don't want tea, papa. let's go dancing. papa loves parties, don't you?
are you crazy?  the joint is crawling with cops now.  you wanna go to rikers?  go to the hoosegow?
and don't make it too dreary.  how about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  he teaches at night.  right?  they don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  it's cheaper that way.  as a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
i've always looked forward to it. all right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
well... actually, no bill...
as a matter of fact i did.  they've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
your brother?
merrick...
i didn't even scratch the surface. you're lucky, boy.  you come home, and nobody's here.  when i go home, everybody's going to be there.
are you kidding?
well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  go fuck dick vitale.
i know.  thank her for me.
yeah. i'll go check on your boy.
i think you're making a mistake, sir.
good. i want you out. this is my sewer.
you're not really serious about this, are you?
beer, please.
well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new states growing in the west.
yes, of course. how much do you need?
no, i didn't.
i don't know how they got to me. maybe cause i repped him here.  the feebees run background checks.  on my mama's breasts, man, that's all i got.  there wasn't no conspiracy, jim.  if there were, why the hell didn't bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general, he was his brother for chrissake.  how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, i don't know.  it was oswald.  he was a nut job.  faggot, y'know, hated this country.
who the <u>hell</u> are they?
it is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
i know what i got, max.  they put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
how do you know?
ah, agent smecker, we have a problem.
well, rick, after tonight i'll be through with the whole business, and i am leaving finally this casablanca.
there's nothing there for me.
you don't believe in anything?
koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
gee, thanks friend.
real good.
no, you fucked you! don't invert stuff! big tobacco tried to smear wigand; you bought it. the wall street journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes big tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! and now, even now, when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! don, what the hell else... do you need?
i yield.
you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
that's alright.  don't misunderstand my husband.  it's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. and who would believe him if he told the truth?
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums. it was a famous case.
there are none here.
first of all, economic reasons.  it was cheap.  the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. it also seemed ideal in most other respects. it was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
you're a beautiful girl, elle.
orthopedics?
what's she like?
i knew this was going to happen.
we was outa food. tonight we had meat. not much, but we had it. think pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? an' rosasharn needs milk. think ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
i got that...sir.
quicker than gas. and it smells a lot prettier. it usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
what is it if it ain't a curse?
look, jimmy, you know, i haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
i will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- a low note on a dip stick is blown by one of the fremen tribe.  jessica shifts, paul sees it, and just as stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, jessica turns, slashes out, utters a sound, whirls again and with rock behind her holds stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. paul moves on her first move.  he races up a rocky incline.
oh, yes, doolittle, i'm thinking.
it will be a pleasure.  right this way mrs. torrance.
to get on the board.  yeah.  how you goan'a get on the board sell'n a polack?  and i'll tell you, i'll tell you what else.  you listening? i'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an indian.
telephone repairman.
yeah.  you don't wanna know the details.
uh-huh. that's exactly what i thought. beany, go on down to the office, tell pop to give you the speech. there's a copy on my desk.
 it says forty- nine.
don't blame yourself. in your shoes, i don't think i would have told parker, either.  so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality?
i know that. don't let him get away.
he has never gotten rid of the malaria. he is usually up and at it the next day. i'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
oh.
yes.
actually, my name is craig schwartz, dr. lester.
i already said that, b...
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
i'm always bad.
pity. mr. gibbs.
who is this, in the mask?  who is he?
how can i help you?
barnes believes in what he's doing.
i can't do this.
there! what's so hard about that!
i didn't mean to --
you sure?!
i'm eighteen. it's my decision, i think i'd make a pretty good pilot. i've good great reflexes. you need that for maneuvering, you know.
it's alright.
i have no idea.
i have no idea what kind of girl i am.
oh, yeah.  listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
that should decide it or you --
aren't you coming back with me?
o.k.
sorry. carl's a fine boy...
yeah, birds. all they do is make a mess of everything. who needs them?
she is a true psychic.  she sees beyond the relativity of time.  for her there is no past, present or future.  there is only what is.
vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the federation!
he's not. he's out of town and he calls me every day. what's weird about him?
speak for yourself.
make it the way i always do.
trip? where to?
thirteen hundred.
good.
no!
hindenburg...
-- because there'll be no remorse. not in my world.
i told you, something's upset them.
why not?
well, i --
of what?
can't you tell me anything?
well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... you really want to hear about this?
you must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  it wouldn't have been so bad, but even the medical officer for the district was killed!
well, i can't reach them.
well, fine... we could still look at c-block.
yes, i'd...i-i-i'd love, i'd love to get you this.
why??  i... i attend every year.
i'm not interested, carter.  you're no longer on this assignment.
you wife isn't dead is she?
no, i'm not. 
setting up. technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. but, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. the correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it's been damaged and --
not by the thousands.
yes... you will wait.
i'm sorry. let's go.
from what?
you never worked berlin...
what?! it looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
i'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  i'll work on the house.
can i go over to janeane's house?
not at all
and you?
the quiet can fool you.  it fooled me.  you can never be sure of what's out there.
i'd like to make a swap.
hardly...
sally ann cavanaugh. oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
oh.
our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
what exactly are you working on?
how could you do this to people?
viscera?
you can't keep bringing up starbucks. that was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
he said if i gave in to you i'd start losing again.
if you're selling something, i'm late for work...
haven't seen her since that day. ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..i don't think so. mama thinks she's gone for good. says she can feel it.
dynamite.
aristotle.
yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
but he was always a bad kid, that one.
she looks terrible, just awful.
really?
but you knew what they were training you for?
in general.
broke is more like it.
i think it's probably still a good idea.
i am the desert, where water disappears--
what the fuck are you doing here?
not at all.  i'll catch you later.
don't just stand there, get help!
that must be really difficult.
but--but how we gonna eat?
look, big head, i'll be at your car.
oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now.
fine.  good.
and his writing?
you'll try what we tell you to try, o'neil.  go regulation.
you're a movie buff?
i can get you what you want.  you just have to talk to me.  i'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  i'm the magic man, the santa claus of the subconscious.  you say it, you even think it, you can have it.  you want a girl, you want two girls?  i don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  you want to be a girl... see what that feels like? you want a nun to tie you up?  it's all doable.
baby wants to fuck.
you're right. i just wasn't sure you knew.
better judgment?! to wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
whatever.
i've got a lot of respect for you too.  for the way you feel about your family.
i know.  relax.  take it easy.  don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
you're qualified and available. and frankly, i can't spare a real agent right now.
yes.
is he nice?
that way.
ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
now.  i'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that drs. towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
martin.
yeah.
well, we could--
diseases.
what?
yes.
wasn't it!
drinks are free, right?
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
milo, you told me those doj agents are all over the place. how could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  and how can you get in there, anyway? with the cameras and the swipe cards --
go ahead. make my evening.
come with me.
what are you, inspecting the barracks?  you ready?  did clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
i'd like to think so. i know one of them went on to medical school.
maybe we should go now. you must be very tired. we'll call if any new -
who is pamela landy?
and you're not?
it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins, lotta outs.  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  i'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  it's just--
i'm serious, sam.
what?
what, you think i did this to myself?
well, hunt, what are your plans?
i'm bob.
yeah... i seen him around.  high- roller dude named strader.  joshua strader.  runs a club on the west side.  encounters.
good day, sir.
good thing you are beautiful, kid. you are <u>dumb</u>!
don't fuck with me, john, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
while they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
all aver the world.  they say he's spent half of his life overseas.
you take care of your end, kid, i'll take care of mine.
what was that bang?
i ain't interested.  and if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
so many people - know me. i wish i did. i wish someone would tell be about me...
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive...?
did you build the estadio olympico?
 yeah.
i don't think so...
the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  so what's wrong?
make sure it's elevated...
you need a new passion, louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
this is your great invention?  would you wear those things?
which way did she go?
man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? you won't get no place.
what the hell's going on?
you mean, like posed for pictures?
um-hum ...
anybody got a bp yet...?
i was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  no. i am not afraid. it is strange.
--but i gotta say i think there's something to this cold climate business. i mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. can't build no civilization that way. you got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
you don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
okay. soon? do you think i'm too fat?
don't go starting rumors, jim.  my son's college bound with or without basketball.
is he there?
is that your dad?
all right, folks, get on your mark. when you hear the pistol shot--
i must grant him his last rites.
thanks for the message.
if what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? a man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
so that stuff -- it kills people.
...gotta run dad. you stop smoking, you hear?
and what are you going to do?!
just a scratch.  i wanted to see you.
chopped liver?
but ellen, i told you i have stopped...
if you want to tell me.
wonderful.
yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "your request for transfer turned down --"
you work too hard, john.
you don't want to cut me down. 'cause i'll kill you.
which leads us to...
and he still sits there?
his secretary.  joanne braslow.
it has a broken leg!
what do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
am i a thing?
murdered him?
you said you weren't with him for love.
don't tell them you're lost. you'll never live it down.
seventy-one?  what's seventy-one?
who is he?
shh!
you say that just to flatter me.
... just give me time to think...
i didn't say braze.
do you think she loves him?
what do i want?
don't say a .
no thanks.
perhaps.
no.
uh...yeah, grandma.  she doesn't mean that.  kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
quit bullshitting.
an oath to a liar is no oath at all. an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
how ya doin' miss evans?
that's right.
in that case... no...
i left last year.
well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, i'll be sound as a pound.
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.
your timing is excellent, mr. scott. you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. how much refit time till we can take her out again?
thanks.
i don't believe it.
what's wrong with your son, anyway?
i don't look at pictures.  i look at the <u>real thing</u>.  i don't feel infected.
you get the girl.
it's like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl.
you sure? i just made it.
you're a fuckin' liar.
that was never proved.
yah, but think this thing through here, wade. ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? you gotta listen to me on this one, wade.
mr. appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "bread instead of bullets club?"
not that.  us.
it's ok, eugene. i understand... i'll go fix breakfast. 
i'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way i can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
you wanna bet?
mr. nevins?
...for the beans, yes...
i hear she's getting real fat.
goddamn it, where were you?
jesus.
you.
yes. did you eat?
cause burke and i are just friends. okay, really.
i just made this picture, over at screen classics.  it opens next week.
calculated risk.  only we happen to know, j.j., that you like me.  i'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent.
if you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
that's very kind of you. are you related to him?
...still don't feel no heat.
but we do.  hey, we'll always have maine.
fuck. you don't know how bad or anything?
two a year since i was twelve. you do the math.
it's just impossible.
you didn't hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
you're a poet and didn't know it.
of course? i thought he was dead.
pussy.
$20.
yeah.
ours.
if mom's a psycho, scotty will still be ok, won't he?
commander powell? commander, hello!
no! you will stand there and you will listen! what happened to you, bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world. you were the one who believed in it --
you played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
after all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
look, a man can make an honest mistake!! anyway, she was asking for it!  they're all asking for it all the time!!
but...  give it us here, you dozy sod. you hide and get the guns ready. wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
and where is this guest?  don't they want to interview him.
yes, and just one time can be enough.  thank you.
would you two excuse me for a moment?
i tell you, i feel like a ghost.
ah-ha! now i can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
i'll take care of you.
well, i'll be - !  he does have a bicycle.
jimmy.
well, i was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
there's been an accident, truman.
of course, jeffrey.
business first.  i went into the "warrants" system and erased your records.  you're clean.  in fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
you know what. how long since we've seen each other?
thank you.
i promise, dorothy. i promise.
when did he say it, norma?
hello, mom?
so am i. my friends were killed, too.
i feel sick.
well?
the nerve.
first her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! she batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! here!  you want? here -- it's yours!
i'm afraid i can't stop to discuss this logically --
we'll worry about that when we get there.
no. keep rubbing.
that he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that i'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
all right.  this is hard for me.  i'm a scientist.  i like order and logic. sometimes too much.  there's got to be an explanation.  there can't be an animal in there.  but i saw something.
listen.  last night - oh christ, this'1l take forever to explain. god, michael...
are you crazy?
no?
yeah, and i better call my sister.
what were you saying, commander, about the bomb?
thank you.
what? like, you didn't want to jinx it?
well, what can you do?
mrs. delaney.  did you hear the latest?
that was a beautiful message.
yeah ... well, yours. you still don't believe that you're the princess, do you?
you like baseball?
it wasn't elective. it was undertaken to save his life. and it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... look at the date of the first procedure.
a regular outlaw.
what?
what could happen to him, darling? you mustn't worry....  what is it?
why?  aw, come on, vicki, i'm a reporter. i'm curious.  i do this for a living.  there's a phone.  you can call him up and cancel.
you're right.  easy come, easy go.
sorry.  my hands are tied.
least you got your priorities straight.
you think i haven't been trying!  it's like there was never anything there.  just water.
i wish you'd go now.
i deserve that.  anyway, i've... i've only just realized
i said, no thanks.
well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
grissom, your message acknowledged. will advise... out.
nothing.
soldier of fortune.  business week. new republic.
the blast?  honey, i have survived a host of things. like the song says: "a country boy can survive!"
no .. but we have a theory ..
his name is...
you bet.
well, i'll be on the golf course in the morning.  then, if i don't have any babies to deliver--
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
oh, i wouldn't want to -- i mean, i'd want to, but i wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
hah, you're very cunning ada, but i've seen through you, i'm not going to lose the land this way. wait here!
when will they be back?
i have a message for you; i love you.  may i dedicate the next number to you?...and the next, and the next. every sunday i'll buy you a new bonnet -
"father of the bride."
he just needs some clothes?
wait here.  if you have to use this, use it.  don't choke. okay?
sure you do --
he's cutting down the visibility.
so you're angry.  big deal.
let's go look, then. let's go look, then!
yes, ma'am.
i understand you were in africa. whereabouts?
miss sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
would you?
jehuda, give me something to do.
wouldn't know anything about it.
someone who believes in miracles.
sure.
but you did, and have... and now people are dead.  did sparazza become more valuable than israel... and did you make another deal?
now don't get me mad! even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. if i were ever caught in there, i'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
you better go get 'em.
wife of edward, the king's son?
well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
jesus christ... <u>that</u> was the judge?
barzini is dead.  so is philip tattaglia, so are strachi, cuneo and moe greene...i want to square all the family accounts tonight. so don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
it is a pity.
not bad. i didn't expect you to make it out.
i'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
i don't..
look, marty, she's not your mother yet. and if you don't go through with this, she may never be. i know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. some choices must be made that are difficult. nonetheless, we must make them. besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. the fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . marty tried to smile at him.
no, it isn't, lamar.  there was nothing anyone could do.
what about r.j.?
mama, no.
seriously?!?
why don't you blow me, chief.  after your girlfriend gets through.
mariette!
i'm sorry.
to make you feel better.
that was the name of ricky tan's boat.
just gotta pull it a little tighter.
jen!
i just know.
run. run. let's go.
what did i do?
a) he's an old man with a really big penis. b) she never told me i was fat. and c) victoria principal sells on that network.
sounds like i'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
we're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
it's been changed.
my wife just went into labor...
twenty-eight years, frank.
let him go. let him take it all.
so, you have accepted the truth.
ohhhhhhhhh, how i hate you.
sabu... high white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
got dag pa dig.
you can't just stay out half the night and carry on, jeffrey. there's got to be some order, jeffrey. i thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
uh-huh. mom says i have your eyes and your --
coming to the point, please.
you mean for good?
because i'm all you've got.
sure, anything's poss...
excuse me?
i don't steal any --
almost eight. you wouldn't believe how weird i look naked.
yes.  i feel that, too.  weakness is what is ugly.
whatever you want.
well...dammit, if i'm doing this, how the hell am i gonna watch?
true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?
and blind people, crippled...
on screen.
no.  thank you.
i want to see her.  unless you show me simone live and in person i show these pictures to the authorities.
why would i?
and who's claude?
the dark prince is here.
if i talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
they didn't find any signs of life on the viking missions.
you can't...
maybe she is.
geller, this is way out of your league.
who?
they just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
i don't know.
we can do it!
we're from different worlds.
he whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  i know it was him!
do they have any reputation for drugs?
what is it with you litterbugs?  is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
you've got power, veronica. power i didn't think you had. the slate is clean.
i could of... easy.
she kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  leave us all behind.  that <i>he</i> was going to take her!
the white horse.  the horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
a daughter in oregon.
i hope i'm not interrupting.
did these guys teach you to talk dirty? huh?
yeah, they're so warm and soft.
you wanted ten thousand? you got ten thousand.
you understand what i'm saying? i want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
he can't find organa major.
the one with the v.p.l.
must be dangerous.  hooking.
i've got this weak heart. too much drinking, i guess. as soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
no, no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself.
the rembrandt--that was quite good.
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes. they came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's god's gift to women. one twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.
how could i know what else i forgot?
excuse me?
what about the engagement party?
so there are others?
there are monsters in the gelatin!
the financial kind. i figure i'm going to be working extra hours. all sorts of overtime... training sessions... not to mention the extra stress...
walter you look awful pale! what did you have to eat today?
how many, would you say?
okay, lovey.
homicidal?
oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you? we've discussed wittgenstein, for christ's sake. not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
let me speak to max cherry.
yes. i have her permission.
you too.
i' faith, i am sorry that thou art not well. sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
the united nations. madmen are on the streets, paul. but i will take care of you.  your cellar is well-stocked, right?
the letters in your journal. that and a geography book.  your elizabeth sounds lovely.
well, i know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
no... no...
sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
raincheck.
excuse me?  "throwers?"
okay, mr. popular.  you're on.
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced.  tonight i'm doing superfreak, i don't care what he says.  where is he?
if we don't try, zordon won't survive!
what's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
sara, this is doctor sheppard.  i called you earlier about a book.
well -- i --
i don't believe that, sir. we’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
i can't.
you -- you --
yes.
oh thank buddha it's you, kim-lo, i'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
you're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
negative.
bond!
damn straight!  we were heroes.
wait, wait! when i was finding these goodies in the shed. i also found this letter which a camper never sent home. listen.
it's fine today, robert.
i didn't.
contain it and get back to me.
james, you don't know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. i'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
sirrah!  sirrah, i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland!
silent night, violent night...
why don't you take off your clothes, mike?
what did you do to them?
perhaps... perhaps... i'm afraid i must first ask you to pass a test. i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
i don't know.  everything's so neat. it's all just so...goddamn dear.  damn!
bio-<u>busting</u>.  i <u>loves</u> bio-busting. who do i gotta kill?  family -- right?  obnoxious i bet.  mommie, daddy, piglets.
sir...?
but he said he died instantaneously.
the "other place," what is that...?
okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. i'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
yes.
sure it is. that's why you act so funny around each other.
no prob. i'm cool.
i am sorry, but i cannot stop myself. i think something is wrong
who the hell is this?
clean up?  i don't...
let him go or i will deliver you, right now. 
why are you doing this to me, rod?
no.  she tink lobo is waste of my time.  lobo don't talk.
he didn't say we need guns.
yes.
but--
again
i'm telling you i am, joe.
i'm sorry miss weathers. allow me to introduce myself, mark kincaid, l.a.p.d.  are you familiar with the actor ben damon, or the actress christine perkins?
yeah...
nothing.  he plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
jeez, and i never heard of him.
maybe i should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
yeah.
well, at least you're accomplished at something...
but you were business associates?
that's great.
uh huh. the retail end, i understand.
bruce may still refuse. it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
uh.  he thinks his nose is too big.  but it's not.
how did doctor almack react to that?
jesus...
later.
uh--senator--i thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
so how come you got into all this?
they made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  they always make a mess. we're better off without them.
whoa, whoa... what?!
not without a shot of the nest.
pass.
have to be. the shit she's gone through.
it's not good, ben - i'm sure you can feel it.
sincere.  what are you talking about, of course i'm sincere with you, mike.
yeah.  crap with a star.
of course.  don't you?
yes, i have. i will.
it's just the woman and the kid?
i'm a teenager. all teenagers are clumsy. it's because we're still growing. we don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
what was your relationship with her?
i have to go away, john.
well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
there's no reason why you should.  this has been planned from your birth. you fit all the criteria that we know of.  never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
this is fascinating.
that's what i'm counting on.
i'm not sure. i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
i was getting to that!
so, you're really going to stay here?
he has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
that's right, we'll get off at the next stop. the train's pulling into the station right now.
good to see you, ma.
most things.  we're very high on purpose.
a rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. i think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
did you bring bob's weights?
accompanies hilda into the hallway.
right.
that's what i have to tell you, rafe.  it wasn't a choice.  it --
why not, bobby?
if he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
kirsty.
get him alone for the summer. out in the wilderness. underneath the stars...
mother . . .
we, yes.  yes.  they, they present their side, and i get the same chance.  to cross-examine... to... to...
have a look.  at nothing.
she's absolutely r...
why you - what have you done with janet?
well, he's photogenic.  let's try dog bones?
jane, there was an envelope in my desk. the one i’d given you and then got back, remember? i can’t find it. do you know where it is?
don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
here. take my card. wait a minute... here's a special one. for top-shelf clients.
i don't mean now. i mean before -- before we met.
no!
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
all right, boys -- i think you can get back to your rooms. i don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. will we, braddock?
you know, every day for three years i asked myself that same question?
...and for our supreme commander over here and our commander-in-chief in washington.
a long time, with one man.
he doesn't know you.  couldn't you change?
huh uh.
just like that?
damn.
yes.
he fools around with his patients too.
if not?
oh harry, you're so funny. now i have something that's kind of delicate...
what?
you better hold onto your tongue!
actually, no.  i feel a little out of place.
really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. lifestyles of the rich and psychotic.
oh, my god.
don't rush ever'body, honey.
ya never tell a guy about a broad.
short of wearing a wire, i'll do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail. and in exchange for my help, i need permission to leave the country and immunity.
john hammond.  and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant.
you scared me.
give it back nicholas!
don't you see...
kate, give your old man a little credit. every person who chooses the service of god as their life's work has something in common. i don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a buddhist monk. many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am i a fool? we've all done it. i'm not going through a lapse. what i've experienced is closer to awakening. i'm not trying to shake your faith. i've just decided not to devote my life to god anymore.
better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
what happened to kurtzweil?
yeah.
of course he's moody.  he thinks he's in love.
bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break.
how many what?
how the hell did tan get away with it?
i got pain an' experience too.
what?  they found what?
it's yours, joe.  i gave it to you.
no, i'm just not that hungry.
i'll be okay.  just give me a minute.
i know a lot of songs about pirates, but none i'd teach a child.  let's hear it.
is it for a child?
that's what i wished on. edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
darling, where are the glasses?. oh. here they are.
after you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. she thought it was contagious.
his journals, letters, maps, books...
what?
jesus christ, it's a clusterfuck.
oh, look. i'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and i call it a ball. what would you do?
to complete my cure.
moving along -  a typical plastic security card. name here, magnetic information stripe here -  and a code breaking microprocessor here. swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
oh -- sure, sure! never better!
we keep them, in case the people come back.
what?
can you trust them?
i will run.
his name is will turner -- that's all i found out.
it's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
i don't need one 'cause i know what's really going on here. i have to finish this letter or i'll go nuts.  this can't be right -- con- science.
i've got a little challenge for you, sark -- a new recruit. he's a tough case, but i want him treated in the usual manner. train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
do me another favor?
not quite.
he won't take us.  don't you want us around?
i know a glenn.
okay. maybe tomorrow.
don't worry.  we'll take it out of your share.
good, have 'em down at stenner's old pool hall before 3:00.  we're gonna run through the route tonight.
yes.
what?
i have a bond receipt for you to sign.
beats me.
why not?
just wait here.
nope.
go to sleep.
i ain't got time, fred, honest. i'll see you after.
sarcastic, moi?  maybe i'll mellow when my ship comes in.  it's expected any day now.  i'm all packed and ready to go.
it's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
it is a disgusting habit, bertie.  it should be discouraged.
yeah. definitely.
zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
chad denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man i ever knew--
the point is the killer always goes, may i speak to starsky? he says his name.
sorry, max.  a die for a die.
no, you tell her.
i don't care if you do or... i want to see mary... before she gets in any deeper...
what the hell are you doing here? i thought you were playing hockey at one.
yes, sir.
plenty of times.
been out travelin' around?
finest kind. we'll sit where we can get the best view.
yes. it won't be long now. seventeen days.
yeah.  we already been there.  this is big, kenny.  benjamins.  secret service calls 'em superbills.  banks can't even tell the difference.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>what happens if jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
i feel it, too...someone's trying to get out.
that happens.
-- well you better go after her.
enjoyable too. the merger never even felt work for one second.
according to the data bank, we have - twice...
of course they're going to stay.  she's got some fresh orange layer cake. you know, with the thick stuff on the top?  sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
i just saw joe.  he's here.
i'll take chocolate.
they just want you to hire some new help.
i need help? whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, graham? not me, buddy. you're the fucking nut. now show me those tapes.
you go dry off now.
doesn't register.
huh?
hi.
i don't know. where did you hear that name.
stop him! stop that man!
up here --
what did you say?
you ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress debbie wore?
i gotcha, i gotcha chief!
yeah.
no.
gimme a break.
ethan, you're not making sense. let me go in and talk to kittridge. i'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
mind your business.
that is not an "option." there is no multiple choice here.
thanks.
now see here, my good man. i've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
ummm.
i don't know if i can do it alone.
i'm...i'm... oh no... i thought when i woke up... i thought sleep would do it ...
no.
i want this, sera. i need this!
what are you saying?
we'll need our birth certificates. i happen to have mine with me. where's yours?
does she want to be?
but it’s twenty degrees outside...
how?
i think she's pretty, mommy.
what do you mean?
what's the occasion?
this gets better by the minute.
you're not an easy person to get to know.
i'm sorry?
this is no time to be choosy, honey.  what do you say we debate this later?  there's still a chance i can get you out of here.
how much can you bench?
beckett. you seem... better. energized, more alive...
the people in the town?
she's real.  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall.
yep.
jack?  thank god.  i can't believe it's you.  i heard you'd been --
no.
people had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  and now they don't.
trashcan jack.  the big v.  i can tell you he's on the night train to the big adios.
nine hundred...
he's got a gun!!
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris, in prague, in brussels, in amsterdam, in oslo, in belgrade, in athens.
really?
no, not yet.
you mind?
didn't you hear me? caitlin really is getting married.
hey, i'm not dressed.
yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, i just can't read the serial numbers on your application. maybe if you could just read them to me -
would you mind opening the window?
me?
my cannon.
agent novak.  i didn't get a chance to clear him.
it couldn't be.
kill him when he gets down.
don't say much, do you?
too hard?! i don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
naw naw!
why, i'm fond of thea.
sra-i'm-sick! sra-i'm sick!
almost two days.
you will after tonight.  bet on it.
so that's it! "kestenbaum, kestenbaum." everybody was yelling "kestenbaum, kestenbaum." i thought it was some foreign language.
but then you don't get to watch the ball games. you told me you were a mets fan.
nah. couldn't be.
but you work for the casino?
angela, i just heard sal was alive.
the opera.
right.  we need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
fine.  we gotta him. 
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie's.
sir, the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. when they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
right.
do you think i like living this way? what do you want of me?!
izzat so?
and i'm the devil! now kindly undo these straps!
should i?
don't talk to me about courage.  i know death, what it's like to kill. you're not a killer -- you watched daryll lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  you chocked.  i know something <u>else</u> about you.
i just want to know why you're here.
i said you were never a faggot.
argento's good, but lewis is completely demented. we're talking buckets of goo. red corn syrup everywhere. and fake brains up the yin-yang.
you told me.  when you called you said she was in the other room.  drop the knife.
it is, if you like idiots...
i can't! i'm tied!
of course i'm serious. i bought it, didn't i?
seven hundred for the pair.
with what?
so wait a minute. the red sox haven't won a world series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
because it's murder we're talking about. aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
hi... what's going on here?
what about me?
transpo?  how they bringing the loads in...?
i tried.
don't you live somewhere?
that's just it, michael.  we don't!
why would she be hiding from me?
i'm not selling anything.  your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
why, i guess so.
i don't want to be reminded of what happened.
--what time is it?
about 5,000 troops.
mami, how old were you when my father--
and a french alliance?
he knew the immigration officer. he eased himself in.
ken!
i don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  we went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  it wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
let me have it.  "aboard the s.s. manchuria. last night conway seemed to recover his memory. kept talking about shangri- la, telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet. insisted upon returning there at once. locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore. am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. wrote down details of conway's story about shangri-la which i am forwarding. lord gainsford."
huh? oh, okay, i'm sorry.
koessler?
ah well. eh, look!
you're trembling.
yes. joe.
she was real.  where did she come from?
<u>computer off</u>!
i am thirty two.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... i <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
who've i got to beat up except the messenger?  does this give us anything to go on?
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
in the real world, when you get to where i am, there are other considerations...
i know.
sounds like a game show host to me.
what sales?
you've been listening in the whole time?
hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
oh, that's probably thomas j, i don't wanna see him. it's not fair. nothing happens to boys.
maybe just one word? kaput? because you're kaput, price.
well, javier rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
if paulie finds out, we got problems.
this isn't all that bad. we can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. put you on the rotation at long beach as a dock worker.
yes.
yeah, doolittle. what's up?
yeah, can you believe it?
pretty as a picture.
something important has got to come of it! do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  is your wife coming with you?
you're not even on this anymore... what do you care?
that's going on optimism.
if she got eyes, she do.
and get ourselves another touchdown to win.  i wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
i'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
who?
you're not far from cypher.
you got some?
a few teeth... that's the price of his life?
where did you get those?
you're kidding?
wladek! how are you?
anderton --
yeah, and i get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
that's the subject of my last chapter.
and?
she gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
or was it bryn mawr?
couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
well...
he's kidnapping me!!!
you have a lieutenant here...
that's his sister. vera webster.
just some young guy.  around twenty years old.  dark hair.
my medication.  i left it back there.
friend?
tell me.
you said a woman couldn't have done it.
who?
you are not alone. but you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
i'll get one more reading.
patriotism is its own reward.
that's just what they used to say in the ads. come on, crabtree, i know you're holding...
yup. sixty years old by our count. but he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: he's barely out of his teens.
you know, he hasn't harmed any of us. far as i can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. just stick to the deal, johns. let him go if that's what it --
sure.
i don't understand it. even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
in hope of what? learning that it's true?! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
i'm wise to you, i should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. how is it, huh? how do you like --
they don't love me. they love monkeybone.
or relieve me of it later.
chulo, one thing at a time.
the fucking point is--
oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
i gotta go along with mr. pink on this. i've seen it happen.
yes, it was me all along. i killed hugh kane and his mistress.
first, i have fun.
he's a great guy - leland.  why'd he ever leave new york?
what give you that idea. i seen one of the cats heard it.
she's twenty-nine, ma.
did the deceased ever threaten you? were you in fear of bodily injury?
i will. see you.
i'll go and make up his room!
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
so i've been told.
this is the big moment...!
sure honey, what's the hurry?
or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  and i wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
fear is their greatest weapon.
you an indian?
young blood
goddammit chief, why would i ever need to look in your files?  i saw enough here this summer to write a book.
what, come on?
how 'bout ted bundy? ever do one on him?
okay, mack!  whoowe, candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
no. but that's why we hated him. we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us. he didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. he got everything from them, everything. he was filthier than any of us party members.
be unto her o' lord a fortified tower.
yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. it really is the curse of the sequel. the billy/stu thing’s been done.
i'm still in the chair, lieutenant.
what do you make of all this?
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
good and bad.  they think that's what caused this.  me eye tumor. microwaves from the screen.  it's the size of a grapefruit.  heavy too.
and you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
margo.
it's funny. sometimes i forget. then it hits me, and i can't stop crying.
my name is sir robin of camelot!
you have to be kidding.
don't start with me, cooper.
i suppose i tried.
zander, you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now.
whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
crash, i didn't think you--
good idea.
this is supposed to be years away.
i went myself to oversee the operation. didn't help much.
shut it, teddy.
i've loved you ever since i can remember, long before you married tom dickson.
i know.
expendable assets, dillon. seems langley is never around when you need them.
but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus.  i'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
we've got nothing, bob.  this won't work.
yeah.  clay.  i met him sometime in june of '62 at the masquerade bar. dave ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
bob is dead, tyler.  the police blew a hole in his head.  was that part of your plan?
you - are - a - murderer.
what’s the difference? i’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
little late for that.
oh, i don't know, thelma.  i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays.  maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
and her voice? like lark song?
i'm glad somebody finally cried. every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death, i want to cry.  i don't cry, of course.  not manly, you know.  did she try antihistamines?
great.
might be tight.
then you know i'm not walking away from this case.
nothing, really! it's good to see you.
it was all pretty informal.  didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. mine's just a little more personal.
then what?
huh.  i did not know that.  well, it's water under the bridge.  and we do enter the next round-robin, am i wrong?
your apartment.
finish what?
but why all nudes?
you're done, come down, and let's...
yeah what's this, murdered elephant?
rose... your mother and i have been looking for you --
you're not gonna catch him. he can shape-shift into different animals. bear. elk. porcupine.
when you get to fiji?
that's right, striker.  and we're getting married when we return.
all right.  if you can take back the sword in three moves, i'll go with you.
i don't mean that. i worry when you try to ignore it.
the one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
where are you going?
i don't know what you're fucking talking about.
i don't trust anyone.  that's what comes of working in television.
i do?
i loved him!
well, i don't know. i gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
yah, he - he's been struggling. he's living with his parents now.
i just - hate it when they're - finished.
have you ever bent your knees, malcolm?
they have these little sticks, vince. they call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
primary arming switch.
no.
you're both going to a lot of trouble--  maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  i'm sure you're sincere...  ...but i was being groomed for something like this myself.  even without the accident i don't think i would have made it.  my point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
on what?
huh?  oh.  uh... pears
no, keep trini out of this. chotiner's too old.  and for god's sake, keep colson out.  it's time to baptize our young counsel.  that means dean can never talk about it.  attorney-client privilege.  get to it.  and dean -- you stay close on this.
synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "i could eat a horse."
mrs. dudley'll be waiting for you.
she can.
all in good time, mister mcmurphy. all in good time.
who're you?
i've asked him to try and locate the site.  okay with you?
quiet, my dove. quiet, or i'll ...
i couldn't stay in this place.  i wouldn't.  i'd just pick up, do whatever i had to do, and get out.
no problem, man.  hey, you wanna hit?
yeah.
i didn't want to come, i didn't want to see all this, but i couldn't stop myself.
find nedry!  check the vending machines!
congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  they'll never know whose leak it is.
what do you mean?
you think?
had to get away for his health, i suppose.
joe--*you* know what i'm talking about. the perfect man. never in politics in his life. wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. but the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
give me the bat.
but you triple-dog-dared me.
that depends on how mother's feeling. you'll excuse me, gentlemen?
it's large enough...
superstition.
okay. be careful.
y'know, i told myself a million times i didn't want to be a fireman. i said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. i know i split, and i know how you felt...
if it didn't happen in louisville, it'd happened someplace else. if it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. that's the kinda dame she was.
damn it, val!  not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
watch it!
they really hated it. i think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
what's it like where i'm going?
i intend to.
tom, daddy would like to see you in the garden.  and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee. and remember to say 'please'.
"cinderella man grows hair on chest!"
well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. you tell superman we think he's wonderful.
as long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  come now, child.
what a coincidence, i am someone!  mmm. calvin klein's obsession. now it's mine too.
you! and she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
what?
in sections! and one other thing, doubting tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance! if he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
thanks, yes, i think we did.
hey! oh!
i was desperate. it was gross.
yes. of course..
say what you gotta say, but i ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. not never. you hear?
sir?
you do. to get out of here. you're gonna be me.
hey, brad. are you still a virgin?
but where will you go?  we're in the middle of nowhere.
about what?
it's not like i'm miles away.
hey, man, congratulations!
if he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  crocs hang around the food source.
right and don't embellish.
look, brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. don't forget, she contacted you. she's out here for her own reasons, god knows what they are.
general faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson?
i heard you playing.
i'm trying hard to follow you.
who's there?
that's a crock.  we don't say that. do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? if it went public?  the white house would have to act through channels. we're talking ransom.  four billion bucks in war reparations to vietnam to get the others back.  that's billion, colonel.  with a "b".  for a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  a pain in the ass to everybody?  no way. there's no way.
nothing's wrong.  it's great, okay? having the time of my life.  mac's a fantastic director.  and what can anyone say about cal that hasn't been said.  and it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
is that why you joined the marines? for your father's sake?
damn straight!
did you ever turn tricks before?
funny.  so am i.
the kind with the most poles.
i don't think you understand the full implications of --
well, well, small world. annie hayworth.
you won't come on too strong.
you could have called me --
fifty dollars more.  that's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. and where'd you plan on getting the money from?  maybe you thought you'd pay your friend jake mckenna a visit.
they'd have a good neighbor, jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
i mean, what do you want?  what are you doing hanging around here.
here, hold up!
i think i know my son.
i'm not worried about you.  i'm worried about the safe.
she lied.  cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  besides, junior cut the phones.
of course you can stay. this belongs to the people.
keep trying, sergeant.
whoa!
we got to get out of here.
what's he got against me... i mean, i 'm a teenager. you can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
so i'm no more responsible for my own decisions while i'm here at work than, say, the death squad soldiers in bosnia?
oh, it isn't your fault, amy. you're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
yah, that was different. management was restructurin'--
yeah, i did.
oh god veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. if i have to sing "kumbaya" one more time...
does everyone in the world know more than me?  jesus, i'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....lifted a piece of licorice when i was one and a half.  who knew it would lead... they even got the cia involved!
if lenin were alive he would say, "buljanoff, comrade, for once in your life you're in paris. don't be a fool. go in there and ring three times."
just say no.
i am?
very good.
apollo?
for god's sake, the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
she said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
gaiijin?
really?
are you?
i don't know no gibson. this is a restaurant. many people come here.
i know where to look.
the british army is right back there, across that river!  sir!  i think it must be something else that detains general lee.
you shit! i'll decide if i go or not. not you. i don't know what you do on your planet, but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
just stay where you are, corporal! don't move, carl.  you'll blow up. i know you're tired!  i know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. do you hear me?
what do you mean?
look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  why do you want to kill more innocent people!  why!
oh.  'bye, doc.
so some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
you shouldn't. he likes you.
jag gets here in three hours. try for the confession.
you forgot your keys!
all right, you buy me a drink.
what're you nuts--
you listen to your voices, i listen to my heart.
oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. i used to give him directions. higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. useless.
what was you saying?
your classmates?
yes, you do. it's very discreet. there's no names in the papers. you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
hello, bob.
fine, quincy.
that's like saying they're in arizona.
there's something else scary.
i don't know ...  maybe because you've never needed my help.
roger meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
we're not certain!
or what? you've gone round the bend --
talks all day, too!  how the hell can you put up with her, john?
suspect zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
congratulations. you should spit in my face.

give eve harrington job in you office.
why keep harpin' on it?  come on, drink up. you got to get a little fun out of life. what's the matter with you?  i'll play you some music.
data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
well, you're a brave young lady. you're made of stronger stuff than i thought. you're a little viking!
why?
and this mr. hank aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent simone is an invention himself?
where did you get this clown?
you mean aneurysm.
especially this last year.
the outlets.
so are you.
oh well... you know me.
she's unbelievable. who needs satellites when we've got dolores's mouth?
oh, sure.  here, this can be mommy.
still is, so let yourself out.
and dieter.
hell yes.  we don't care about the mark.  he deserves what he gets.
twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
leave me alone.
no. it's all right. i'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
would have been nice to catch that game though.
he knows you shattered his violin.
well, it's kinda a strange time right now. things are kinda -
it's not fair!
sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
have you told him what's happening?
hello. wendy.
let me know when you've identified him
that was nice of you.
perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
jeffrey. are they important things? well forget me - you have to tell him. jeffrey. i mean it.
no. you screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. you never gave a shit about me.
where is she?
just give reed a little more time. you know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
...of possibly working together.
come with us, daddy. please come with us!
why did you, then?
alright, i'm . . .  no way . . . is this a joke?
all right, thelma...that's it. i've had it.  you can call your good friend joanna kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  i mean, i don't know what i did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
you fucking nuts?
i expect some kind of loyalty here. just because i fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
you were little jesse james when you left.
what do you want?
me!
i heard you. but i'm choosing to ignore you. epps, let's go.
yeah. we were just passing out guns.
mister funboy lives there?
hello, charlie -  i didn't know we were speaking.
oz.
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a saturday night. that's also fun.  i came to see selma, as a matter of fact.
thanks.
but in your profession that is a risk.
it's not about being fun.  it's about being smart.  you take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. ever.  that's freedom.  that's what i'm talking about.
oh, you mean the suit.  harry kept all my old clothes.  fits okay, but it's a little big.
why aren't the enterprise transporters in operation, mister scott?
julian, you're fired.
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore.
no, no, no, i told you. they're fine. they're all real happy.
you won't let him touch her?
is there anybody in the navy you don't know?
move! or you die right here!
twelve monkeys, honey.  guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
sure. what is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
then i can't be hurt anymore.
well, romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
right now.
okay, then ... i just go to the marriott and i'm set ...
maybe it's supposed to end now. maybe god wouldn't have it any other way.
what did you to do him, michael? why did he bite you?
your back? did you fall?
twelve years in prison?
sid. you must be a very important executive.
believe it or not, you're safe here. the judicial police will kill you. if they can.  this page?
don't "sir" me-- you have no idea who you're dealing with.
"you'll be burned out/or smoked out/an' come back to me, i know..."
otis...
one more time would be nice.
oh, that's been there for two hundred years. we were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
be careful.
shirley and i come here regularly. i love romantic lingerie.
come, patsy.
as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.
always.
i could never move - i've got too much stuff.
i'm sure he'll forgive you.
and we're going away for a holiday.
well it's a last minute change.
weren't you afraid?
that's right.
uh-huh.
just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... how you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
it was alive?
you know my back.
oh, cornelius, show some strength!
yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  they just jack off to clint eastwood.
tell iris all about it.  take good care of mrs. finley, iris.  beckett, come in.
no, they're just powder burns, thank god. they were empty. get her upstairs.
mrs. stanwyk, may i borrow this picture. i promise to send it back to you. it's routine, really. the actuarial people need to --
all right, you said i was fired. well, i quit! give the assignment to somebody else. 
don't do this.  don't psychoanalyze me.  i hate squid.  period.  just like you hate jellyfish.
i don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after christmas.
it was lying where on the balcony?
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  here.
oh, you will?
have you ever been married, miles?
doctor, i hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
who put the big hurt on...
lemme see.
should i slap him?
c'mon!
how about over there...that empty memory?
in a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
if i tell them, they won't follow me.  you know that i am right, father.  you trust me...
what's good about that?
there wasn't any way to explain it.
for starters. it's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
that was you?!
what a gyp.
some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
oh, uh...i don't remember too much...
maybe the romaris might have a room. they seem nice.
because you can't, i know, it's preordained.  so sorry.  i forgot.  jon.  this, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
whatta' you whinin' about? he said i'm next.
tell me what?
well, what does it matter to you?
can the professor repair his own mind?
what are you gonna do anyway?  you won't get your money back.
what?
don't be long, ellen.
yes, sir.
you moved into this block?
just 'cause i'm not like little miss honor roll here--
i don't know, but the british are excited about it, i know that. the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich.
just call me barney.
speaking of which. i saw you talking to ronnie this morning. why can't you get it back together with her. you've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
she's out with a friend.
well, thank you.  anyway -- time for bed.  or... sofa-bed.
is that a question?
yep. finally. i love you, jez.
sure.
if it worked, yes.
i don't know what you mean.
hey, murph.
aaaahhhh!
i don't know nothing about it.
i'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  you are okay, aren't you?
i don't know.  but i'm sure i'll find out. rose, you did me solid.
well, hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
no. munich's a bust. he's loose.
you'll be missed.
i turned it off.  it's like an open window he can climb right in...
cure!? ha-ha-ha!
what about the notes?
what'd he think it was to you?
a few days ago.
right through those doors.  the man himself.
stuckey!  he wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
halfway 'round the world.  so that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
yes. i have a long ride ahead of me...  goodbye.
i also have this odd pain in my mid section. kind of a hollow feeling...
we're aware of your position.
go on to the house...
fine, i'll go by myself then...
i guess...some of them are probably faking.
what's he doing there? teaching?
you're still late.
my lord?
no. i'm just procrastinating.  people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  come on.
what?
no, we'd never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
you'll see!
fuck you man!  you don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
for who?
so i come to england with other actors to make shows, i meet this freak from novgorod i tell him of you and chicken and the birthday here we are.
course i like him, i like pizzas to but i'm not gonna marry one.
telly is at steven's?
it's very late.
but alas poor romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter tybalt?
you not with probation, one of those?
when i grow up, i'm going to go to mhravitch.
i need someone with your kind of background.
lindsey!  wait a second--
it was nip and tuck.
dead... they're dead... and buried.
i've always said the one reason i'm the best detective in the industry is that i'm the only one... but hey, i never throw away a clue...
i don't know.
i'm just making our intentions clear. go check the desk.
she drank liquid oxygen.
which i told barnes was attacking --
no! letters. i've got to write to the rangers and ma--and--i'm bustin' with news! why, i've introduced a bill! me--jeff smith. i got up and talked in the senate! 
hello.
what character?  i'm candy, the chick who gets killed second.  i'm only in two scenes!
yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
well, dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. they've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. i caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
wait a minute--i think i can cut something else out.  "back in four weeks." instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--that saves another word.
we'll transplant it. to the forest.
if i owe, i will go.
maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
don't be silly. he's perfectly tame.
forget it. he'll be back here. they've got no proof.
you don't?
...a monstrosity!  who would do that?
i'm not telling you.
i guess it depends on what you give up on.
first, the money.
yes, we've been through death and life together.
yeah.
thanks for the invitation, but i have my own apartment.
are you free tonight?
shit! shit!
i know and i'm honored...
trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. you couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket.
boy! you writers! work hard, play hard!  that's what i hear, anyway...
hey, woody!?  where'd ya go?
a sponsor.
elizabeth. my more than sister.
....hi.....
what?
if you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
oh, yeah. for real, point-five.
now get this, gallagher - smith. that's the name.
someone who's sick of living off scraps. the coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  when the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
louis, put me in my coffin...
yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
nobody's better with evidence. but he has the other thing, too. he doesn't like that part of it...
you know the other day i really wanted your reaction to how we did with the libyan report -- i was going to ask but i guess i feel a little intimidated with you.
i'm sorry, sir, but as far as i'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
there's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
we have found immortality, you and i. you must not be afraid.
women!  can't live with 'em.  can't live without 'em!
huh uh. a jockey. his name's, um, curtis... curtis hardapple.
john ultramalensky?
that signal. it's a countdown.
jimmy's father is on the phone.  i wonder if you'd take the call.
she has never mentioned her family.
oh no you don't! this is my fight!! i don't need your help, alan dershwitz!
otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you. tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  right, otis?
well, i don't know how you got a ticket for --
bruce, you can't.
hi.
well, t.j.'s... seniority... and all.  i'll talk to garber about it.
hey, my friend!  i'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
any ghosts in here?
do you want i send it to your room?
unfair. you are completely unfair.
we've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
not so bad yourself.
he's got exposure.  he sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
what? palace? hardly.
i fell in love last night -- the real thing.
that's not proven, 655321. in fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
if we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
no, i don't hate it.
you're pretty black to be growing up in rossmore park.
are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
it's mine.
then why are you smiling?
way to go, karl. we got a touchdown. that was a good lateral, man. that was just like the wishbone.
like i said... it was a slow night... i'm sorry. it was hard to score.
you take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
fine!
so if i gave you my life, what would you do with it? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? or could you change? could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? a father's words you never heard? could you do that?
jeez... that sounds awful. hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
of course i mean it! i don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as i can get her back. 
honey, some crackpot.  martin luther king was killed in memphis today!
what say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
we're working on it.
some of rhodes' men. at the door.
yes, she is.
what's average?
how do we do that?  make a buy?  that went well...
that's not true.  it's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... i'm indebted to you for everything... it's just...
abort? reed, i put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and i will not let you make me look like a fool --
i don't want your help.
that little prick.
i'm sure it's all right.  my friend max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
yes.
i'd like to get out of here.
what else?
thank you.
hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
i think that frank wants me to go to this woman.  she wrote a book about time travel. frank asked me if i believed in time travel. that can't just be a random coincidence.  my dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
daddy, do you think missy dandridge went to heaven?
still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. never seen anything like it.
what?
that!
yes, thank you. thank you very much.
not so long.
you've stabbed me, man.
jeremy if you pull that trigger i'm going to leave! i'm going to go to new york.
seven-ish
what?
so, five hours.  plenty of time for a call.  he was 'excited', you say. in the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
i kinda thought so. felt like it.
sure, he's "the bodhisattva".
what?
because he's probably dead. his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. see, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch prom night they'd save time. there's formula to it. a very simple one. everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
fossils.
what is?
you must, betsy. they'll have to believe you.
cereal.
oh. i'm sorry. gideon, what do you say?
fine. fine.
i know.  do you think if something happened, it happened there?
it doesn't work?!
who's thorwald?
let's be honest. have we anything like it in russia?
you could do worse.
why does that sound silly?
then you won't like this one.  it's a piece of shit.
a truck? you're doing this for a truck? that's insanity.
but what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
we learn by doing, lieutenant.
okay.  all right, man.  okay.
i've missed a step.
but she must be able to move. everything is in place.
dig the square wardrobe!
so after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
i'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, anna, and just say thank you.
i am from outa town.
you're a silly girl.
yeah, i know.
i'm glad you do.
the usual things. i'm a flight attendant with cabo air.
what do you think?
...you told the desk sergeant you were certain mr. kim wasn't the killer?  you left your telephone number?
there are things you didn't tell me.
yes.
you ready on shore?
where's my cat?
we can get blood type right away. dental records will take longer.  you want dna, that can take weeks.
she said, "will it change my wife." you heard that because you were there so i'm not crazy.
oh darling, of course it would. if it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, mother will give us the blue room too, i think.
but i know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
what's got into that cat?  well if you do see him, tell him i've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
it's not impossible.
i'm not looking for a tape.  what i need is --
but why?  we raised you as a jew.
wow ! santori and zegema beach, i've always wanted to go there.
i - ran away...
every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
no, acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. it just means i can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the top-of-the-mark. but --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.
hmmm...
i know he left you behind.
it gives me a great sense of danger. we have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
mumble ... tuttle ...
excuse me?
dirty night.
excellent!
this guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
you going to tell him?
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie, too?
you left your back wide open.  freeze could have killed you.
oh, yes!  you live near here, don't you?
i'm working on it.
after we've looked, we'll talk.
why, are you famous?
about what?
well, look, i don't claim to be an expert--
it's not your fault.
it will be perfectly all right, walter. mother is coming with us on the train.
what radio?
yes, the redoubtable paul.  he has the plantation, and i, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
didn't i tell you to knock before you came in here?
yes, that's good. until he meets
then they lost?
what's up, dixie chicken?
i couldn't believe it! i didn't think she was going to die. i knew she was sick...
shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
something about tampering. some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the r&d budget into his checking account, i don't know. why are you so interested?
good, it was all right.
he's... he's dead.
wanted to see how good you were. i'm hoping we might work together.
for how long?
ok.
sorry, i'm all booked up...  come, m'dear.
i will.
come one will. i just want to know.
oh. i don't know. i was just... i don't know. i was... you seemed nice, so --
deathly afraid of it. her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
we've fused into a major series, ross. this girl isn't the second victim. this is "jennifer <u>eight</u>."
yeah... let me think about it.
great.  really.
you did?
naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
you know i'm scared of heights.
well they always is to the party concerned.
my greatness is better demonstrated with this.
come here, farrah...
perhaps.  but of d'artagnan i am certain.  what he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his king.
too late.  just my luck.
so now you've got to talk him out of it. and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
huh?
what's to think about?
how long they been livin' here?
like most things, i am nothing. it's the same for this sword.  all of it is simply a state of mind.
no, i don't want to leave now. i'm having too good a time... of course i'm coming!  you'd think you're gonna leave me?
my husband...
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? you said the place isn't finished.
what a fine boy you have, jabez. how old is he now?
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
twenty five?
no, he didn't.
i met dr. kent, once.
we don't know that.
baltimore. pure city-dweller.
then you better start swimming.
well, i ain't upset about it, darlin'. just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
i wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
i am sure.
i love you.
yes?
no, actually i was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
i wanted you back.
i'm going to class.
carmine left?
you betcha.
yes. the pressures you feel, and again, i am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. so stop the tom foolery -- the shenanigan's, will.
no. i should have. i told them i disagreed with you, mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original. i'm not lying for you. i'm not gonna shut up for you. not on any of it.
give me that.  i'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
i love your sister, mary. i love her very much.
this... seemed best.
the climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
i don't know what happened to him. he just ran out into the streets.  i got some old records i want you to hear. i like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. when i was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
and you say he doesn't remember any of it?
wood?  ward?  wood.  hey, what do you know.  it <u>is</u> wood. dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  right?
you mean besides kicking your ass?!
it's for the pick-nick. and you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
are you afraid?
you haven't even driven a car since you took office.
i've never been more sure of anything in my life.
ha. he was building his fucking porch.
sort of.
the bridge of death? ... which leads to the grail?
i don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the first national bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
i don't think there's any hope, either. i was just trying to make you feel better.
then do me a favor.  if the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  i want you to cure me.
yeah.
you only think i guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! i switched glasses when your back was turned. you fool.
they're all good ones.  satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam's ass.
oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! this isn't my "great second chance", osborne. everyone thinks i'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. nobody will ever know what happens here --
you got me.
what?
they've left, keep watching!
i'd slap his face.
shrink, actually.
i said you win.
maxie knows i don't go near drugs. i did a minute in quentin for possession with intent. and it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
i think you're right.
not if i kill you first ...
yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  now they want to do the same with theirs.
do peter sellers again.
--i've completely forgotten where it was, except i know it wasn't her apartment.
yes, sir.
four.  you're great with these kids.
if you like -- just hurry!
nope. my father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
in this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
this afternoon.
maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
i am a suicide risk.
i dreamed about your house last night.
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  the rex.  ever been there?
no.
but they'd still get the idea, right?
what are we doing?
oh yeah?
we can't jump from here or at this speed. but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
well then, take a seat everyone. betty why don't you join jimmy and we'll play the scene. is there anything you'd like to say bob... something to betty before they begin?
is what you?
all of us.
yeah, i know.
leave.
scared of a girl?
yeah.
now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. nothing. no substance behind it.
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
i can give you five. you didn't do very much to these.
it'l be alright.
she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. that hasn't been made public yet. we don't know what is means.
just an expression...  what i meant was... i'd do just about anything... to get away.  wouldn't you?
then it must be a helluva idea.
no.
i can't do it.
the enterprise. i must check in before your inspection. and you?
i guess it's pretty tough work at that.
i lost you.
yes it's me!!! frank is on his way up to dorothy's apartment.  oh no. frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  detective williams. hurry. i'm in the apartment. hurry. i'm hiding in the back bedroom.
i love you.
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there. also i enjoy history.
you worked at one time as foreign service trainee in the state department.
i ain't mad at you...
you think i wouldn't remember a thing like that?
what for?
so you know krylov!
we know who stole the missing item. if the thief returns it, i'm sure sir te will pursue the matter no further.
not possible..
well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
yes.
but i understand her. that may be more important.
aye, that's joe. he... ummmm, lives here now. the lodger. that's what he is... he... he rents your room. alex confronts joe.
what does that mean?
i wish you'd...
thanks.
never could save a thing.
no.  it's one of j.j.'s occasional beau gestes.  evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
the police?  we'd never live to testify. not against spats colombo.  wabash 1098.
aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
of course, your highness. nevertheless... cure the marquis de sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
no.
hey, angela, sal and i go back a long way.
what about you?
what's wrong, stephen?  c'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  how's brian doing?
that's deep.  but before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
right now it's on the balcony.
objection.
anyway, last time i checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  and i know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so i'm just saying.
micheal get a grip.  what did you tell her?
well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
gimme a break. you buy bluestar airlines yesterday. today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. you must have esp. a real nostradamus.  jesus christ, what are friends for?
hey, i tried the board.
it will.
sure it is.  freckle face, if i ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  i'd catch hell.  and this is the alleged murderer of the president?
especially with an election coming up in a few days.
cool.
don't screw around with me. you know what i'm talking about.  you're taking those sats. you're taking those sats or your cd collection is history. you're taking those sats and you're going to college. you're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
he... he is dead!  my husband is dead!  call my parents. they’ll tell you. call them!
oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now, if i chose.
thank you. whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
you've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  y'knowwhati'msayin'?
all right, forget it.  tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
i...i just need to know what state you're in so i know...how to talk to you...how to act...
they told me they don't help out stalkers.  look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
but you're not.  you're somewhere else.  you're someone else --
we talked.
somehow i feel safer in here.
i'm not painting the fu --, i'm not painting the ashtray. and frogs aren't purple.
having second thoughts?
aah!
is white an expression of innocence? do you crave innocence leslie?
you're telling me that, i should take my daughter to a witch doctor? is that it?
i don't want you to be sorry, alan, i want you to be excited.  i want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  you know why?
honey, i told you.  if it makes you happy, we should just do it.
made a few quid, did ya? now where is it?
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  right over my head. oh, my word! i tell you, those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
harold! that's <u>disgusting</u>!
a detective's nightmare.
i want my kid out of here now!
oh, no, i have a car.
i think you should leave now, robert.
but, rose, what is the cause of it all?
so, have you given him "some" yet? 
but they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. what we need is another body, and steven's bloody hands right next to it!
don't you want to make one?
yeah, they are.
what did she say?
captain... i'd like to go along...
what's in it?
yeah.
because i'm a newspaper woman, heaven help me!
i did steal a squirt of perfume. what do you think? it's clinique happy.
excuse me.
that’s all i wanted to hear...
sometimes opposites attract.
you're talking about committing suicide!
are you out of your mind?
right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
spanky's gonna be pissed? poor spanky. fuck spanky! what the hell kind of a name is spanky, anyway? you're responsible for this situation. i blame you for everything. if it wasn't for you, i'd be home having a hot meal right now.
hospital food.
like, this way... sort of...
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr. espastico jacobo.  that's nothing new.
i kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
no it's mom.
yes sir.
yeah, we'd better keep them for now, i'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
even as a boy i thought so.
where you know amanda from?
keys.
i'm an evolutionary biologist.  what do you do?
you heard me --
i said, yeah, you're right, chief.  as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
"we" being the behavioral science unit, at quantico. you're one of jack crawford's, i expect.
honest like al capone on tax day. where are my keys?
martin, i don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and i don't care. it was good that you left, and i'm glad you did. so what do you want to talk about? you've grown up a bit. maybe i had you figured wrong.
invisible!
can i help you?
sir, i would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. it's making my muscles tighten.
alaska.
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
ok.
all right then, we'll use your plan.
what about the gold?
and how about your co-star in nightmare i.  would you trust him alone with your child?
you mean sandro, don't you?  well, i beg of you, please, spare me that. goodbye, dad.
a pecking party?
i don't know.
yes, sir.
i already know about the riots, d'artagnan, i heard them out there whispering.  some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  i will deal with it tomorrow.
he wouldn't.
fiddlesticks!
those men are all dead.
what do you mean?
of course you don't. i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
what?! are you mentally deranged, jam?
i guess i hadn't thought through how i felt.
apipoussan!
tell me about the first time.
what?
did i say he did?
do you still...see each other?
she was torn apart! she died of a broken heart.
i'm from a small town in slovakia.  like the south here.  the police is right, a civilian is wrong.  so i fled.
i'm doing it.
finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? the "o.j." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? your "jim jones kool- aid" that was exactly that?
the aliens...in the mother ship.  you look just like him.
let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. you do it again, nobody, not rhonda, not yolanda, gonna save your ass.
you gotta plan these things.
because if you are...
charlie! i've got no one else here! you're the only person i know in los angeles...
no.
hope for the best? i don't understand all this skepticism. i thought you liked rose.
it's kind of ironic. all you guys have women troubles and i don't.
i'm afraid my people haven't.  i'm very sorry -- i wish it were otherwise.
you won't learn anything from them. they are only love letters. there are not many of them.
did you bring a check?
are we supposed to?
sorry.
i think it's time you went home, drew.
the room has a bug in it.
so, what's the story with your friend?
but we cannot be killed.
'bout five thousand.
you enjoy it?
well...
something like that.
not in the least.  after all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
the rider on the pale horse is pestilence. he follows the wars.
do i know everything there is to know here?  you fellas aren't talking with bob sugar, are you?
i know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  i can't logically explain to you why it's not. morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  i understand that now. that's why i have to go.
wha'?
you're saying no.
i know you mean well, dudley, but i don't need to do it the way you did.  or my father.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
don't worry...
then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
let's have dinner first.
what?
i wish i could be like my momma though. she always knew what was wrong. knew just what to say.
i should call the police. oh no peter. peter is the police!
sure. i'd be glad to.
i am captain renault, prefect of police.
they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.
oh yes! it is much better than what i am used to.
i'm already late.
why us?
i want to be put on this case.
always good advice.
holy christ. you want to get us killed?
yes, i am, brother minister. all i want is support for my children. he should provide for his children. that's all i want.
the pentagon.
checking..... hah ! he has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
i... i...
i'll see you tomorrow.
what you doing here?
what are you talking about?
well, sure, i guess. pop says so too. i work pretty hard at school.
what about her?  let's c ut up the money, i want to get north.
danger's my middle name.
just a second.  hello?
what?
nothing.
in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
the cure's not working, tom. maybe we should go back to the hospital.
go home!
i'm gonna take clara home. it's close to one.
you're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
listen.  you think you're responsible for everything that happens.  don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  you're not the center of the universe. you're just... peter.
well, sam, i might as well tell you the truth.  it's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. i want you to drop the damned thing.
sure.
yes.  then he said a really weird thing...
if you're free.
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand.
you don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about miss lawson, do you?
i don't think i was.
i was flying...my responsibility.
down here....
i'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. i'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her.
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
how do i stop it?
i love you, elaine.
hello summer detention.
if it has to be--do you mind if i do it myself?  oh, i don't mean with the gun. this is no trick.  when i wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  it's not so hard for me as you think. i'm not crying about it, i've been skating close to it for quite some time.  the water is cold down there--  but so is everything else.  and there's you.
glad to meet you.
dorothy!
you knew, didn't you, john?  you knew.
no. what happened?
yeah.
shep said 8:30.
hawaii. i've read all about it. i've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. oh, god. i'd kill to go there.
terrible.  awful!  i met the most beautiful girl i've ever seen in my life!
i'm gonna see you tonight...
'but i say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
sure. what do you want? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
you know you don't have to sneak. you could stay with me.  i know things, wyatt.  sweet things.  i could make you so happy.
i'm just so lonely.
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, adolf hider.
christ.  some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  they don't say why, and i don't ask.  i don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
not our kind of people, you understand.
buy us some thunderbird, man.
they went out of business years ago.
giovanni, this is faith's friend, peter.
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium - found in asia.
that must be it. it's a great smell.
what was?
has he?
wait... i just want to see what's on this tape.
referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
it would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
i won't.  and when i tell drew about it, he won't either.
saw something i didn't like.
two hundred and seventy.
you shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old nellie.
i'm the bowler.
yes.  he seeks a levy of troops and money.
gay?
meeks, you're the brain here.  what do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
there's not much illegal.
well...
yes. the first of its kind. i found this blood sample earlier this evening...
there was -- there was.
great.  god, i've wanted you forever.
oh, god, michael, i know.  why does everything have to be so hard?
how will we interrogate them?
well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
you ordered a winnebago?
cherry-red tears, your first book. i read it at least nine times.  and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
then you can go.
aha - very good, freshie.[3] very good. you'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
me, too! me, too!
in santa ynez.  and i agree with you about cab franc.
how would you have helped eric?  he needs you, paul. he needs us.
no lloyd. chicks are for fags - i'm not going to do it.
and you are?
sure...
i know.  now shut it. you say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
impossible.
i know you do, so that's why --
emergency procedures.
it was the same thing in germany. we looked for years before we found the right hitler.
i'd appreciate it. i like knowing who i'm stealing from. if you can't create art i think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? there is...  ... so much beauty.
you're alfred beidermeyer aren't you?
wayne gretzky.
i wouldn't be close to you.  what is that perfume, girl?
it appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
en route? why? we weren't expecting you for another three months. has something happened?  <u>has something happened</u>? do you read us?
as a matter of fact, i stopped by to tell you that i haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
now wait...
... hi.
a week, eight, nine days –
what?
no, what is it?
you know who it is.
exactly.
egypt!
it doesn't matter. i think about you every day.
he's not in, mr.?
come on!  six major earthquakes in the last three years?  the space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
alright, let's keep calm.  we've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
oh, shut up, rose, eat your cornflakes!
i star-sixty-nined you.  i never pick up my phone.  what's up?
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. when they founded "heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. all they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
i'm your daughter all the time, you know.  not just when it's convenient.
what kind of stories?
wendy give me the bat.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
this is the place.
say there's just one "mole" working there, like barton at the doj. how do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? or she? or the guy she works for?
do what?
fine. but only if we recover the cash.
aren't we all.
what's your eta?
no, man. i'm gonna bail.
mr. kessler?
just tell him what you know, nick! that's all they want! and we'll get out of this!
you got a better offer?
none?
how do you define <u>unwarranted</u>, <u>mister</u>?!
i want you to leave.  and never come back.
what?
who is this? what's going on?
but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... believe me, anna, words never help at all. they only serve to confuse. i love you, anna. isn't i that enough?
how did she...  ...happen to have them?
hey.
) listen, you little...
i got the tape enhanced--and i managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
not that again...
what have i done?! idiots.
that was her - the girl... we have to go.
how so?
sure...it's not that...i mean...
yeah.  i guess so.  my mom says when i'm, like, 45, i think, i send him back through time to 1984.  but right now he hasn't even been born yet.  man, is messes with your head.  where's that other bolt?  thanks.  mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, i guess.  i see her crying sometimes.  she denies it totally, of course.  like she says she got something in her eye.
he <u>has</u> been going after everything. it <u>could</u> work.  but this is not a happy cow.
i'm a working stiff, pops.
tell him i'm not here.
steve...
no, but... i don't know... sometimes.
greetings tim the enchanter!
--and the fbi confirms--what more do you need?--
no games, bodhi.  pull the cord! now!!
and heat and chemical reactions. where does it all go when you die?
just relax.
since last night. i was pleased to see you.
i know, ma, but -- suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
what'd you do?  memorize the tide tables?
yeah, like that.
climb out to where?
oh, my goodness!
i'll keep that in mind, sir.
well, i say fuck that. you need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
i'm staying pregnant, le.
well.  every time i see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. givin' me his mean face.
stop tearing me apart!  you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
not in this case. charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
you were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? your trip to aspen? they’re all panicked here...
all your life.
yeah.
does that mean that you want me to go there?
that's the way these people are. you don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
are you going to be able to sleep?
i'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security i was thinking of --  you see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
it'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the executive committee of the national security council. we'll call it excom.
no ma'am.
i don't talk about it, you know...  no offense.
it's not a rumor. it's a sale.  if tisch can unload cbs for $81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
steamed dumplings?
why the hell aren't you in school?
fine, just fine!  i'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  but it wasn't easy. my costs have tripled.
this is the front entrance, right? you get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's here to here -- lined up. what's this, the cage? cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
yeah.  everything's cool.
sister, if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell wouldn't be here.
what do you mean?
he never came home last night.  was he with you?
yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
mr. gardner, i don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
that's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
do you and michael ever talk about his work...?  about spending so much time working in the water?
aren't you coming?
yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
i'll just ask the question myself... "is jack bartlett interested in me?"
uhh... i with it sister but...
that's happening in about ten minutes. israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
no! we can't let anyone know about this thing! we gotta play ball with these guys - you ask stan grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
whoa -- wait a minute. we can't leave williams here. one of the other fellows'll --
about three.
she hears what she wants to hear, okay?
all night.
once you thought we'd never find the greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
fuckers!
why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
thank you, i can see that.  try something else.
oh.  well, yes.  it's extraordinary.  you think you could sign it for us?
i did warn you.
i'm awfully sorry.
because you are dangerous.
don't remind me.
no.
like what, mr. taylor?
yeah. sure. had me going for a while.
i gotta go. i'll see you tonight.
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
it's dave.
ain't that the truth!  i've even bad producers recut my movies --
and she began to cry.  and you put an arm around her.
good.  i have two left....
doc!
how would you describe him?
that feller last night, that's who! he was gonna stay a week, huh? well, he's skipped. took the car with him, too. we wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if i hadn't took that magnesia.  come on, get up, don't lay there. let's do something about it.
is it dead?
oh, no, i just lost a little weight, that's all.  well, you look nice.
you know you can't do that.  c'mon.
he killed me! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
for holes.
okay, miss starling?
yeah.
how can you be sure?
technically no. i gambled that you would attend the church service. i just waited for you.
oh.
it looks like he's writing everything down.
no.
frank -- it's rebecca.  i need to see you right away.  i've got the tape.
so it was.  she threw it at me.
i happen to know so.
yes, sir. yes, indeedy. everyone knows deeds.
he'll find out you took me.  i'm unprotected.  he'll kill us.  all of us.  you don't stand a chance.
ynyr!
i'm trying to figure that out myself.  i have to see machine without his mask.
seymour does.
hi, gale. i'm glad you're all right.
oh, no, i wanted to go along with you.
they say i am no good to you.
okay.
and how should we do that, sir?
what do you want?!
terrific.
where do you think you'll go?
swell. i get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
seriously. what's it like to be eighteen?
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery.  a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8.  it would be too large for the deceased's well.
did i do something wrong?
i just wanted to see her, that's all.
you sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
i didn't get the bet down in time.
what's this?
yep.  he really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  musta gone 450 feet...damn...
were there any calls?
show this to the president.
it's hairy ,though. that's where we lost mcdonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. it's charlie's point.
i know, i know, dude. oh, i must have been crazy! i lost my head completely!
ok. i'll lend you some money. let's go outside and see how much we have left.
it will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
ruiz is always on the list. he just ain't here, though.
i do mean it.  and i mean this... if faith stays you go away and never come back. you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  you understand?
what the fuck is this, jimmy?
tell me about her again.
okay, that's your opinion.  i don't agree.
if that's the way you want it.
you want company?
and to history.
so, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
well, you are!
no can do. life goes on, pointfive ... you left me, remember?
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
look we can use someone from the embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. close off his transportation.
oh, it's terrible! it's too, too terrible!  well. go on.
ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  i'm a friend of anna scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
paraffin.  your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  i saw it floating in the bomb. 
no, you get out of here.
absolutely duncan i'm on top of everything.
objection!
oh, aye, aye.
it is.  coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. we'll start in twenty minutes.
what?
is this something you're interested in?  i'm not really that person i was.
then what?
very well.  that means that you have met all mr. holland's requirements.  now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
do you think i'm a fool?
oh, i understand.
darlene, it's five-thirty.  now, i worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
we've got a lot of people looking for us. we'd just like to go home.
be quiet!
just 'cause you went to catholic school and wore a uniform.
i'm going to hit you.
raw.
of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? i think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
i don't feel that, no. i just... i'm not really who you think i am.
i think you should wear that.
i count my blessings.
when you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  but you shouldn't think about it too much.  the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
line up where you want it.
... but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase, okay? i understand completely that it's just a tv show. there is no ship, there is no beryllium sphere, no diagital conveyor... i mean, obviously it's all just a-
our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
maybe, when we get the grail...
i like you, jerry.  a lot.
as i said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
why didn't you tell me? why wasn't it in our files?
we can't leave him to repeat anything.
tell me. when will the doctor be awake?
for our sake, i hope not.
i find out now.
zoe, come say hello to your father...
to keep?
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
i'd say we're in its home.
who's paying you?
all right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
did your collaborator know?
you know, boss, this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered.
really! that's wonderful.
shit. they don't have any carrot soup.
of course i know what that is.
you think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. you think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  you think you're so hot just because you broke the ensenada tape piracy ring...
because, taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
few months perhaps. i'm gathering the raw materials even now.
no, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. a thing like that. no. sure you don't want a sip of this? it's delicious, i think.
prescription. for my condition.
that bugs you too?
we're only talking about six weeks.
and betty mayfield--
maybe twenty gallons an hour.
do what?
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  i got it...
yes, master.
it won't be that hard.
i prefer waiting for a while...  i feel it would go the wrong way.
han's leaving?
why did you kill my mother?
whose orders were those?
that's your dream, homes.  not mine.  i don't want to leave this street.  ever. the status quo is totally cool with me.
i know.
what do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
nothing. what could i do?
scare me?  no, actually, i was just scaring myself ...
okay.
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
just the name of this hospital, st. severin. he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
i guess...i don't know...i guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
implanted.
gee, thanks, mr. dickson—
and i with you... i never dreamed life held such pleasures...
laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  he's changed the world.
all right -- roby and melkonis will go with faust.  hunter and i will make up the second team.
people don't want a champion.  they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
i'll need a receipt for that.  for all these.
i don't know, diego.  i've got a good thing going already.  everybody smokes pot.  it's easy.  cocaine is a rich man's drug.  it's too expensive.
must not've been the captain's entry. he was probably out of the picture by then.
we're like his handlers. he can't function without us.
... hard?
beats me. he just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  what did you do to piss him off?
you remember buddy, don't you, richard?
there's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
i liquidated the last account in zurich, and split it into two new ones in estonia.
i answered these questions last night.
no i'm not.
taiwan.
y'mean take off our costumes?
i'm alright.  will you stay home for awhile?
then what are you saying?
it's a little late for that.
well, there's something missing in there.  there was something around her neck when i came in there, but it's gone now.
come on, man.  i almost had this thing open.
your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
what if they're carrying? did you even check?
let's go and see.  taxi!
i came from the city on the left.
what did you say?
because you're an idiot.
your call.  have a good night.
hey, i'm proud of you, kid.
who the fuck is he?
0h, shit!
andy's house.  sid's house.  what's the difference.
she's our inspiration!
yes.
ok.
why not?
mr. murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
ok. ssh. rest.
yes i do.  terri, something awful happened to that boy.  i have to find out what it was.
i've no fear of failure.  your implications are most unbecoming.
the man's an ambulance chaser ...
senator martin...! you can't trust jack crawford or clarice starling. it's such a game with these people. they're determined to get the arrest for themselves. the "collar," i think they say.
anyone else?
it’s because i’m shy, betty.  so, when are you going to leave that old corpse mr. peterson and run away with me?
laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
yeah, mine too.  is it like, y'know, normal?
we must abandon.
very--your mother?
yeah.
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
yes you do. we were calling you gay boy and you got so mad....
forward!  forward!  now reverse!
a friend of mine offered me a job here.
no.
me get heap firewater --
when i'm bein' fucked, i like to be kissed a lot.  who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  you're a city cop, where's the fbi?  this is a federal offense, i got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  you know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  now god damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
...i need to sit down.
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
nervous?  not at all!  no.  i've never been more certain in my life.  except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams.
in so far as i can tell these things -- no.  i believe the chevalier won the money fairly.
well, jay. they've been exceptionally supportive.
maybe they'll be the next dion and the belmonts.
they asked about you.
i talked to him.
i don't know.
somebody...
maybe so.  but i think we need to ask jerry about it.
one thing, mr. klaatu. suppose this group should reject your proposals. what is the alternative?
i ain't drinking hot piss with you. come on, sam.
and if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
sure. sure i do.
why would you be here?
what about that psychic, what's his name, szabo?
but...i...400 years?
hey.
mr. kovic.   we're not here about your taxes.
ninotchka, you're jealous.
deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
don't they believe in signs here?
i think you hit him, grandpa. he was limping when he ran off.
wellie well, dr. bright.  you're just in time.
yeah.
shit, lenny. what's happened to you! we've gotta get help!
of course i do.
who are you?
because i want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  i want you more now than i did that first night--  you've forgotten all that, i suppose?
and sometimes you think you don't?! well, get away then!
triad, chinese mafia. they bring people from yunan. slave labor...  reverend harry wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. no sign of him.
okay. i gotta tell you. i've. discovered some things. .anyway i have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. the first picture is this.
they shot us all, kid.
know where we're a-goin'?
well, if she looked like you -- say! my brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
right there.
what do you think, spock?
tell me what it was.
yeah. i think it's really sick.
dr. meridian...
i'm up.  thanks.
the one you decked is bunker wiess. the big one is his brother, warchild.  the other two always hang.  they think they're some kinda death squad around here.
he was a freak.  everything he did was tainted.
it's ok...
how did you meet?
oh -- that -- i found it in the closet.
consider this my resignation --
we don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. i know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
nah, that's all forgotten.
i have a passport.  i've got...  actually, it's a little complicated.
let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, bob.  forget watergate, the break-ins, the enemies list.  you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution, planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace, trying to slip lsd to jack anderson.
like me?
and think about what you've done.
hello, mollie.
our purposes.
still gonna smell it.
i don't agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! i'm embarrassed by it. before this happened -- when i'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
i know it, and it feels good.  hi, ty.
you take care of yourself...  graham.
why?
glad to see you again.
but why ?
did i?  i don't recall... i got lots of kids from that place --
we'd go to his car.
listen, jo-jo. does this mean anything to you? joan gale's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
i promised her she'd be safe.
i'm sorry if i was in the way.  it was totally impressive.  great piece.
i wouldn't live in it as a ghost. now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
how do you figure?
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
<i>mr. cigliuti?</i>
well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  it is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  she is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
don't i get a kiss?
hey. i'm a short guy. waddaya want?
what are you talking about? it's 11, i've won. with this lady.
mookie, you're fucking up.
i know, pop.
back away then.
i don't know. i mean yes, probably.
bullshit! you're bluffing!
i don't *have* any time. there's a *war*!
not dollars. pounds.
i have to go.
then it must be wednesday.
yeah. see you in the fleet, sarge. and thank you.
where did moss...?  i...
when are you going to learn?
mrs. peel ... ?
differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. for the jew, his jewishness dominates everything. even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. they're still just jews.
true.  but why?
do you find him attractive?
and she shot him i  i think that'd piss me off if i were nix.
pal, she's a big girl, you know? i'm sure she's alright.
i just saw the mayor, he said anything we...
a hiding place.
but the most interesting thing here is that i don't see the rose tattoo that i've heard about on your back.
get married all you want to, hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
we're gonna scare him?!
far right.
at one thirty my little girl is dead.
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish?
they're paying him scale.
and this - if you decide to take the rest.
i can't get enough of it.
you haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. how could you not call back?
two nights.
very deep... usually...
that's a direct order. you didn't see a thing!
seen him around.  he used to be a cop.
about an hour ago.  said he was more than happy to cooperate.
at least somebody’s using the damn thing.  i was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
a good hour. yeah.
i don’t know!  please stop yelling at me!
we won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to hawaii the minute we're airborne.
hoagie.
the good-looking one.
like each other?  they hate each other.
oh, dad, you're not old.  you'll never be old.
you didn't like her!?
yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those gibsons, baby? ooooh!
verdado where?
i've never been to florida.
what?
grace, listen to me. your body is just healing. you have to give the rest of you time as well...
so who you out sleuthin' for now?... can i help ya?
i'd sooner die than use magic!
phony, huh?
our mother can see through bags.
he was thinking of you, marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
you need a table.
no. i'm sore.
i'm writing a book on kite construction. what did you want to talk about?
i don't remember zurich.
bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
no, it has to be tomorrow. you won't get this many of them in here for another year. it'll be fine.
every day.  basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
now when i see him with shelly, sometimes he seems like the old harry.
what are you doing here?
bye, bird-brain. see ya, scotty.
and charming?
i deal with some tough customers.
i can't stay here.
isn't it, uh...
i see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. i see the man i will never be.
well, where do they hold court?
i don't have any money.
it's down the hall.
m'hm.
well, in the garage, back home, we --
i know, master, but...
they all were.
daddy, it's like i been tellin' ya --
and didn't miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
it's the only vein i know.  i tell the facts the way i see them.  and any man that knows that facts -
she made up her mind.  nothin' i do is gonna change it.
you're right. i'm sorry.  okay, let's go get 'em.
the one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
hey, i didn't steal the truck.  you...
no.  rajeev's in india.
where did he conduct?
we were just riding around.
jabez -- seems  like i've been hearing talk around. reverend harper thinks more cross corners folk oughter be in church, sabbath morning.
...what're you talking about?
here it comes....
i am not!
fuck you!
how did you know?!
keep trying, chekov. at regular intervals.
major richards said he'd call to let us know.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
we're neighbors now. you can call me sarah.
it's only our first date.
you see?  we're both innocent, nick.
hell, no. that wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. he's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  well, anyhow, you stay cool. nice meeting you, son.
and bill?
the theatuh, the theatuh-  - what book of rules says the theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of new york city? or london, paris or vienna?  listen, junior. and learn. want to know what the theater is? a flea circus. also opera. also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, indian tribal dances, punch and judy, a one-man band - all theater. wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's theater. donald duck, ibsen, and the lone ranger, sarah bernhardt, poodles hanneford, lunt and fontanne, betty grable, rex and wild, and eleanora duse. you don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? the theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. it may not be your theater, but it's theater of somebody, somewhere.
that's great, woogie, i'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
what are you doing here?
mr. hardy?
it is. it's lovely.
fuck that.
yeah -- and lednov's only lookin' for one man. me.
i said -- not exactly -- no.
is this it?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
i was the next man.
no, no, we're fine...
we seem to've come across a 211, sir.
tell me, charlie. please.
majesty, i can't...
and decent.
oh! ah, yes, doolittle. what is it?
funny.
good day.
goosed!
sorry.
alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
a man in love, completely shaken. he sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
that's-a pretty good.  i'll take a dozen of them.
he just got a call from "mr. upstairs." something's gone wrong. he's plenty hot.
it's good you want to do something, george.
i'm worried about you, robert.
what kind of problem?
sam, give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
those wimps.  it's because i use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  i told you to move those crates an hour ago.  come on guys, let's get going.
what? no, rose, jesus, no --
as, what, 'the galloping gladiator?!'
int. helicopter - day.
hole in one! you're the queen of stroke!
it empties into a sea some miles from here. that's where the cave is.
pull the cash.
for god's sakes...i told you before...nothing.  charlie, i can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
i'm fine.
do you want to talk to him?
nay, i am the very pink of courtesy.
i don't know.  i can't be alone.
i love that car.
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
no ...  have <u>you</u> ever been in vienna?
i think it looks good.
. . . and  very naïve!
it'll pass. headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
rock solid.
long ago -- before my father's father.
try weinstein's tropic hormone.
yes?
yeah, i <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
yeah.  maybe so.
no!
i hate you because you depart without kissing me. that's all.
so why would pg&e offer it?
look over there.  that's the eye in the sky room.
you stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
i don't know what i'm doing.
what's this acting class guy's name?
oh, knock it off! _ 89.
uh-huh.
wh-what do you think--
just tell me where i can find this steven reign.
-- at the <u>worker bar</u>!  you were pretty hot to trot then!
if you take anybody, please take me.
ten.  there's a lot of other places i could work.
i don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
i know, but since we're talking, i thought i'd mention it.
hi. i'm donald kimball
i've got you.
thomas welles.  nice picture.
good night daddy.
it looks like a winding route.
right.
i know that.
what the hell just happened?
munro would. but general webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  having let them go, i fear i will only fight the same men again when i move south.  and yet, i cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of france...
rosebird baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. how did we ever get by without you?
what's it so hot in here for?
storage.
elvis is still in there!  it's gonna go off!
hold it!  hold it!  i think we're taking this too fast.
i am delighted to see you, mr. daglish.
starck...
-- the fuck are you talking about?
back on earth. victor's medical facility... we're in quarantine.
slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
if they're still alive...
i see.
he told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
you're sure you're reading that right? john doe?
twenty-five by five, roll seven. and don't exceed port speed.
i just do what you tell me, auggie. you tell me to sweep, so i sweep.
no.
joe--i've got a lot of people to take care of in this state.
dylan, i was just asking eric if--
i haven't got a sensible name, calloway.
-- get this straight: i'm the district supervisor.  whatever you do reflects on me.  it wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but i'm stuck with you. you are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  mr. corbett is quite well-known in this region.  people admire him --
who says so?
well...my home "sector" was called paramus ...
my husband the hero.
go, mr. sulu.
i only just heard of conor.  i came up from catroch as soon as i could.
what does she do with herself after business hours?
she is!
i am preparing for a ball!
that's all he said.
mrs.  ansel's clothing.
you switched the charts; you tell me.
i don't know.
he doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
shee-it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i'll do, i'll go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?
he said that, too.
are we going to argue?
-- guess we know where mr. price is now.
impossible! he was dead before he entered cryo-statis. there is no possible way he could be alive.
they are.  my boy, i think you are right. everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself. you can call that fellow in from the front. i think we'll close for the night.
no, i'm serious.
i am jack's complete lack of surprise.
someoneís after me.
is it stamped?
not know.
i'm terribly sorry.
no -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
i need the job.
and the jews?
oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
what?
do it!
don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
listen, benjamin hood. i have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. one or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean i'm... i'm not just some toy for you. when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party, i just did them, that's all, because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy.
sure - sure. don't you worry. i'll take care of you.
no...
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
my little web did that?
what's your name?
it's only one picture deal.
just one question.  since dr. argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
son of the american ambassador and a banker - good enough?
no you're not –  you're glad, because now you've got a witness.  i heard the other police talking last night.  they don't seem to like you very much.
a weekend?
they stopped serving two hours ago.
why would they care?
goddamn it bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
what? what've i done?
that's why she hates me. that's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
-- you mean my chief has it.
i couldn't kill buzz. i need his help. theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
far be it for me to dispute my first officer. starfleet has always -
i abhor violence.  sergeant whitman, i hope you don't think me mad --
it's my favorite.
how extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. someday they may be scarce.
well... i... i don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
no.  you bastard. you knew they'd come back.
what's wrong, trash?
now just a minute, major--
you're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
spit from your dad?
no, just the paper will be fine.
but we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
hello, darling.
omar--
the decision is final.
you tell him nothing, emmi. if he calls again, you say you know nothing. we're gonna keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. and, god help me, with beethoven.
huh?... why don't you get a haircut, buljanoff? you all look so wintry, comrades. and why do we always keep the windows closed?  isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... look at the birds. i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. now i know why. we have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, comrades, i don't think i need you any more.
what?
i'm serious. there's nothing for you down there. it's dangerous.
yep.  looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
and mine goes with you.
uh, i'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
we met here earlier this evening.
i'm averting my eyes, lord.
so?
something i can't let go of.  you are leaving soon?
i couldn't get you in.
any sign of data, or the borg themselves?
simulates?
what the fuck is going on?
sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  why don't i just take you back to ust?
what kind of a silly thing was that to do?
hm.
how could you?! this is just like home!
so what happened, aunt theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, aunt theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how i waste money and how i can't cook, and how i'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, i spilled some milk i was making for the baby...
how can we get out?
five stories, straight down. there was no blood in the body.
hey, i'm fine.  whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant international neighbors...?
thanks.
i know what i wanted to know about keaton.
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
i don't want to leave her.  dick ...the, the ... and father laughlin, he said that it was god's will ...
you get him?
right: lovers of the world unite!
i'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
i believe you, austin. let's go.
because i can't afford it. and because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
bianca, i don't think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
okay, joe. listen—you know i've always liked you. anytime i could do you a great turn—anytime i ran into a story that looked good—i always came running to you, didn't i? well, i got one now. those wires i sent you were on the level. it's the biggest scoop of the year. i'm giving it to you, joe.
i'd be happy too, if i had such a great family.
yes.
yeah. come on—we're stopping here for the night.
it's what i've been working for.
i just copped them.  let me tell you the story of right-hand--left- hand--the tale of good and evil.
the driver was killed. i think there's a connection --
hello marge!
yeah right... you better go.
you find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
i'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
what are you trying to do to me?
i really gotta pee.
i'd need a continuance. three weeks at least.
no... i want to be confessed.
[the what?]
answer me, tyler.
wait a minute.  you watched the apple fucking-dumpling gang?!
i'm aware of my responsibilities, mister.
it must be a closet or something.
it's fine.
research. i worked the scene right into my story.  that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
i'm just here about my brother.
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off, i ran in, childs shot me, pike and mueller were dead, and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
i'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe i like brunettes --
no, you don't understand. your daughter-
no. we have ways of digging out knowledge. but it takes longer. he is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. he blames himself for what happened to the woman. and we know little of the background.
who's recruiting?
sister...
my father always degraded me.  killed my self-esteem.  and my mother was blind.
where's sid?
what is treadstone?
yeah.  guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
yes, sir. 
i'll pick you up, miss daniels. where are you staying?
we can't delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two. it would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
my stupid back.
you must reconsider this plan. phillippe is like a child, he --
well, i guess i better look for another one, then. thanks, anyway.
yeah. right.
are you related to the deceased, mr. chance?
no way.
well, i didn't know they was a secret club.
tell m'sieu giron i can't see him now. impossible!  and, jacques. dismiss the car! madame is not going. 
which one are you and which one am i?
there's albert!  hey, albert!!!
what are you sellin' 'em for? why don't we start there.
i bet you hear everything i say!
of course there is, jack. what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation? i don't think so...there has to be a grail.
what did you do to your hair?
don't start --
there's some slice american cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, i think.
passion.  of course.  find the photo of ivy after the flower ball.
um, i guess --
what's wrong with you? why are you acting this way?
excellent...excellent!
no, i'll be fine. i'm just visiting a sick friend.
ready?  we've got plenty of time.
all right then.
we might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
my god, the vice president and the joint chiefs...
yes, mr. kane.
you don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
do you want me to go...?
what do you want?
uh, no.
am i bad? i mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
that's not right.
mr. sulu, if you please.
i just say what the other person would say?
it's nice isn't it?
thank you, travis.
what is this about?
i wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so i won't care for you... i wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
they didn't have any. they don't grow in the desert.
it doesn't bother me either.
margo, i wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
would-be. i'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  the guy took off for las vegas.

sure. it sounded like a number one tune all right.
yes
but this guy you called, he's not even army --
we don't see you.
you hit a bad streak.  we've all... look at this: fifteen units mountain view, the fucking things get stole.
they own the information he's disclosing. the truer it is, the greater the damage to them. if he lied, he didn't disclose their information. and the damages are smaller.
you may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. you're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and hollywood that hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. when he flicks you away with one finger. i'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine hell.
it's open-house. no crashing involved. anybody in the hotel's welcome.
your enemy...
what about you? you haven't eaten in days. how come you're never on this side of the microscope?
...what?
sure
good night. tell me that you love me.
fine, joe.
i didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
aye, for us there is.
you?
i didn't have the heart.
that's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  a lot of people are after you, jerry.
nothing yet to cinch it.
no.
this isn't important?  the earth is our home.
i'll say a lot of things i've never said before.  it's habit.
nothing. it's just a mosquito bite.
excuse me?
his names horrace. horrace, this is ricky slade.
that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
take a drink, kid.
we've got a huge problem with the magazine, ted-baby. our readers hate it. hate it. we need to talk.
yoo hoo, bomb...
sure.  that and a pair of testicles.
okay, yeah, call.
nothing.  nothing at all.
who cares?
good.  how long will it take?
no. what…?
what choice?
there's just no way the mets will lose this game. gooden is pitching and strawberry is ready to break out.
yah, it's good. no pike yet, but it's good.
happy anniversary.  you're a good match, you two.  can you help me with this stuff?
pair'a nines.
but, but that was before we started sharing stuff. before i told you how i cried when peepers died. i never told anyone that before.
three blocks down. get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. i'm going up the block.
what evening?
but she must want to stand.  she must want to walk.
get it while you're young.  and you better fix your lips.  you want to look nice for osgood, don't you?
federal bureau of investigation, ma'am. we know all, see all...
that's if the war is even still going on. way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
left them at the office.
toys for... adults?
keep it up.
i couldn't sleep... i should get going; i feel really weird...
why not?  memento blue revisions - 8/27/99
well...
in case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
well what shall i swear by?
i'm fine...  see you...
she doesn't answer me either.
fifty cars. fifty cars by 8 am friday. or kip goes in that box. that was the deal ... goddamn, it ... that was the deal ...
i like this music.
well, that's very kind of you -- only i'm not feeling well -- you see, i have this cold -- and i thought i'd go straight home.
i threw it away.
i wasn't told. i just knew it.
i overheard him with the girl.
so where's plissken?
you sound so sure.
no.  i've got you.
they got a sign on him in front of greely's?
how about art.
follow me.
look, if you're going to be like that... you should be appreciative that i'm interested.
oh, you mean of bonnie and clyde?  hm. you ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  you could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
don't make me do it, man
good! how is the patient?
ladies would be elsewhere.
you brought the cameras here!
hey, all right.
i'm the captain of this majestic ship.  it goes where i take it....
except for small eyes.
you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
well, it was nice seeing you.
sure, sure, it's a tough course. well thanks for coming, kid. i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the hud.
why?
look, that's the bag she came out with. she never even put her hand in it, and neither did i.
i'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
who?
i'm not the pig you are.
there's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. i'm sure this is the worst of it.
what?
i'm sorry.  i didn't do it!  can i still have my dog?
not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. honest.
what would a truck stop be without beer?
not in years.
c'mon -- what?
don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
oh, that's too bad, teresa...
you are, aren't you?
i know the feeling...
if any!
mine say stuff like "lloyd, see you around maybe"
hey ..
if we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
you believe that? and you call yourself a reporter?
you want your gear? here you go.
you need help.
yes, so we were informed.  however, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
he did, but... i think i can change his mind.
he's looking for something. won't stop until he finds it.  sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
is that still lingering?
um-huh.
but how did you get here? what are you doing here?
they've got my amado.
oh shit....oh shit...
it couldn't possibly interest you.
oh my god!
reaction to what?
and don't forget. i have the key.
will and deanna joining the titan. dr. crusher going to starfleet medical...
hurry up and get dressed.
i do, too.
frank -- what are you doing here?
who're you kidding? you can so.
nothing at all?
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6, which must have been a spare.
of course not.  but -- how can i be efficient in the office if i don't get enough sleep at night?
what's your name?
no, what is the thing?
play a song then
praying.
i just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
this is prince imhotep, high priest of osiris.
i'm here, honey. i'm right here.
i'm sorry already.
how'd you know it was us?
where are you going?
i'll take her with me to the university tomorrow.  i can't believe i read the test wrong.  i didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
that's because ms. heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
so... here is the famous jeanne... savior of orleans... terror of the english?  you look pretty ordinary to me...
fine. i just go along, you know. down at the market. back here. i mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... are you sure you're all right? i mean, what about the wound?
why would they be illegal?
no kidding -- wait till i tell linnea. who?
it's a wonder you aren't. i'm amazed, eric. i barely lasted 30 hours. you lasted eight weeks.
-- this play means a lot to me.
--into the <u>black</u> <u>hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
doesn't surprise me. i meet a lot of people like that.
i think i know her.
stay out of this, jenny.  we got man's business to take care of. i ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
he's gone?
wussup, victor.
if that's what it takes.
did you... did you... ?
no one believes the guilty. besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
rex won't be any different.  it'll come.
san francisco's changed. the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast.
i'm afraid.
perhaps the general's glasses can reach to the hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of webb...?
whoa, jim.  maybe.  but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
it's tragic. you never go out. you must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
yes, sir. i had to go to the bathroom.
i'm going out with greg tomorrow.
and you believe him?
a record of the arrests...
i'm not bugging you. come and lie down. i'll give you a massage.  where'd you go today?
so, that's it. i'm out?
are you all right?
well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine.
i know, i know.
bless you.
why; naturally, i—
it did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
what about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
i don't pretend to know.
look, dad, there is no fucking way -
we already have black soldiers in our army...
wouldn't know what to do with it all --
you know who it was and you know you aren't, and i mean are not gonna see him ever... end of story.
cause there's this guy. my brother knows him. might be right up your alley.
dirty business we're in sometimes.
you wouldn't understand.  how was miss caswell?
that's right.
she admits it's her fault.
yeah -- that's me. the happy idiot -- a million laughs.
i left a fingerprint! you fucking people.
can't argue that.
i'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. that means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. either way, i cannot have a man like that workin' here.
you're such a retard!
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar. why?
when the lock is broken -- yes.
number two. i saw the yellow man come out. this time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. number three. now get this. in the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
he's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  as important as the mona lisa.
i ain't said i'm ashamed.
well.
and i was wondering.
i...
jack, wait...
iíve got a shadow.
you need help.
he's dead...?
i'd kill him. him and that redfield woman. together. first one then the other. and then i'd laugh.
you're a wimp.
why didn't you give a warning signal?
it'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
as i said, he isn't italian. besides, i thought they just killed them.
i know. it was perfect. [beat] erase my sanity and you erase anything i'll ever say.
he's after me.
...okay...
suzie?
i'm just doing some christmas shopping. it's for my wife, no kidding. though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
well maybe for you.
who's your decorator?
two hundred bucks?? are you crazy?
please open the door, danny.
try barney clark.
what are these?
i told you what i want.
you win. it's--clarissa.
why's that?
ohhh. what's hari-kari?
now i'm going to have to kill you.
with a face like this?
that's sick!
she's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
i see.
jesus, jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
dixie mccoy didn't.
if i wasn't, this wouldn't work. now once i deliver i'll have to trust you.
you do?
fucking do. i had him all over me.
there's nothing to forgive.
i can't later.
aye, sir.
you're the spawn of satan. you got it in you.
not a whole lot, bob.
cramps?
are you an fbi man?
delly?  in here.
fine.  i'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
well, come on, you two.  time to go to bed.
i don't know, i'm afraid.
who are you?
they're inured to it.
qu’est-ce que tu veux?
it's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
yeah.
where?
i don't know.
don't worry.  you haven't seen the last of us.
but why did you want to?
kids eat that kind of stuff in korea.
i was going to let you out, eventually, cassius. i swear.
the final countdown.
we need to talk.
what-- we already talked to her.  that's a dead end.
nobody ever said it.
i told you.  i'm out of the cops and robbers business.  retired twenty years ago.  i've been trained as a bus driver.  got a whole route planned and everything.  even nailed down the lingo - '<u>exact change, please</u>'.
well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
what are you gonna talk about?
you planning on sleeping out there?
i'm a deserter, too.
can't land ... you'd kill people ...
what?
these people, my people, i want my people.
i'm about to go into the shower, i won't be able to hear you...
underneath.  somewhere.
none of this stuff was here in 1962. the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
no, sir--
hmmm. you say he showed you his garden?
ed? how many people live here?
so your memory's coming back?
have a seat.
i'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  and, i accept.
i can take care of myself.
"fucked me."
fine, my boy, fine, fine.
yes...
i bet you fucking know!
we got russian subs creeping around.  shit! something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  give our folks medals, know what i mean?
wrong.
yeah.  but i got my bike.
when i have fifty pounds.
it's bob's, the day manager's.  he's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
and what is his most cherished possession?
let's go.  pull 'em out.
it's all a goddamn fake.  like lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  and you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what i'm trying to say--
the way i look at it, i've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
yes.
i'll go in with a team. but first i'm going to need some intel. i'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. one of their own.
that feeling won't last long.
what?
i don't care.
outpost was his baby, sure. on the other hand, we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites. personally.
no, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
of course i am.  now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
i'm trying.
i still say this is my tag. any objections, hoffy?
well...?
ha... no, mr lombard. his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
yes, you. we're looking for our room... 1002.
i guess not.
thanks. i will.
where are the men without skin?
it was that painting.  the one on the wall.
i came to get you! what do you think?
this was your garden?
put that on your political resume.
my parents are laid out in the library. their skin smells like talcum powder. i'm so small. my father's diary is on his desk like always. i'm opening the book. reading. i'm running out into the storm. the book is in my hands. i can't hear my screams over the rain. i'm falling...
i know.
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum.
i used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
let me get this straight. a brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. you see a pattern here?
you are talking to him.
that's the whole point. they rarely work out. but on occasion they do. and when they do, they do big.
yes.
who would want to do such a thing as that?
i know, i know.
she won't be here for a half hour. think you can stand it that long?
eleven a.m. they're gone.
you have to answer for santino.
why?
once i wanted five grand --  cash -
that's a good question.  as nietzsche said, "whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
have they said anything about our area?
he keeps asking me questions about you. do you know him?  do you recognize him?
no, mr. kane.
green?
are you taking them still?
i don't know.  paper.  is it? paper?  i don't remember.
i'm okay. it's okay.
then let him go and he'll follow you.
i don't know...somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
the dark inside me.
like disposing of their wives?
i want this box rigged with a beacon!
no?
it makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the white house? each new member of the president's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon.
you think i didn't know what you were doing?
yes, that mulwray, mr. gittes. and since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that i haven't hired you to do anything. certainly not spy on my husband. i see you like publicity, mr. gittes. well, you're going to get it.
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
were, doss <u>were</u>.
by coveting my property. i cannot shed blood in her house but i will cut your throat anon. you have a name?
my father was an electrician. already forgot that?
beat it out and get hold of some guys.
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
hold on, son...who's this colonel greenhill you're talking about?
as much as you used to?
steam.
i'll never give up.
what kind of vacation?
were you thinking of personally driving me back east?
ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
yeah?
get off this ray, now.  if there is any evidence here, it's for homicide.  you get an id, you call me.
you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. o'neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... i have major news to announce.
look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
you bet, terrance!
why don't you two stick to reality.
it wasn't me. it was him.
right! summon the musicians! we'll do the one that goes "tum-tum-tum- tum-ti-tum-tum"
let's have lunch!
jackie treehorn trashed the place. wanted to save the finder's fee.
they're not my pals--
right! just between as and the security forces.
you're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
no, neo.  that's not true.  it can't be true.
anne vicksey didn't own a dog.
yeah, rock particles.  dust.
you two have so much in common.
<u>hello</u>.  what?
it can be captured, sometimes.
what's the matter with you?
no, sergeant -- not history...  eternity...
well, give a couple of minutes ...
nice machine, auggie. where'd you find it?
but not you. not with my misery. remember, ian did ride for dr. cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. misery was buried in the ground at the end, paul, so you'll have to start there.
you know i think that if you let me, maybe i could help you have more fun, you know? i mean, i know it's hard and... yeah.
at least tell them i'm trying!  tell 'em something--!
of course, it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
don't you ever heat that stuff up.
monday.
good.
what about before that?
now, here's how it's gonna be, lydia. you're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what i got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... i don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
yes i have, and do i look like a happy man? was all that drama with brenda a happy thing for me to do? huh? was it? is she a part of my life now?
but they did take place?
i'm gonna be an acrobat when i grow up.
uh, huh.
you have rope?
you lived like this once.
what are you doing in here?
what?
what?
you doing a story on this guy?
fun?
then don't.
well, yeah, i just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
money.
oh rachel!
her. that look. she likes the ed guy better than she likes the brother.
who says i'm the one that called it off?
the crew? could they still be alive?
--melodramatic?  things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city.
happy birthday.
something like that. cigarette?
did sidney tell you about it?
obviously, for precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  after all, what good is a justice system that instills doubt?  it may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
brady! come with us.
a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, i should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
jesus christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
and die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
scully -- listen to me. i'm going home, then i'm booking a flight to dallas. i'm getting you a ticket, too.
i'm not really hungry after all.
for the artistic effect.  the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  it's quite striking.
no, i mean we can't leave without you - we don't know where the hell we are!!
i know that. but i'm --
hey now!  no cussing on tv!  well in closing i'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  one is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
maybe i don't want to leave. maybe i want to talk.
next week.
you helped set up my partner, sergeant william wade.  i want to know who put you up to it.
herr sommer.
so what do we do?
you will protect me as you always have, d'artagnan.
the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, mr. appleton.  we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
in this heat?  they're up now.
yeah. every episode ever.
i don't know -- but i'm not afraid to try.
well, i'll see what i can do about it.
i wouldn't read too much into it.
gimmie a minute.
forget me, forget what i did for you. don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. get it?
jane, jane, jane, jane, jane...
is he all right, papa?
no!
my life is over.  go.
yes, i believe so.
walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named eddie solomon i used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
how do you happen to know her?
what kind of person?
i told him it wasn't ready...
it acts as a...
if he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  we fucking had this game.
i don't know what you mean, sir.
mimi?  ...  oh, dorothy's mother.  does she have to be up to something?
i told you, i have a feeling...
okay.
there's thousands of units like this one.
all of it.
do you really love me or are you just saying that?
he'll have it good. some day.
how could you do this to me?
me?
i don't know. i better get off now.
who was it answered the phone?
dismiss the company.
what's funny?
because my mom gets the bill.
shut up! first you come waltzing into my life after two years. you're married. you killed a guy.
actually, magneto helped me put it together.
he likes the quiet. they were here last week.
look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  it's the only thing i know.
i do.
i'm hip. but you know, i'm comfortable here. it's easy work. i know what i'm doing. everybody who works here is my buddy. i'm friendly with most of the customers. i just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
you're a tourist.  i saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
you don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
where are you off to young lady?
that's a bozo no-no.  jay-bird.
plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
hello, neo.  do you know who this is?
well that's stupid. this is my park just as much as it is theirs. you think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
do you have an appointment, sir?
what i was afraid would happen. the stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
they ain't the only ones.
you see, from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
i breathed!
bullshit.  why would mars do that?
thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you fucker. 
what?
the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
the fucking studio butchered it. it was 1937, hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  anything to avoid losing the german market.  they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. the picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  for which i was blamed.
i can't watch this.
hello. this is mr. dorchester in records. we're looking for kathy costello...
yeah, but at least i knew rome was gonna be there when i arrived...
yeah, i went down on a few guys...
must we again hear these heretical rantings?
what do you think we're gonna do? he's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
kiki - he won't hurt you. there's nothing to be afraid of.
what is it, rakonin? did you lose your job?
i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle. and he should know. he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
talk?  about what...?  oh!  about who you are and all that?
not far, not far.  be patient. soon you will see him.  why wish you become a jedi?
big subject with me, yeah.
why not?
it's time for drastic remedies.
thanks. so long, hildy!
oh, you remember my name do you?  you happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
to be frozen.  to never change.  a life of perpetual ice-olation. there is little perfection in that.
i'd like that.
i'll bitch slap you into bangkok.
they might be at the house.  keep trying and let me know.  i'm going to be here a little while longer.
all right, you guys, shake hands.
what!
i have no time to argue, gillian. or even tell you how much you've meant to us... the <u>frequency</u>.
we'll be very sorry to lose you.  perhaps i could take you to lunch today?
that's three. nobody should have more than one talent. okay, do an impression.
time for bed, kiddos. say goodnight.
i told you i'll get in trouble.
doesn't what make me...?
a writer? what do you write... letters an' such?
beth, i can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how i've always felt about you... call me jam. it's my band name.
yeah.
hmmph. at least now there's one person around here who doesn't think i'm crazy.
has he hinted around?
no matter what you say to me salvatore, you are my bambino.
what, they beat you with a rubber bat?
now, anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
my home is here.  with you.
menthol, regular, ultra-light.
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  he's an attractive man.
it'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
i'm not gonna sit here and debate. i will say this though: what shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
the drowning woman.  anne... but it was too late.  her little girl was already gone.
so if i asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...michelangelo? you know a lot about him i bet. life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. but you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the sistine chapel. you've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. and if i asked you about women i'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. but you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. you've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. and if i asked you about love i'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. known that someone could kill you with a look. that someone could rescue you from grief. that god had put an angel on earth just for you. and you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. to have the love be there for her forever. through anything, through cancer. you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. and you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. i look at you and i don't see an intelligent confident man, i don't see a peer, and i don't see my equal. i see a boy. nobody could possibly understand you, right will? yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. you must know everything about me. you're an orphan, right?
it -- she --
okay, i understand and i promise i won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...look, come inside and talk...just for a few minutes.
may i just do that, majesty? show you how it begins? just that?
yes, and very beautiful.
i know a lot more than that
what are they?
well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
you hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
hi, jimmy.
go to hell!
that's where your talent lies.
well, what, then?
maybe you will after you've thought it over.
bill didn't say - but lloyd was beside himself. he listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
brush her. listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
you're mad.
if those corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  all we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  how's that sound to you, skipper?
dammit shermin. earlier you were asking for help. what's changed?
hey -- you believe what you want. shu kai kim is innocent.
oh gracious no. not with his blandishments.
right.
you asked.  now, will you tell me something?  george and gracie's transmitter. what's the frequency?
why?  they're only noodles.
okay, i told you what i wanted about minnesota fats. you just go ahead and play him, friend.
hang himself?!
i don't work for them, either.
you're money.
may i see that?
why do you always answer a question with a question?
yes. that's kind of how it was.
let me tell you something, doctor. chicks love a guy with a bad rap. they say they don't, but they don't mean it. they all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." the trick is to let them think it's true.
well we're not friends.
a hotel?
we can't.  we've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  if we go outside, we're risking more lives. you have to accept it, margo, there's nothing we can do.  the building must be swarming with police by now.  it won't take long for them to get through the doors.
you called, doctor?
yes.
he said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... i said good.  'cuz i got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
i lied.
that's so bullshit. this is so bullshit.
well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english.  you see, my dear jeanne... as it is written in the bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
excuse me, sir. i'd like to have a word with you.
the one he kept in his right hand. yes, you remember.
listen neil, i appreciate your interest in me but i'm not like you.  when you say things, people pay attention.  people follow you.  i'm not like that.
what's wrong with me?
how is his health?
it was nothing.
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you.  now if you're all cleared?  you can follow me then.
but she's moving away from the door.  who was sitting at this table?
my barbara was killed. i killed her. yes, it was my fault. everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. there was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. all was well until we got to the sleepy hollow bridge. barbara was singing a little song and then ...i don't know how it happened ..when i awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see barbara. barbara was dead.
nothing.
it'll just be a few minutes.
oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
my lady viola.
everybody still up on the island?
our troops have no part in this.  it has been started by the russians!
you mean i can't even get outa here?
i'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
what's for dessert?
it was a mistake, i never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now i love someone else.
gosh, i'm sorry, we better get in line.
no.
toxicology report came back. kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. it's for asthmatics. if an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. i checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited kendall.
audrey, listen, i need help. i know it's late and i shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me i wouldn't have if i could see any other alternative, but i – i'm sorry - listen, how are you – i'm sorry. you doing okay?
it's you, norman.  your fear of drowning.  you have to face it.
who paid the bill?
right.  so, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- i'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
would you do something for me?  i need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  i can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
but, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
it's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. and porous.
-- cooch. woh. stop.
i could see if i detect the presence of something.
my god.  then it was an animal.
i am for you.
only hurts when i breathe. lookit you. where are barney fife and aunt bea hanging out? and opie ... where's opie at?
you don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  or me.  or us.  remember...
yeah. tv busted?
figure we'll go have supper someplace. maybe get some barbecue out by stateline. sailor always liked that havana brown's pig pickin'.
piece of cake. she'll be there.
don't fall for that one.
that a fact?
what is it? a sapphire?
well, let's not get inna fight about it, ma.
i don't-don't know how they get through life. it's amazing to me.
i'm sorry.
absolutely.  when i come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  what do you think?
horny bastard.
oh.  what were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
six ayem.
i don't hafta trust her, i know her.
why would you want to leave?
sure, paul.  no hard feelings.
what's this?
the fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means i haven't done it right...  is that correct? i haven't done it right?
i can't, honey.  i promised allison i'd go shopping with her. sorry.
insurance?
was gonna be tomorrow morning. now, who knows?
she never will.  that is my job. it has been for a long time.  you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen.  i made her a star.  i cannot let her be destroyed.
what is terrance and phillip?
didn't have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan.  aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
let's start with some rhythm. sway back and forth like this.
i just don't understand about feeling sick the way i did. i never used to feel sick before. i used to feel like the very opposite. i mean, doing it or watching it, i used to feel real horrorshow. i just don't understand why, how what.
no more stalemate tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. they know me for what i am, tom-- and they're scared of me.
your daughter.
i was dead, too.
shh -- don't talk.  hold still.
logic indicates that is the case.
what'd i do?
oh, i wasn't pointing my finger at you. hey, you have to think of yourself. a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. there are too many bad people out there.
i was saying... it might even be possible that anna had left with them.
your mother will want to kiss me? give me back my letters.  that's the breaks i get. it's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  here.
what's that?
yo. i'll see you at that party.  i'll see you there?
why the fuck would i do that? i'd be screwing myself.
what'd you do?
yeah?  who is this?
get it in the stacks at the library of congress, now.  who's seeing the guy at c.b.s.?
i'm a forensic specialist, molly. you've seen my diploma?  i got a diploma and everything.
i did.  i'm not an alcoholic.  i just like to drink.
age?
yeah.  well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
you had it the entire time?!
noooo....
i think it's important not to get depressed. depression is a terrible thing. they say it can bring on illness.
any time, sailor.
you can all go home, now.  he's not going anywhere.
:he, josie and earl, running and playing in the field.
sacred herbs. tobacco. don't worry, we don't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe. that's a white man's myth. this is a sacrament.
not yee-aw, ya'll.  and it's gotta be angry.  like you're pissed off.
you have to ask like that?
no.
are you in special ed?
what do you think was wrong?
he's good, isn't he?
oh, that.
the mountains?
not what...who.  seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned.
nooo!!
what the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
huh-huh....you son of a bitch!
you were talking in your sleep.
yes, i'm doctor venkman.
sergeant... detective.  i wasn't aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet.
but can't you give me any idea?
dad, did you do it?  did you take that money?
that's good, honey.
about what?
archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. he's free.
listen--
okay.  where's nosferatu?
fight it back aubrey.  fight it back as hard as you can!
this ain't no social call.  one hundred bucks.  to find my father.
of course not!
you won't be lonely, charles...
i can hear you again, clearly.
objection!
no we can't. that's the problem. god knows it would beat hanging around with you!
you are?
not yet.
you've been married twice --
is this bad for him?
kenny'll want to go with you. cindy's holding a q and a session at the bleachers. come on.
i'll worry about that. let's get on with it.
that's funny, mr. whale.
i think  not.
we have snifters
all right, forget this filth. continue about your friend.
i'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! i'll do it!
convulsion?
but no one in particular.
it's big, anthony. real big. it's called hinckley cold storage.
he can learn to be phillippe in time.  but first he must learn to be louis, and for that he has two more days.
hello, sam.
just let me walk out, ok?
one day you will.
then my luck would have changed.
yeah, sure.
yes mother.
but i have no reputation.  i'm as free as the air.
forget about him.
what?
i'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
it's fine.
you didn't have to chase me so hard --
gum.
if i had pulled the trigger, sybok would be dead.
oh!  you got nerve, buddy.
i... heard something... came in here last night. must have gone to sleep.
matter of fact i do.
kindness? what's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
what does <u>that</u> mean?
<u>comwatch dispatch system</u>.  can't assimilate voice stress.  code priority only.
hurry, the woman needs help!
"and though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
jack wouldn't kill for it. besides, who would pay him?
and the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  maybe he never ordered the weapon, lou.  somebody else did. it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  lou, come alive.  these things are not adding up.
cause i have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. what do you say we cut to the chase. i'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
ouch. yeah?
never thought i'd hear ray gibson say that. hell with you then. you'd only slow me down anyway.
where's tommy?
sorry to hear it.
i'm not that kind of girl.
call her again.
i'm sorry, sir. we caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
i know.  h-how much do you need?
you've got to do something special.  you've got to make a statement.
i knew where it was.
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
walter can i ask you something?
your girl works in there ...
the most valuable commodity i know of is information. wouldn't you agree on that?
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. louisa was henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. four or five years go by, and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with louisa. i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. they're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. and the poor girl never came back.
what are the delusions like?
thanks...
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you. it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life.  including my mother. the character is also clearly in her early twenties, sally.
gold. you were going to—
why should we care?
he was a sorry sonofabitch, and i'm sorry i ever married him.
huh? get what?
before that.
nobody knew!
maybe i feel like a teenager.
hello, luv.
filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
aw, sure. this here's jus' a part of it. ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
of merlin?
he knows better.
oh, sorry.
sure.
no i don't.  you sure you haven’t seen her?
i'll be there.  the danburrys.  friday night.  thank you, chris.
that sounds so depressing.
open this door for no-one!
i mean, maybe you're right.  but were you really expecting me to say yes?
no.  did you?
could if we had to.  rather not.  rough weather.
good, good. give them that.
if i am your judge, i cannot be your champion. when i act as your king, i cannot be your husband.
you accusing me of extortion?
not much, admiral. we have partial main power...
not exactly.
already ain't. married a gal named --
hard to imagine you in boy scouts.
did salvy fuck vickie?
never mind darling. you go back to school. i don't want you missing anymore classes today.
am i starting to look norwegian to you, bwana?
yes. frank--
poor bastard.
when i find out who that phony bitch was.
some.  i am a rich bitch, remember?  i'm quoting.
it was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
'code blue'...
this is government business now. you ought to go home and get some rest, father.
huh?
hey, is that really necessary?
i also need someone who can read and write.
there, them stripy ones.
you told me you'd say that.
i'm getting out of there. right now, diz. right now. bonus or no bonus. i'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything i own--my extra hat-- everything--
i couldn't imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you.  so, i didn't.  he wanted you to have his last name...i let him even take that.
they are evil, cursed, they matter not.
why, of course.
i asked you a question, lothar!
wow.
this is crazy. i come home, you go to your room. you go in the kitchen, i go to my room. it's stupid.
you were waiting for a line-up then, too. what happened with that?
paley could be a problem tomorrow.
just klaatu.
really? you don't mind?
dr. ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. you must know him. he's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. he's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  it's not true. he was set up.
oh, really?
what about the guy he put in the body cast?
what's it say?
it's going back down.
maybe.
no, i will end my relationship with her -- totally.
tell me about yourself.
he probably sells insurance.  owns a chicken farm in hackensack.
we'll know -- in the next breath...
i am a hunter.  a weapon.  it's what i do.  it's in my blood.
good, make sure he don't jerk around.
no. i'd rather you didn't.
jim, you been with a girl yet?
you could put a pool in that backyard.
what are my orders, sir?
i have had them since childhood.  i cannot remember what from.
don't you start it, too!
in some situations.
leo, you're my agent.  tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  i didn't do anything wrong.  i fought in the war, for crissakes!
no, south georgia.
absolutely.
nicole...
it was a small house.
all i have in the world.
yes, what?
i heard the same sound at ladysmith, at nukden, port arthur.  what do you expect after a battle?
no, i'm having a heart attack. of course, i'm ok. what's that supposed to mean?
i understand perfectly.
zack, we've got to go.
oh... kinda the same way.
who else?
i heard it.
yes?
he'd want to know about all this.
he's just being nice.
no, why?
why do people think i'm tyler durden?
well, we'll have all the money in malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
yeah.
ah!
i am afraid so, son. about a week ago. her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
i needed a place to hide.  i'm in trouble, eddie.
- an understudy's performance.
it couldn't have been earlier?
okay, okay...
paul?
there were more than that.
no goodbye.  no fuck you.  no 'are you in love with george?'
eight. but i have a sorority meeting till nine, so i'll be back before you close. can we go out and get some coffee?
well, are you sure about this baby thing? it's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
that's for me to decide.
do we care?
i'm not sure.
oooo.
now where's she goin'? --
what would make you think that?
how much you weigh right now, fry? huh?
i'll bet the butler's name wasn't "jeff."
why do you say that?  is there something wrong?
shhh.
...tell graham --
don't tell him i told you--he'd break my neck.
it doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
you ask that of me? you're afraid to live in your coffin. you know what that means?
i thought he was a big tall fat fellow. didn't i meet him here one time? big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
no wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
that is so unoriginal. you disappoint me, randy.
he is sure you can do this. of course you can not.
maybe not. i did some checking, she's a hematologist. knowledge like that might come in handy.
oh no you don't! regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." can you guarantee that?
i like it.  this whole thing is pretty incredible.  i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york.
yeah.  drowning.
<i>turned out edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> int. fender compound -- kitchen -- [flashback] ten minutes ago
tens of thousands killed before sundown.  nobody's killed that fast since hiroshima and nagasaki.  did you bat an eye, max?  join amnesty international?  no.  i off one angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
yes.
<u>you</u> made coffee?... you're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... i love this!
then let me put your mind at ease .. firstly, amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and amber was a very independent young woman - she decided to leave - so she left ..
yes, yes, yes.  i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea. we'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
you were about to recognize me, sir--
it's garbage.
then don't.
i'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. it'll crush you.
what?
i had the cause of death.
green eggs and ham.  you're not going to get anywhere.  you might as well put me in the cage.
it was on c-span. yeah.
<u>you</u> put it in there.
no way.
i tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
why?
sure i'm sure. buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. you used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  this time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  the moment when contact becomes possible.  we've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
well, you gotta understand it. he doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
very well.
lis, i want to, i really do, but... oh, i can't.
of course, she's in on it too. don't let her see you. just go get that chest and show the world what collins has been doing. i'm staying here.
i thought it was spanish that you spoke?
there's a carriage house around back.
and a lot of time.
i think i should go back.
my god. he's going after the nest.
then don't complain.
well somone's got to suffer for this doctor. you've got to be merciful and quick. excuse me.
that i want you to take me home.
special to me, too.
well, excuse me, annette, but i'm braggin' up your kid, here.  amber's gonna be the next diane sawyer, y'know...
you judas ... blood-sucker ...
i'm looking for some perfume.
me?!
unless spoken to, ain't that right, horrace. didn't you say that?
there's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
beth, stop it!
where is the meeting going to be?
and now...
i'm frightfully sorry. there is a telephone in the public house about a mile down the road. i suggest you use that.
fine. but what would i do at night?
one cannot love and kill.
i don't-.
what are we playing for?
do you know who wanda june is?
i can sit through it once.
downstairs... at the front... jesus...
got a problem, meurice?
hello, george.
tom! they's a whole lot i don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  they was the time when we was on the lan'. they was a bound'ry to us then. ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. but now we ain't clear no more. they ain't nothin' keeps us clear. al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. an' uncle john is just a-draggin' along. pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. we're crackin' up, tom. they ain't no fambly now. rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. i been tryin' to keep her goin' but--winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? growin' up wild, an' ruthie, too-- like animals. got nothin' to trus'. don't go tom. stay an' help. help me.
... sally?
it's possible
where's rache?  it's <u>thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>rache</u>!
no it's not.
but she doesn't know, about her background.  she never heard of carlotta valdes.
okay, tee's the asshole, but mikey's the big winner.
yes?
we know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. i'm offering you the chance to call this off.
it's an investment.
how about the other one?  his friend.
stensland and meeks.  what were they up to?
if i hadn't killed beynon., you would have.
have you looked?
don't worry about paley.  he can't touch me.  no one can.  i've thought it all out.
yeah, yeah.  jesus.
no. i wasn't adopted.
always.
i'm sorry.  at least we're in on piece.
reliquary --
what'd he say?
oh, would you grow up.
no one's saying you did.
oh no, sir!
ohhhh i started this, didn't i, didn't i, didn't i, fuck.
no, i'm sorry. i'm really backward in certain areas.
we're not sure...
you got a maiden name, daddy?
ruth's already taken him home.
mmm. i made good time.  pilgrim's in the back. i found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
how good it felt!
what the fuck're you talking about? the carrier.  what's in the fucking carrier?
i don't let him.  he just loves to.
you want me to open a window or something?
you know, i get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
eve?  how enchanting...  wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell?
just the love in my heart.
well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
quite right, mr. chekov. what is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. before the captain and doctor mccoy freeze to death.
well i'm so glad that you guys are.
all right.  let's clear the mess and move out.
you know what... maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run.
were you there--how do you know?
why haven't you turned us in?
to kill your wife.
i have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
maybe i'll get off work.  i'd like to go.
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands.
-- ruined my exit!
four different people, inspector. three men and a women.  i've made slides for two.  they handled both envelopes.
what's that?
not at all.
not now, sven...
you as well.
if you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
huh?
it was a hate crime.
unless he was involved with grunemann's disappearance.
that's right. you got it! sure! he came in here and i made him change his mind. "bulletin editor saves john doe's life." why, it's perfect. i'll have ned write it up.  oh, ned!
because i had too much pride.  too much integrity.  i wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  some material i refused to do.
a telegram--a phone call might have helped.
it's just a party. daddy, but i knew you'd forbid me to go since "gloria steinem" over there isn't going --
but what becomes of our souls?
wonderful. when your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. i'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
i need ya help again.
my first undercover assignment. i gotta look good, right?
i don't mean fernando.
you cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>earth</u>!!
sleep. that's all i need. don't want to waste no time sleeping. you married?
did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
the guy from near where christie used to live?
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
i didn't see that much of it -- same as now. i only saw it as part of my own life.
say, chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the kiss concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
that's what i'm saying.
to you, to me it's thursday.
you bet. for five bucks, i'll even throw in the tongue.
what are you talking about?
hector, don't interrupt me.
these are not polite suggestions. they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
i'm not doing anything.  i just thought i'd go home and have some cold pizza -
it’s up to you whether they walk or not.
no, you're out, grandpa. it's my turn.
just take it slowly.
what should i say? you did fine work. we'll wait on the lab.
will you take of f your blouse?
your zee? hmm.  "from women's eyes this doctrine i derive: they sparkle still the right promethean fire; they are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
fuck pets. is this your partner? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again. fuck everything else. is this her?
it's midnight. one half of paris is making love to the other half. look at the clock. one hand has met the other hand. they kiss. isn't that wonderful?
then, take blood parasites.  it's yours.  now we each have three.
part.
good night!
i see. and what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
why, yes.
spock's burial robe.
oh, ya big lizard!  now we'll never know what it is!
i could do it. remember the day you wanted the pencil? i know why. and i saw that car again. i wrote the license number in my notebook. except i missed the last number.
'yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
you're the one, neo.  you see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but i've spent most of my life looking for you.
this will relax her.
you'll never get away with it, miss andrews. 
was this trip really necessary?
you said you wanted to know what happened -- i'm telling you the truth.
sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
one of these days, melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
boy, that is the real south. that is real corn liquor.
...a flaw...
i don't want to go that way.  find a way that we don't have to go through texas.
uh, can i have the other one. the one below this one. they show more in that one.
come on in.
guys. give me the two fifty and go away.
i came as fast as i could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. if i tickle my ass before...
no, not at all.  sure.  you're right. you fly home and get some rest.
how do you know this place?
a mistake...
okay, babe.  what's the matter?
i have a knack for designing clothes. but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
and that nasty man that followed us last night.  you didn't kill him.
and dick beat the shit out of them.
i'm here.
you don't work there anymore, bobby.
after what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
we're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. not because of some mig encounter.
open the door!
go ahead, shoot me.  then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
jefferies.
yeah, they were sluts. huh huh huh.
mmm. why don't you go away for a while?
missed me bad, huh?
no thank you.
what about mrs. moebius and...?
"bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
don't you like this?
a horseshoer?
my massacre at paris is complete.
then i guess i'm going by myself.
mac.  what's shaking?
no, it isn't.  your name is norman. but your younger brother -- what was his name?  the one who was stung when you were younger.  the one that died. the one you couldn't save.  what was his name?  "mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "but i don't want to go swimming, norman.  i'm scared." "c'mon, <u>harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  you heartless fuck.  that's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
what do you mean by that?
what?
it's alright.
what, you're seeing down to my nose? my chin?
if we don't, he'll die.
yeah. a real tragedy.
mister, i'm calling you out.
look, i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i'll leave you alone.
shut up boyd.
it's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes i bought you. you're skating on thin ice already, young man, so i wouldn't push my luck. now get out of those rags.
no.
the only word for this is trans- plendid. it's trans-plendid.
about ten kilometers.
no... she only comes to sit. two or three times a week. and i never ask questions, you know. as long as they're well behaved. i must say that i've wondered --
why?
what are we about to do?
she's still alive?
it usually is.
we could.  we could.  but we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  it's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. every summer, the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddy's farm. we would get up with the chickens. every summer the fence had to be repaired. the barn needed a coat of paint. we had to pip all of big mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday. for big daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
hello, my friend.  he doesn't look french to me, vincent.
captain, geordi...?
i want ta tell ya one last thing before i pull the trigger.
if you did it wrong, it would be painful. you'd choke to death.
why not? it's charming. i mean, i don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! it's not indecent!  it's highly moral, majesty. it's full of proper german virtues. i swear it. absolutely!
i like that, too.  look, j.j., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  we're going great, but please play it my way. i cased this kid. know his ins and outs...he's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  do little sidney a favor: squeeze! - you know, j.j. - the porcupine bit - needles.
indeed, sir, sometimes i'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
hey chief. bring my cup back.
if you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
the best part of ten years.
don't move.
brad, what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work?
sir, gregoire has been taking beers.
yeah, baby, how's it going?
yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
...and he called the reporters --
in the cellar, i think. wait, i'll take care of it.
i don't mind --
i'll take a bus.
not all... but it feels like a kiss.
-- tuscarora --
over there was fifth avenue -- and the plaza hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  we're on the carriage path.
we can't leave him out here, open the door.
you hear trouble.
i wanted to see you.
don't mind me, jimmy, i'm just a wild woman.
this rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
i live here.
how we doing?
austin, i have something for you as well.
i don't mind. if we give them something to talk about.
we'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
and that's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
well, i never heard that one.
a bunch of us girls are going for a swim. want to come along?
uh,  i don't know. i gotta tell you, i don't know.
we seek the ogre, baron couer de noir.  he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
aye, we'll get 'em.
oh, yes, i am, because <u>afterwards</u>--up here in the moonlight.
yeah.
in fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
--separate, in the evening..."
twelve thousand.
no, i guess it's okay.
i've got a gun.
larry, did you rent a car?
she wants to kill you.
of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  just a little startled.  one of those sushi dropped down my kamali.
i'll be back.
what about you?
i have spoken with your father.
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination. i feel sorry for --
usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
i've never seen any of these men before.
why, what's up?
put it on.
heavy third world connections. they get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
[we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. the same man 'the dreamer'. listen to this.]
i don't want him hurt...
lighten up...
you fell too much. so much you make me feel...
it's not exploitation.  these people wanna sell and i wanna buy. how are golf clubs exploitation?  she takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
because i say so.
i want nothing to do with the arena.
we will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
i asked odette to take a look at little anais. she has a rash.
that's right, steve.
i was grateful.
what?
i'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
i don't know why she'd pick him over you.
well, i did.  and you know what i think? i think that it was almost... too perfect.
i'm not going to tell you that. i wanted that e- ticket. i wanted it so bad i'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and i'd do the same again.
the gun will be there.
color?
that's no surprise.
i know who she is.  take a message.
plus he fell in love with a temp.
first nagasaki--now this.
you and the colonel go back.
not yet.
we're looking for him. in your opinion, why did frank kidnap dorothy's son and husband?
how much? okay. make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. bye.
uh-huh.
they told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... in other words, things of that sort.
i don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, mr. dalton, but, whatever it was, i hope you've learned your lesson.
john, where are we g --
what's new onna street?
didn't you just see her lookin' at him? she told me no, but i don't believe her.
so. i guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? simple.
watch yourself!!
yes.
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
yeah.  i remember our first date.
i think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
that's not what you were about to say.
it's about the sharks. since you were frozen, they've been placed on the endangered species list. we tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
i sent andy out on murder missions. for god's sake -- it's the boston strangler, alber desalvo.  he used their own stockings to strangle them.  tied in a bow-knot.
that's intelligent.
news? yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
no. they never figured it out. i did. most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. not without hurting them.
furthest point i could find from new york.
yeah, like al capone on tax day. get the keys?
how would you propose we handle it, doctor?
that, sir, does not compute.
he's still working out some identity issues.
i know, your wickedness.
boy! my head's like a balloon--for two whole days. i never knew there was so much american history.
a girl named amanda.
well, i'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
dig.
say no more.
very well put.
i asked you to marry me. i'm ready for marriage. that's responsibility. that's growth.
close. we're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; i recommend the rum baba ...
you know, there's, like, this rule. we get to go home at 7:55.
i wouldn't know where to start.  i guess it was about one man framing another. he thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
yes i know.
this...is not going to work out.
so you didn't have the key with you.
whose side are you on?
...and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma, louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans...
lula? i love you, baby. i just want you to be all right.
that's a "rookies" doll. george sanford brown. we gotta lotta dolls. they're real cool. did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "the black hole"? i always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of earnest borgnine.
what are the rules for a sweater vest?
i'm in the vending room.
yeah.
jackie, what're you doing?
naw...
i'll be your guest!
...i was one of a group of...
eugene de beauharnais.
that's just what she said. i had a boner with a capital "o." i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. i found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines. she was a wild chick. she was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. you know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
is it ready to go?
the funny thing is, i'm not randall either. i'm logue.
so?
and you're certain you can find the way back? even in the dark?
no.
why?
is there anything i can help you with?
i just got something off the wire. the woman who owns it was murdered last night.  now, i'm not saying i agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
well, son, i want you to know i hope everything works out with you and alabama. i like her. i think you make a cute couple.
i don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
why?
about one to five years worth.
he ain't ever okay to me.
and they took that away.
good. my heart can't take it.
will you stay here till i fall asleep?
very dangerous.
what's happening here?  you're dead!
this is a complicated case, your honor...
i think you should go back to your seat now, joey. right, clarence?
i'm telling you!
me and you'll drive down to long beach tomorrow. i'll introduce you to matthews, tell him what's going on.
i like the tent better.
listen, i think i'm hit bad.
your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
and what about you?
you're joking.
yeah.
some of it, yes.
with you.
no.
why?
how nice you look.  is that your uniform?
keep your eyes open.
she was dirty and wet...
i knew you'd understand. that's why i came to you for help.
i'll be there for you.  he won't try anything while i'm there.  i promise.  i'll protect you.
i have little time for your mercenary concerns, but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  what is your price?
don't they? he's down at the tombs right now.
we couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
there is no letter.
you little shit.  when did they get to you?
try me.
who said that?
what is?
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you wouldn't suffocate.
and don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
sorry, mr. sheldrake -- i'm full up. you'll have to take the next elevator.
why didn't you beep my communicator?
we're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
but... only when no one is looking.
see something you like, my man?
busy
[who gave the bags to ramos?]
it is serious, mrs. ramos.
you know, i came back to mount vernon to retire.  i don't need to be in government.
so am i.  thy father will have to know of thy lying.
i was in it.
stay forever.
yeah,  come off it, eric. who is it?
now isn't that just too cute? there's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? you've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
[listen! i will give you a life for a life.]
a huge law firm. okay? they put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'you must drop by with pat and me...' okay...?
no.
what i don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
you don't believe in anything do you, bobby?
being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico?
justice already knows.  talk to me, john.  tell me what's happening?
i'm used to it.  not everyone likes music.
understanding of what?
yeah, sure. of course.
i opened the present you got me from harrison's.
if you hadn't used profanity --
if you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
didn't you find out anything about the porters?
calvin, i insist i be allowed to capture it!
and he gave it to us.    145 ridgeway road.
sure.  did you see the others?
stanford. i'm leaving in june after i graduate.
oh, shut up! it's the woman who's in control of these situations. men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
i'm sorry i didn't believe you.
i'm pleased.  i really am.  really....
sure.
look, toto! before i kick your ass all the way to china and back, let's make a deal. these strips here are yours, i give them to you. however! one  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. two  i'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for god forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! ok? oh!!! and now scram!
order fromberge to keep him in safety!  it is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
really?...
see ye got two more peeps to your brood.
george... how about felicia?
thank you.
not far from here, south boston.
you're beautiful. let's have sex.
i'll make this as simple as i can, george. they disappeared.
you shouldn't have hit me.
why did you do that?
but honey ...
by your leave, sir.
she's alright, nels, thanks for asking.
a simple 'please' would suffice...
no, we don't. their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take mr. merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. they don't want him.
i think he might be worried.
and it's a all real.
i don't know what to...
our clothes are dry.
you?  you think i don't get that? god, it's like just because i don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
tourists, about twenty of 'em.
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? i had a milk shake.
eddie, how could you do it? your brother's girlfriend.
what are you saying?
did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds?
see ya tomorrow.
it was under control, bud.  butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
not even when it meant something.  is that one night up in flatbed?
armed.
coop, agent chet desmond has disappeared. gone like the wind in deer meadow.
we took care of that.
hello!  good morning.
i can't take that job! i mean, i mean, i can't take it right away. i'm still recuperating, i just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
i try to be.
paisley porter.
yeah, well i like to think i'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters.
for this.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
i didn't mean no offense.  i guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  ned an' the kid, my partners, are they... ?
why should he forget it?
mm-hm.
what? what are you saying?
the b-9 is like a slow child, sir. and data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. i'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. he'll be disappointed when the bi-9 cannot meet those expectations.
who else did you see?
it's all right, you're all right. i'm with you.
well, if the a.t.f. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
what does he want with a precog?
looks like she was a neuroin addict like john doe here, but i show an address history that includes the beaton clinic.
let me breathe, let me breathe...
who would you call, mr. cole, who would straighten everything out?
control yourself or you'll spurt. he's bound to be somewhere.
what is it?
it was nothing...i was assuring mr. lingk...
like?
you guys are being real assholes
yeah, sure. we were losing the war.
of course. every day.
no, rick. no, you see, victor laszlo is my husband... and was, even when i knew you in paris.
look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  we cover the bank, whatever.  you and me.  that way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... i don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
she's just outside the door.
you know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. keeping it real. know what i mean?
no idea, just talked to her on the 'net--she's very good.
you'd say if you mind?
romance in ridgemont? we don't even get cable tv.
breaking out
i have a little prepared speech i give when my suitor wants more than i'd like to give him.... gee blank, i had a nice....
<u>what</u>?
get that little fucker!  great tackle! reminds me of my days at whittier. most of these kids are useless.
a coward too. that's why she had to go.
she's your girlfriend.  open it, talk about your kids.
let them fight.
don't know yet... i have to get in touch with alan. he was going to tell me how to
you wanted to see me, charlie?
will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
they did show up.  isn't that great?
i get passes to the best shows in town. mrs. k though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
nah... how much money have you got?
i know. i suppose, mr. paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
boston, huh? did you get your degree up there?
what do you mean?
oh, good, my way. thank you, vizzini.  which way is my way?
you mean the snake.
one possible future.  four your point of view.  i don't know the tech stuff.
this way?
live there?
i am not sure... it could be twice the distance.
then why are they holding us here? why don't they destroy us right away?  economically, it's not sound at all.  very much unlike....
no, that's all right, i don't mind. i came up here for two reasons. to begin with, i was bored with my job in san francisco. i was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
we don't want to push her away. these are growing experiences.
when you get a chance.
well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
no caviar for me, thanks.  never did like it much.
that's not what you said last night. and, i didn't bring that "prick" josh.
n-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
you still seeing that shrink?
i don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
like following me around and pestering the people i work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
you know, you saved my life.  and i just wanted to say... i forgive you for talking during the movie. almost.
they've made contact with the reapers.
oh, jesus h. christ!
and why would that scare me?
yes.
man, i must really be stoned.  thanks, buddy.
do you mind if i... ask you why you got divorced?
send that?
not before i settle with you.
get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! don't fuckin' ignore me! you motherfucker!
you gotta help.
oh, is that what this is about? you want to hear that i don't really have any brothers? that i'm a fuckin' orphan? is that what you want to hear?
like i had to say it? no, i wanted to say it.
no, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
he killed her...he killed her...
that's exactly why we want to do this play.  to show the world the true hitler, the hitler you knew, the hitler you loved, the hitler with a song in his heart. 
you're famous. somebody called me. what are you doing in a place like this?
i know.
no...  it's all right. i got it. don't worry about it.
want me to come back some other time?
ilsa... you're alright?
and i also believe in god and the devil. in fact, i know they exist.
look, miss.  we're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
quietly, slow down, whoa --
fine.  i'll say no.
like a jewel. turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
and some pecan pie.
-- richard.
that's fine.
we're gonna get mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. ya know, that's the deal. now if lorraine calls, or sylvia, you just say that mom is in florida with pearl and marty...
you haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
no, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
what am i scared of?
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
i promise.
not staying in here another....
all right... where did you see her?
they're from my old convent.
why don't you just move out to portchester?
'68.
i'm not just saying it!
thanks.  for everything.
yes –– charge.
because i've got the greatest job in the solar system.  as long as the turbinium keeps flowing, i can do anything i want.  anything.  if fact, the only thing i ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
trust me, this ain't one of those times.
somebody'll see.
maybe.
nobody brought us here. our plane crashed. we were shot down by --
very well! throw that basket in the river and drown him!
i was dreadful, miss channing, believe me - i have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
well, then, i--i *thank* you, miss saunders! nothing better could have happened--. yes *sir*, miss saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
yes!  god, yes.  i ... i just want to hug you.  to hold you.  to tell you it's alright.
could i speak to you in private?
he's so cute. i even like his cute little penis. it's like a little pig's penis or something.  rose, we connect on every level. i've finally found someone i can feel completely safe with.
...hi.
you be careful to. i'm going to miss you.
let me tell you how father, and please confidential. burke dennings, good father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'm' street, with his head turned completely around. facing backwards.
too proud to admit you're crazy about me, dr. jones?
yeah.
michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
you mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. i'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
i just don't see it.
blind? how stupid can you get, animal? i drank the stuff myself.
maybe. maybe just.
i'm not sailing with this thing on board!
i'm not 'going out' with catherine.
we found one.
we are not a saloon act.  we do not take tips from dirty old men.
what are you?
ummm... no, no. different 'ravell.'
it's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. see, i know a little about missing persons.  when kids run, they almost always leave a note.  it's guilt. they want to say goodbye.
down here, hooper!
what is wrong...?
if she held on any longer she could have.
yoda spoke of another.
dead, i'm afraid.
let me help you along, martin. you're a sociopath!
not at all, huh?!... let's go to the hotel. and if you're lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
give who a tail?
i gotta tell ya, wade, i'm leanin' to jerry's viewpoint here.
fine, thank you. the bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
i found it.
you like being a hooker, vivian?
oh, that's will. he's a friend. you'd like him.
of course... i haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
oh, so you're a warrior then?
jack.
yeah, that was easy.
no, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. that's cold.
nobody asked you to.
would you describe their position as inflexible?
whoops... don't mind me.  go ahead and finish up.
well...yeah. okay.
ready for anything.
best get down close to the moat, lad.
yeah?
i guess that's where everyone meets him.
yes.
yes, captain.
i didn't tell anything, i told the truth.
at least your father tried, george.
we can't rely on your judgement anymore.
what do they know?  i had nine, but i feel through the ice when i was seven, my brother pulled me out.  then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily, it was a dud.  i figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
love that name.
it ain't. it's part of the lessons of life. i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape?
my orders came through. my squadron ships out tomorrow. i'll be leading a very important mission.
you've got a dark side, selina kyle.
not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why i blew her off... i need your help, max.
i wasn't feeling my best that day. i'd just drawn thirty to life.
no-one.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
made some money, came back here--
that's lucky.
i'm not crazy.  i'm inept.
and what? and let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? and let you disgrace me?  get up. get up and be a mother. get in the car and go to the house...
watch clark.
counselor, you're bluffing. shall i push for misdemeanor two?
on what?
why, you must drink! all poets drink!
ronnie. please, baby...
i know.
well if you're sure, i won't be a bother. oh, i don't sleep on no spring mattress. i always make myself a pallet on the floor.
i didn't say anything.
i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
now?
and is that what you're going to do?    is that what you're going to do...?
elaborate on 'they,' okay?
i didn't want him meeting me here.
yes, i slept with him but that was a long time ago.
until he comes. he's a nice guy. you've met him.
do i know hans hinkel?
sleep good.
what?
you're insane! you didn't kill the romonovs - it was the...
why—uh—
mr. fettes and i have professional matters to discuss.
father, come in, please.
you beat 'em to shit, pal!  jesus!
you're not wimping out on us, goodspeed.
victor, are you feeling alright?
one date, jen--that's all i'm asking. if you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
now, jabez! i've got on my sunday bonnet and i'm going to church with my husband. almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, i don't know what is.
how do you that.
and so i am.
if you won't take me to dinner with your parents, i won't meet you at the motel.
i'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  all we can do now is batten down and ride it out. if things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
sixty days.  here.  don't mention it.
i've got something in my bag.
of course not... but... when i was a child... i remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
no.
hunh.
relax.  i've flown with my old man a million times.  and he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
mr. scruggs, jeff wigand. lowell bergman said i should give you a call...
andy, you're not horrible.  you're just... complicated.
you think so, eh? which comes first, l or... glooph?
larry, we can re-open the beaches in august.
you talked to new york?
it's that time of year again. we should get a pretty good show out here.
only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
you wouldn't!
you know how to drive a stick?
get on to yourself!
well what would you call him.
people are more relaxed.  less stress, less traffic, better tips.
no.
you know, he was formerly a sailor.
not as bad as yours, pal.
you know nothing of power, you foolish girl. you think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an emerald seer. power is none of these.
that you would have known you can trust me.
two million.
that inquiry invades my personal life, captain.
that's not a bad idea. how many episodes before he comes back?
good. very good. tibet is a great country. a wonderful history. long ago, you even conquered part of china. but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. in twenty years time you could be ahead of us. then it will be your turn to help china.
hi.  it's me.  i got a favor to ask you.
what is that?
is your ship equipped with omega satellite navigation or loran?
we need some towels, lou.  we need replacement light bulbs.
how do you know?
she's dead.
hold still - hold still --
how long was i gone?
who's your little friend?
well, i don't record negro songs. i'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'pappy o'daniel flour hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
the question isn't who i am.  the question is, who's with me.
what is it?
that was money. tell me that wasn't money.
nonsense, my dear.  you look extraordinary.  today's script.  quick.  and a pencil.
now rex.
and you're happy about that?
young man, i am no stranger to theatres. i'm no stranger to insolence!
five years past me clan fought another over some- thing i cannot even re- member.
ya get the special?
well, this guy i've met runs a hotel. brother. loads of contacts. does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners. get you a good price.
just until we find another girl.
thank you -- i've worked hard to become so.
yes.
...mathilda, i don't feel like talking about this.
i love you.
there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know.
must be some mess back there.
they couldn't prove it.  no body!  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
what, doctor?
that's not the way to win him back... not leon.
'cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
uhura, i thought you were on leave.
thanks ... i love you.
why thank you sir.
we're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... the goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. should have it fumigated too.  i saw a fly today.
god!  but there's nothing to say about god.
it's that disrespect for you, that's what i can't forgive them.
you really are a beautiful woman.
it's a thought.
yeah, pretty well.
maynard banks, esquire. attorney at law.
i'll never get my washing done.
yes sir.
oh... a little of both. just thought i'd look around at nashville for a while.
we know what's down there. we did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. a direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
been away. up to houston.
or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. you have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. he isn't in it to hurt people. he's in it to make money.
c'mon, goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
okay, because if i can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then i gotta call back that money -
i'm not so sure.  look again in three months.
what novel did you read.
te...!
worries about his mother, eh? give him a hug for me.
ouch! eat? you can do a solo if you don't step on it. i'm going to bow out on you.
easy, huh? hell, i don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... i could see shootin' 'em...
what if i were to say "your wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
creasy, how old are you?
you can't do anything real until you are dalai lama.
but being out of the game gives me time to write.
barely.
about suzie?
mr. bradley left about a half hour ago.  he said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
c.p. time is colored people's time. the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late.  that negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
it's been a tough day.
wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
and look what you've done to mr. bigglesworth!
you built our patio while you  were on the county?
i said buttplug. she's heinous.
it could be...
the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills.  the phone company shows no unusual --
in that event, we won't need so many supplies.
why not?
not really, no.
you're stalling, verbal.
i'll take some lessons this time. i promise.
it starts at eight...
she was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... straight from leaving you.
thank you very much. but, cliff, that's my seat. and i was just--
don't you understand, george? it's because you were not born.
yeah, sure.
how much tea do you drink, prime minister?
in the envelope in my pocket.  my right.. jacket..pocket..
well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
what do you want to tip me for? look, you got to spell it out. whatever you want, just say it.
you made every day like kindergarten.
i know.
beats me.  ask your mom.
i am not responsible for your assumptions.
thank you, bob. the electricity is everywhere tonight. rocky balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier.' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... his record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
yeah. come on—come on!
now i'll have to wait at least a week. if i announced it tomorrow, after what our new chief nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from seoul to washington.
yeah, but i'm buying.
the mental hospital.
no. that was the point.
with all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
oh my god ... ann?
sometimes, sure.
and do you remember where she got off?
and yet he attacked us. and told the ba'ku we were a threat...
it's not safe for you to be either.
marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
don't sweat it. now i got an l.a. gun story. you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home. he had an uzi. mike half-smiles.
we're -- conducting a new experiment.
i really think we should go back...
show you?
shut up and keep packing.
no, sailor darlin'. just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... i been carryin' a secret too...
i didn't say that.
this is a college?  i'm sorry, i thought it was a carnival.
twenty.
what did you call her? what did i hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
what?
get lost bobby.
i think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
the guy we're doing? he's disappeared from the map. i can't find him anywhere.
you <u>did</u>, you--
you always overreact, clark. how terrible can it be?
are you sure this is bailey park?
we're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
neither are we.
and you thought they might be under her dress?
warsaw's not the only radio station.
h'm?
cause i had a bad dream about him. i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr. crandall buried him in the pet sematary.
what?
yeah, bring us four fernet.
okee-dokee. it's like this, krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. so they bring his ass in and me an' nicholson go to work on him.
how long... how long i been out?
doing what?
maybe we should do something?
you get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
sporting events, yeah.
that's exactly what this place is. one great big coffin.  let's stake 'em.
another accident?  you got to be more careful.
twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  why?
30.55. twenty more will get you back.
you ain't got nothin' i ain't seen.
would a jury around here convict their own? i think not. we're beginning an interesting game here, mr. rains.
no, i... i just wondering where you've been all this time.
i was talking about us. working together.
no, i won't wait -- i can't -- every day is precious -- every hour -- every minute.
i'm so sorry.
big talk.
do you really, you really, like shostakovich?
-- there's plenty: for all we know, steven's got her spying on us right now --
what do you mean?
it's because of me.
in many capacities.
well, i know, more so. that's why i was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
what makes you think so?
i need to... um... talk to you.
four. you're great with these kids.
what?
yes what?
how the fuck should i know!!
nobody said shit, eduardo --
he was with me?
what are you going to do now, tom?
i thought you'd chickened out on me.
okay, sammy.
doctor soran?
you mean tommy.  yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  messed up his head.  he's harmless, though.  probably just lonely.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
aversion?  no... "hatred"... "loathing"...
that's what i'm talking about.  a real hong kong night club.  you want an altoid?
well that's for me to know - but i did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
you and your friend.
nobody else had it.
you think i'd let you drive my cadillac car?  i ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my cadillac car.
nothing, sir.
mojitas...?
don't go away.
i'll talk to them, i'll talk to them.
i killed him once, i'll just have to kill him again.
lobotomy?
i don't know.
remember high school?
call it a hunch.
all bands.
what do i do? i'm the vp of finance.
sir! sir, i'm sorry! he didn't mean it! he was trying to get me.
why?
i will, i promise.
not... totally.
like what?
what kind of a boy are you? boys always have candy.
did you like it mister brock?
it's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
but she's not dead, wes.
i see.  and where did you drive?
man. i'm sorry. we just went for a walk --
but i...
does clifford even know?  you didn't tell him, did you?  i'm gonna tell him. where is he?
i used my body on the guards.  it gave me control. i got to a gun and i took my chance.  i’ve never told anyone that.
good luck over there mccawley.  i admire your decision.
he's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay! they're going to be shooting at him!
he was the bank on that shipment outta mexico three years ago.
lloyd, when we were in principal collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
oh, no. she brought me my meals.
you afraid you'll have to salute me, chief?
never heard of a double-cross?
what for?
of course i am. it pays to humor the insane.
it was his idea.
i think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
i'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
we've got a good arrangement, that's all. whistler makes the weapons, i use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
how 'bout some christmas music?
i tried to contact you by phone but i couldn't...
makes two of us.
surrender!!
mickey, you're off the hook.  you should be celebrating.
that girl you boned last year. remember?
-- what you don't understand --
tons and tons.
i'm sorry?
we should be fine, then.
you're kidding.
i said no.
i don't want your fucking money!
yeah, they are but...
it's the maintenance entrance. runs along the side of the tunnel. when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it.
just tell me.  tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared. what kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  what the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
i hope i never get that old.
tell eve? you mean mrs. rand?
i've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  i forgot to phone mel kaufman.
merlin, i didn't know --
i think we should put her on the payroll. see what she comes up with.
fine. you're the first reporter in here for two hours. you people seeing the old year out?
seems like she could get a date easy enough...
everybody just shut up!
yes.
tell me, how do you do that?
she allegedly humped him to death?
no... i have a... room... at the hotel de perrin.
when exactly?  a day, a week -- when?
mike found a red pickup abandoned on flanders.  you see it?
what's wrong?
please josh?
what octopus motor?
oh.
you could say that.
on liz, as she walks through the h.q., on a board we see "days till election 6" and % in favor 82%.  a huge tv shows the president.
you saw a lot in one night.
how much?
shit dude, i'm sorry--
please, call me mordechai.
what is it?
so it was "love".
nine.
frank dropped me in the west valley and i hiked.  you look frozen.  what's happening?!
yeah, intensive care ward.  my god-hey, max, i think she's... i think she's giving me the eye.
i bet.
i...
baptized? well, get baptized then. i don't give a shit. call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! i can't baptize you.
yeah. sure.
yeah, well, i don't have time to screw around. i got buyers in dallas, houston and vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
what was what?
i thought he was, but he came back.
my father always said to me, 'son, don't invest your money in anything but land. land! stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'remember that ,' my father said. 'land."
it opens, too. look inside.
that's why i wear a target on my chest.
i shall wear it in my hair!
so tell me how it is.
it's... i don't know.
that's all?
as long as people think jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
it's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
uh, yes..
virgil!  now look at what you done!  are you all right?
you guys got the latin homework?
yes, but... really, i hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. people won't take you seriously.
does it make the cars any better?
i've got to be going.  i've got a meeting tonight.
oh, i think you can do it. probably.
i don't know.  i could quit now if i wanted, i just don't want to.
i'm not quite dead, sir ...
will you watch it and see for yourself?
two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
i think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
just browsing.  don't touch me....
you can change it if you want to.
that is a contradiction. the borg act as a collective consciousness. there are no individuals.
drugs??!
what?
try the emergency channels...
faith, betty.  but make sure it's your own.
is that paul goodman? no. and be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. hi, doug! douglas wyatt. "a foul-rag-and-bone shop-of- the-heart."
only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work.
you sure you want me too?
pop?
at the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
"just!?"
starting to recognize a pattern?
no!  whatever talent simone has comes from me -- me!  me!  i swear, as god is my judge.  you don't know what i've been through.  tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  why do you think i've been wearing these?  i may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  to extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  don't you see?  i made simone!
yeah, who's this?
nygma. edward nygma. you hired me. personally. just like i tell everyone.  well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
um-hum ...
running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
yeah, so what happened?
you're kidding.  no sex?  nothing?  no mu-shu?
a glass of champagne, please.
me too. that's why i fight so hard.
why are you following me?
where's clifford?
look around, this place is a dump!  naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
well, in my prayers, i realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  god would never allow anything like that to happen.
we have a murder?
yes.  i'm sure.
this is the perfect time. you know what makes a good detective? the number of confessions they get. you're a good detective, osborne. so now you get mine.
how about a nice glass of milk?
can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
exactly how do you mean?
where you going?
i don't know.  i couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
what happened to them?
pendergast may be in trouble.  don't you understand?  he still hasn't come back.  it's been over three hours --
i try not to.
when you call me gabriel, i know i've got trouble.
and what is that bonasera?
where was it parked?
name's patrick, i met him at the driving range.
let me call you a car, linda.
come on, a wuss like me?  the stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
no.
you're a wonderful man. two o'clock is a good time. here's the key in case he's asleep. open the curtains for him, so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
jesus christ, how can you be so stupid?
how goes it, darlin'?
daddy!
let me tell you a story. there's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. the young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
you'll be fine.
come on, gimme a break.
it doesn't matter.
oh, yeah, well, you know.  i'm a big fan.  i've read all your work.
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out.
now, orson, you know i'm just dyin' to see your picture and i know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
that's bullshit. just shoot.
don't tell me you've actually read it, jeremy.
you don't want to.
it'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. nice work, daddy.
oh, so you decide to be a cop? seriously? you don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
so that's it? you don't ever want to see me again?
i begged him to let me put that on!
i'll do whatever you want. you don't want me to ever see kayleigh again, fine. just let crockett go. besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. and i know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
did you go to her?
it couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  i'll just read it to you the way i got it:  "... hostile... survival... advise do not land... "  and that's all it could translate.
hey, wait a minute. you got change comin'.
uh, i hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, i would say, at the turn of the century.  who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
red ...
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin"?
they are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  welcome! help yourselves to drinks! glad you could come! have a good time.
yes.
i don't know. he was right behind me a minute ago.
he's not that bad of a guy ..?
maybe just a little around the edges.
according to this tag.
i don't want anything. i just wanted to say... that i may have... overreacted a little the other day.
for two hundred?
really?  some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do?  no, thank you.  i just got off the phone with one.
fuck you. go then. i'm taking the car.
just now. they want you to come down to his school.
what is that old building?
huh? yah?
you're *trespassin'*! it ain't you lan' no more! an' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
you seem a decent fellow. i hate to die.
some men get the world.  others get ex-hookers and a trip to arizona.
maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
what is it?
it's tatopoulos.
your chauffeur's been waiting, baron.
god, i wish i could say no. this is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
i...
yeah.
admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
i'm definitely traveling some day.
wait a minute! when did this happen, that we're partners?
so we get a little more for the boat. besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
totally! look!
right. april 25th.
no, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. it's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
oh, that goes way back. they had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. bad timing for me though. middle of the war. the draft.  i'll tell you prof, after viet nam ... i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
greetings.  i am the count.
we are to meet mr. rutagunda.
i've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  but i'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
oh... alright, back you go.
there's no such thing as an accident, nicole.  not in a situation like this.
wow, you were "in the joint." "doing hard time."  it's funny, but that excites me.  i seem to have a thing for sinners.
don't worry.  i do it every halloween.
what's the matter, boy trouble?
do you think she's safe?
oh i like her a lot.
pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
his word.
you guys, you guys, you're all the same. the doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'what i'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'we did the best that we could. i'm dreadfully sorry...' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
sue, i've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. and this is the biggest step yet. if it helps, think of this as a promotion. a merger of sorts...  four little words that can change our lives...
claire.
let's see it.
cynthia, i don't think you want to, i mean, you should see the way he dresses. i really think he's in a bad way.
well... as you know, maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
they'll be looking at you. they don't know who you are.
if he was so good why's he so dead?
i need a sample of your blood. what do your borg friends say? resistance is futile. 
i'm sending you back to hell!
no, it will turn out well.
ha ha.  that's too much, georgie.  those days are over.  the rate is one-thousand dollars.  inflation, you know?
what?
right before his un-american thing.
what kinds of questions?
i can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
objection.
no shit?
is this where no one stays?
maybe.
why should i help that old fuck.
oh dear god...
i don't believe it! i don't believe a word of it!
living with him put years on me.
why not just go to... nome for supplies and a wife?  isn't that closer?
what?
someone reliable, i'm sure.  a booze- hound in a bar?
then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
if corbett's men find out --
like what?
i came on at 8:00.
i sometimes feel things've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed, senator.
yeah.
the meanest!
i just got here myself.  went to the public library.  cut four classes!
we'll convince them.
how can i calm down when i'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  i've had enough!
look at the way i live.
i'm not experimenting.  why don't you go experiment.
i will. and i choose --
yeah.  right, uh-huh.  i feel like i've discovered this whole new side of me.  music is so expressive.
ash?
well - nobody's perfect.
i don't want anyone to die.
no... i meant...
i don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
paul, can you hand me the olives? ruth, i need you to, what was it?
what do you want?
you might loosen the straps then.
they must've scuttled it. nobody just lets a ship float away.
you saw this?
what we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
my name is walk-er. and i intend to report it the way it is.
no thanks, birdie.
...it's very american.
can't we just --
datura metel. the devil's trumpet. don't worry. i ain't goin' religioso again. it's a flower that grows on these islands. where i come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a mickey finn. it's toxic. ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
tex? you mean he's here, too?
no. i think i'll stay right here in hell.
all that banging and pounding.  i don't know.  we should think about making a good first impression.
catch me letting you go alone!
do you always transport through the air?
that road can be a bad one at night, melanie. 
ship's log.
get lost!
why?
i don't have any family any more.
so was i. so don't give me any shit. your business is just as bad. at least i'm up front about it. you kill people slowly. your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. now you know how it feels.
there's no disease, i can tell you.
you lost someone.
because i think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
don't make fun of me when i'm being wonderful and supportive.  you belong on the court.  just like i belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
yes.
i was worried about the rig.  i've got over four years invested in this project.
i'm telling you right now, i'm fine. i lost my goddamn balance and i couldn't see a moment, but i'm ok.
well, for the baby, really.
what job?
don't i know you?
the pearls are in her room.
what do you mean?
gosh! what do you know about that!
it's raymond.
i'm going to play my records all day
i can't, how can i, in all decency? we've had a good run, haven't we?
that is so sexist. the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct.
sure.
i thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
in about fifteen minutes.
to who?
i haven't either, but i've heard about them. you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople; without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
and he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.
i'd love to, at any time.
i saw...
you're not going to use that gun, johnny.
nothin'.  just stiffed those kids. don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
i was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...would you like to go to dinner? i know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
... but it was all we had.
it certainly is.  i agree with you completely.
pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
no...i just have a little stop to make.
i saw this show once. it was about logging. i was home sick, there was nothing else on. do you know how they break up really bad log jams? you know, when they're really tangled... ?
i know what that's like.
if i'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
he's... you can't reach him, sir. he's in the, on some island in the caribbean, they don't have a phone.  he'll be back in a week...  if you'd like dr. halpern's number...
because you're leaning?  no, you're just on an angle.  you're too heavy!
i didn't know we had any women left.
bartok... a question.
. . . what??
a hotel?
you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente, gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out?
enthusiastic?
hey.
what'd he give to you?
yeah, well, i've been around the bend a bit.
i'm gonna borrow a car. from eldon.
-- a steal at eleven hundred dollars.
he's in the insurance business.
dance, jack!  the night's but begun.
go to lax and get on a flight to new orleans.  go to the ponchartrain hotel and wait for me.  i'll call you there.
hey charlie.
your pocket?
for evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore his forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
you'll get used to it.  i'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
speaking of which...
i called you last night.
we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
very much.
c'mon, sal.
i mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
i'll see you shortly. a meteorite just hit the ground near here and i want to check it out .. won't be long.
monsieur varlac, i will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, i will carry out your execution, on the spot.
what?
sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  as for a photo -- if you can't do it, i know twelve million people who can.
here. make it easy on you.
like what?
well -- you sent for me.
don't you?
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
well, let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. do you go along with this belief?
i... i thought it was great. i loved it. it was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
that's okay, as long as he believes it was johnnie.
yes, well, what i'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. she can't wait too long, you know. now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. i mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
why don't you try counting sheep?
they didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  they'll get him next time.
siesta.
you wanna take the chance, casper?
you ought to see my backhand.  and wait till i serve the meatballs. 
it's three in the morning.    not much else to do.
never reach out!
oh, he's moved out?
archibald dobbs; certified public accountant.  but, that's all we got.
get a boob job.
let me go! i wanna see him!
so what's the problem? girls do that all the time.
turn it off, lex!  turn it off!
i don't think so.
well, i haven't come around.
no.
good... pass the beer.
let 'em take me. it's better that way.
well, has your majesty considered what napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
yes!
shush. it's only been a day.  and it's seemed like forever.
you were hired to look for tom.
they're working together, too.
yeah.  sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
what?
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  you saw it coming as well as i did. dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. and greer too, except he went nuts. couldn't take it, i guess. could've happened in the middle of downtown anchorage. but did it make him any less dangerous? i don't think so.
is that what it is?
i don't know. i haven't decided yet.
well, it's not really my job to please. hope you learned something.
i...
[and one of the founding members of la hermanidad.]
okay.  what's the second thing?
don't call her mother all the time. it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. what happened to mom?
been away a lot.
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
it's all fuzzy.
stands and walks toward the door.
oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
no, they won't -- i won't let them.
sheriff?
they're good!
did you make anything of the tooth?
what sort of an animal is that?
why'd you invite me here?
okay, i want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
over there man.
now i'll tell you something.  it wouldn't fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars. you'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. and here i am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing i can think is that, in just a few minutes i'm going to take you.
ah. well. congratulations. meanwhile, what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
no.
i don't see you scoring any points, buddy. and you're just the man for the job, right?
haven’t you heard the news?  so is she.
i don't want to talk about it. everything's okay now. i don't want to talk about it.
yes, sir!
pay him? with what? with what could i pay him? every zloty i earn we spend on food!
like how?
yeah, i can smell it.
but this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend.
i look like fuckin' chewbacca.
i don't know who you think you're talking to! i ain't some whore you brought here! i've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
actually, i have no idea what the world's record is.  i was just kidding.
not that.  i mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
closer. lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
hey, i'm mr. sensitivity now.  clear the way, wide load coming through.
that's not how she feels. she may never feel it.
alive... i'm alive...
that bitch called me a bitch.
ma -- ma -- it's all right, ma!
you'll never guess what happened!  i have met mr. right! i been with him all day and he loves me, i know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met be's practi'cly ast me already!
he's a freelance bio-exorcist. claims to get rid of the living. but he's a troublemaker.  he's pushy.  he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne, did you have a horse?
when did you start smoking?
i'm irish.
wade, what the hell are you doing here?
chancellor gorkon, can you hear me? chancellor...?
uh, it's a deep south expression.
happy new year.
now?
well, sometimes ... ah-hah, i knew it!  lando calrissian.
right.  so why don't we get on with this investigation?
well well well, what's going on in here?
stop right there. bring me that paper.
sam, if she's here...
that's all, ned. thank you.
oh that's nice for you.
oh, we didn't build it.  the transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
of what?
really, jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
like last night, veronica?
to you?
we find that your subscription lapsed...
well, you want to swing by the chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
i'm ready to communicate with you now.
seems like we have another one every week.
right.
that won't help the stone bruise. you ain't been around horses much, looks like.
neutronize.  system shut.
because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  and i'm just trying to keep the peace.  we moved out here to get away from that shit.
what's the time frame?
"my dream date with principal collins."
shut up.
school? i never thought of school! if i went to school i could blend in with everybody else, couldn't i?
then go get him.
what deal?
i've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. i want to take him to the ship.
...not enough time to get to albany and back with reinforcements...
i'll call you.
she could be the most charming woman you ever saw. people loved to be around her.
answer the question, father paranoia.
i just want a salad.  you really think i'm a loser, don't you?
i don't believe it.
no.  i'm missing the game for you.
hey, sam.
i said, come here!
once.
is this really important? because i don't think it's a problem.
nexus - 6.
you've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
no, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! if they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
i stole them.
accident?
can't help it, jimmy. a girl has her feelings.
nope. she did.  like i say.  it never panned.
yes, peter.
frankly, i'm shocked.  marvin acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
yeah, right. that's sammy. and he's probably got it there too.
jeanne, listen to me very carefully. we are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  we do so in the name of our holy mother church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  so now... will you please recite our lord's prayer?
we'll discuss it later.
is freddie in rome?
hit the fuckers.
didn't they tell you?
and while i feed my family in new york, you put the knife in my back in miami.
pack, wladek, there's no time.
yes, sir.
i don't know....
me. yes.
you can help her.
cooling down.
you're incorrigible!
you lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? and you didn't get to know him any better than that?
you need that real often?
yeah. just babies.
it was like sex was a game to her. she got off on the control.  she always used to tell me it had to be her way.
what's the matter?
what?
melvin...
yes, sir?
this lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
oh
well, i don't trust her.  i never have.
yes.  and i don't want to know where you got it.
why do you ask?
i'm sorry.  i should've checked it out.  i screwed up.  but that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
stan.
what are you talkin' about? i said i wouldn't hurt her.
no thanks karl.
of course.
thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
i'm sorry. they just... they just slipped out of my hands.
here it is. oh...of course. you're the orphan. i'm so sorry about your parents. we'll try to make you happy here.
the drugstore's closed?  what the hell time is it?
sssssh.
excuse me?
forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "leper colony", failed to receive the recall.
i'm seriously in love with you -- isn't that enough?
i do not understand...
a little.
i think i should call someone.
yes.
laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. see these striations right here?  it's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
i can't?
is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
beast.
yes.
are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
the papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
that's not true.
david!... what went wrong?
is it the machines? the noise? the people?
it was necessary.
yes?!  to be married, i suppose.
you're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
i begged him not to go. and he did.
and not just hunt.  frank sturgis, all those cubans.  all of them in the watergate.  they were involved in track 2 in cuba.  hunt reported to my military aide. but i met with him several times as vice president.  that's what worries the shit out of me.  i don't know how much hunt knows.  or the cubans.
nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
no. you don't.
'no comment' means 'yes.'
yeah, it was.  how you get up here?
uh-huh.
show uncle ricky what you made.
i don't think that's funny!
look, i'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  i can't talk about it.
she's here.
someone stole sid's file?
it sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
and those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? when you asked that question to ben m'hidi, remember what he said? no, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. because the problem does not lie here. the problem is: the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain. now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. when the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. all the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. and we were sent here for this very reason. and we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance. those who call us nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald. we are soldiers and our only duty is to win. therefore, to be precise, i would now like to ask you a question: should france remain in algeria? if you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
i mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
i think you just blew "don't ask, don't tell" out of the fucking water.
working...i'm trying to figure out where to start.
1982! march 18, just like we planned! my calculations were absolutely correct! thirty years! god, i cannot believe it's been thirty years! sure, it was a long time ago -- longest i've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
what?
hey, don't worry.  nothing's gonna happen to it.
i don't know, honey.  i guess it would depend.
sorry, mom.  it was a mistake. i thought i saw something out the window.  i was reading this horror comic and i guess i go a little carried away...
how old is she?
we all worked together. worthy deeds were accomplished. i liked the labor.  my mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when i turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  i like the blood, is that strange?
it is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
that's skid row... isn't it?
i'm not from a newspaper exactly, i -
wyant wheeler represented us.
it'll come back to him.
i refuse to drive in this country. too many madmen.
absolutely!
she part of the training?
no sense worrying about it now.
suspicion of what?
so jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
then i leave too.
basquiat, what did you take?
where's ricky.
i'm sorry.  what was the question again?
where's my information?
i don't think so, jim.  maybe i shouldn't have--
whatsa matter?
i rarely see him, your highness, but i believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
assign another team if you need to. i want to re-establish communication with the captain as soon as possible.
come on, jack.  it's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  it'll be like when we were kids.  relax.  enjoy the view.
i was never much of a sweater. you know that.
this gonna take long?
hey, i'm the flavour of the month!
why?
that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? i've never been inside. but it looks so lovely, driving past.
i can't say goodbye yet! we'll leave it for now. we're not saying goodbye. we're not making any decision. maybe you'll change your mind. maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
shit, doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
nothing wrong with research.
hi wendy.
i had him out this morning.
please, drew.
no.
so what happens now?
how to make a buck!
nerves -- just nerves. you must forgive me. i have had a bad evening. i am very tired. do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
i should.  i've been doing it half my life to humans.
so you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
that was two days ago. frankly, i think this place is a bit boring. it's all white. why doesn't the guy put up some posters? maybe some bullfight things . . .
i do hope she enjoys a good show.
i suppose that means "hi" ?
yes, you said.
seventeen.  she's a senior.
the republican party was never home to extremists.  you should know better. this guy's as stupid as mccarthy, and mccarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
what?
it's left its mark still. the last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. take them into town. get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. it's good medicine.
frances, we gotta do it this way. just remember tomorrow, remember what i told you. what're you gonna tell 'em?
hey, you don't have to appologize to me. i'm the one. i understand.  i'm going to take a walk and dry off.
ahhh!
you figured what?
picks up again just on the other side.
you in a big hurry, boy?
i did not accept any.  i...  i wanted... to.  but i didn't. you know i didn't.  don't you?
what happened?  did you lose your keys?
turn this crap off, clyde.  it's giving me a headache ... you may go, joaquin.
but, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. you come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
what's that?
"mistake"?  what's that supposed to...?
i checked on her. she had the electric heater. cold don't bother her as much as me. which is why i give her the heater.
it's beautiful.
who are you going to call?
as long as they can use you?
you know, i really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... can you fuck like that?... you like it like a bunny?... huh?... cause baby, i'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... jump all around in that hole... bobby peru doesn't come up for air.
i tell you -- he didn't do it.
i told you i'm interested in mythology.  we can talk about it more.
shaw.  clay shaw.
i haven't surfed since i got here.
weapons? all this technology and what good has it done?!
that's also my business.
just get on the bus.
bernie.
mr. harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
nothing for you to worry about, darling
that's in the past.  unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
i don't know.  i have to think...
santos...
where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
not until recently.
susan. what are you doing?
i'm-- yes.  yes, i'm fine.  i'm fine.  how are you?
what a rip-off. come on. we gotta find that chick.
yes they do, they do, but i'll make my dreams come true, you see?  i will.
no.
fit the profile?
is he coming back here?
i said with the mouth shut.
okay, but i'll need you to help. duke, will you take that belly back there? the australian?
... not at all.
and tonight?
no, darlin'. just that damnable insomnia in reverse. i sleep like a baby for an hour then i'm wide awake. you go back to sleep.
this sounds threatening.
nasty cough.  -- try one of mine.  darling, you need to get out of the house.  why don't you give daniel a call?  i'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
well, yah, i got an idea. how's that ciera workin' out for ya?
i can understand that.
how come?
you know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
if you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. you go out and chum for him.
it's always in the more gifted of the three.
the name should be eddie. what should my name be?
how?  supportive letters from prison while i'm being kicked out of our home?  do you have any idea what is happening out here?  our credit cards are maxed. the people at the bank, you should see their faces when i walk in there. i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  nobody will help us.  nobody will take us in.  nobody wants anything to do with us.  so tell me, carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
just some guys i met here... i keep seein' 'em...  now tell me...
to go to the theater. wears i don't know what. make-up, padding.
women.  'bout eighty percent female in greenpeace.
no!   don't!  lasher!!!
not hard to find you...just follow the chaos...
you're mocking me, aren't you?
i... sorry, mister...
well perhaps better than my first. 
as real as any memory in your head.
shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
me, too.
three cheers for our champion.
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
what is it?
a little bit... give me your belt.
i've got him.  the guy in the turban.
schoolboy tings is you head. badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
classy.
and i assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
a friendly competition, if you will. your malkovich puppet and my harry s. truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. not some vegas burly-q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. the audience decides who is more deserving of the title. the losing puppeteer bows out graciously. goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he won't be back until late. you'll have to call him tomorrow. besides, i'm on my way to pick up paul.
i was walking by when i heard a shout.  your men came right after.
thank god...
because you don't listen!
can i see your back?
no.  wait!  did i say promise!  cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
you've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
yes. and i'll tell you something else! i've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
i wondered. did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
clair is a hovering mother.
marvin a. pickles.
then you yield to me.
i had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", how you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
wait a minute. do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
well, a man with some gumption.  how much money you got?
five...? yes. no. we're done today
where are we goin', john?
yes, william, uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
they'll come anyway. they love me here.
i see, a flying carpet, huh? i don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
the ball is in richter's court.  but we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
no... thanks... listen --
i don't hear him moving around anymore.
goodbye, david.
small? oh, i see what you mean. why, they vary.  now a man like daniel webster, if i ever get hold of him, i'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, i imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  in your case --
what if nobody stops for us?
you think i fear death? i welcome it. i get on my knees and pray for it. you, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  she’s beautiful isn’t she? you should have seen her before. flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
my maid ramona's daughter. she's a little animal.
me too.  i was afraid.
gate's open.  i had a butcher's at the house.
all right! don't take them off. do whatever you please. but shut up about it.
yes -- he did.
sex.  of course.
peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
i mean hardly any thigh.  i'm telling you, joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
i like that...
the one you're blocking. this is the last chance i have -- i'm flying back to paris this afternoon. what's your name?
because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
even robert e. lee was a loser.
nothing can. not ever.
i don't know, bob. what about one of those?
new ground?
it's kathryn.
soft and supple. like a lady's.
he's the lamest clue i've ever had in my life.  here's our stop...
they've hit us on cherry hill. i just got word. we have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
the whole fuckin' thing...the pressure's just too great.  you're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  all of them.  you go in the door.  i..."i got to close this fucker, or i don't eat lunch," "or i don't win the cadillac..." we fuckin' work too hard.  you work too hard.  we all, i remember when we were at platt...huh?  glen ross farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
i ain't john henry.
while they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
you're lying.
he can stay home.  please, dad, won't you?
whatever kind they wanted her to be.
oh, i don't care, i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
what's he know?
what?
yeah. it's been twenty-seven years.
take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
prison?
so they caught up with you, too?
why don't you get us some food. this may take some time.
sleep tight, sweetie.
no, sir, i'm not involved with that. i'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. your name keeps coming up.
magua say: "yes. good idea."
not if i find the right girl.
thousand dollars a game.
well, of course, i wouldn't take it.
relax, this guy owes me a big one. a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
you got a name?
not in that company.
all in the cause of humanity, helmuth. or should i call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
i ain't neither. listen here, buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
i guess i am.
brave... that's right.
bobby, we're launching. see these submersibles here, going in the water? take a message.
a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
here, put my jacket over you.
let's go.
it's private.  go away.
the navy will get us to within 400 miles of the japanese coast.  we'll launch off the carriers from there.
well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. all of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
in the closet.  i don't understand, norman -- why would they call you?
i'm with don on this.
what are you doing here?
you did. you're right.
i'm ok, walter, thanks.
the master is waiting for you.
forget it. i've been thinking. girls must go through that stuff too. sometimes when i look at you i feel like an animal. maybe my dad's right. teenagers are nuts.
well, i might've found him again if i hadn't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
i wonder sometimes.
he means prison, mr. laplante.
shove it....
it's a long story.  you know, i think that ellis has his eye on you.
i didn't mean to...
i don't understand you.
these are nothing.  you can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  what is it you want -- money?
i'm a civilian!  you don't have any authority--
i can still see the shoreline. the moon is rising.
the librarian... or the library...?
chub says you're fired.
couple of months anyway.
weight!  hey!  blow the man down...
i do not love you, my lord.
one thing i'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to liddy, how did that work?
all i have to do is scream.
yeah.
i wasn't sure, ken...
you drive! i think there's something wrong with me.
you'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. just get out of here.
so will you, someday.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
i did.
i'm moving. remember? what's with the hooded cloak?
i don't know what to advise my son. i think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
ketchup? who eats ketchup on a hot dog? mustard's what you want.
ww... uh...
it's all right, sheriff.
and - one morning i just - ran away...
yeah, i know. what are you looking for?
no place, fast.  and you're not coming.
maybe, but if you didn't i think you would have kept on walking.
hit me again.
disappointed?
i don't know, this place is really dark, i can't see a thing...
oh, and austin...
another hour of so.  we've got enough food for a month.
you don't know me at all.
that's babar.
i'm dying, claudia.  i have cancer. i have cancer and i'm dying, soon. it's metastasized in my bones and i --
that's ridiculous. that's just a total lie.
tits -- see.
on the morrow i'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
name your stakes.
lay off once, would you?
you've said that for weeks.
and the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. and the third rule...
right. so, this is going to be very formal, too, now. lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares.
ok, i'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
what pipes?
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
getchmis...?
never mind.  listen.  every night people are laughing at your beloved fuhrer.  why?
the date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. is that where you and rachel conduct business.
bob?
you see--  oh, not a word to m'sieu laval!
tyler durden.
tell me, baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
dashboard.
she just saw two of her friends killed! they probably threatened her.
for being on to dillinger.
yes, chauncey gardiner.
a short somewhere.
<i>choco grew up on the streets of el salvador. when he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>there were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
got it. fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
i never get my hair done.
no... no training.
oh.
well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
what do you mean, no???
can she afford a good one is the question. otherwise she'll be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her.
what are you going to do?
i can't.  not here.  if you want, i'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
you're not reman.
hey yourself. came by to see troy.
this should take care of mother.
i just feel like i'm always starting over. you said how many bonds you wrote?
i'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. first rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. where do we stand?
but bela lugosi's in it!
oh, a little.  but it's not just physical loneliness.  it's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as i have you.
that's not good enough.
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  you were with her, weren't you?
start your job? what kind of job?
well, i'd have to see it, of course.
well, i'll tell you a secret. i kinda like the old gent and i'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him. it might help him a whole lot. but that's a side issue -- something i do on my own time.
this is not your house, doyle. this is my house and i'll say who stays and goes. you've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
what will you do...when you find this...secret army?
no jeffrey!!
you know my father?
what are you talking about?
the creek bed --
they're hacking his mind.
on your first time --
it was just after we moved here. my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they haven’t made up since.
i can't believe i had to blow up a train for you.
i've made you silk pajamas.  do you want to change into them?
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to.  what i'm talking about, i'm talking about murder. among other things.
well i don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  you meet someone, you move in, she goes.
i want that story, audrey. remember you work for me.
but i'm the one up there on the screen.
stop...
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll?
we'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
absolutely nothing. the blizzard always came straight with his messages. but wrap your minds around this one.
he never bit me.
don't go rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  i'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
nothing you can do. been like this for days.
when did you make the switch?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because, uh...
might i enquire after the situation, sir, given that i've seen of the french engineering from the ridge above?
not particularly.  weird, isn't it?  god i'm rally up.  do you feel anything yet, mac?
jesus.  sweet jesus.  we've got trouble.
oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
terry...?
father, i have betrayed my family. i betrayed my men.  and i betrayed you.
yes?
no...! quid pro quo, doctor.
hi.
sean --
then whose is it? his or theirs?
ten seconds, rod.
please.
you will have to make all the jokes, because i'm going to be very serious.
i... i don't think i'm going to make it sir...
opera?
fine.  fine.  but can you tell us anything about it?
she loves you.
and the fucking money!
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can't go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?
i hope you're ready for this.
oh, i didn't notice, where'd he go?
if it's at all possible -
mr. gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb.
never mind the 'sir'. never mind the 'sir'.
how do you get through those winters?  well, you're right.  juneau.  what's the highest peak?
not exactly. i mean, he never paid me.
i know. but take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! i think about it a lot...how is it possible for...
would you follow <u>her</u> through an airport?
very good, steed ...
all right. you got it. you win. i'll deliver it now.  just give me a moment to set it up.
wait for what?
a miss sessions calling.
okay now. cases: smith versus state of michigan.
who?
mom?
so why follow me?  escort me, by all means.  following me is predatory, isn't it?
that jelly you were talking to right here?
i've never met him?
boss, we got our own tradition. we call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
this is a school... that's a student's work.  she'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
well, i think --
you may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely marie-louise.
teach! where the hell are you?! where's our visuals?!!
oh, i'm fine, doc.
caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
sprechen sie deutsch?
that creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
we have to tell mother and cal.
what?
did i say anything?
there we go.
if the baron -- if you would permit me --
fifteen hundred.  we'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
and by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
i'll have to perform one of my...operations!
a girl needs protection.
hello, marty, when you come home?
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
<u>this is not a joke</u>!  that sheet was full of ghosts.
tim!
i told you, he's got diabetes.
that's what i mean... always looked like you was just knocked out in love... was real nice to see.
does jackie know this?
no.
good luck. it's not there anymore.
i listened extremely carefully. nothing was even vaguely implied. he even laughed in your face when you asked him
what are we looking for?
heck, no!  what?!
homework. it's more interesting.
now come on - you're acting silly -- 
death's list.  the precise order you're going to die in.
there's not enough room.
yeah. but he needs me alive.
use a fork.
you're really nice. i'm sorry i yelled at you before about it. god, i'm an idiot.
we're running it through the computers now. so far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. it's a haystack.  what's the other?
dad, i'm trying to figure things out right now, ok? it's like, really hard, and i'm just listening to some old elton john and...
then we've been away from earth for eighteen months.
yes but you needn't worry about that now. things change.
we're here from austen, platt, jaret & donovan --
come on. i don't want to miss the filing-in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...
yeah.
the scar.
and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he's got a little something i think you'll like.
go.
i'm on the track of a reward, which...
yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
but--you love him, don't you, saunders?
do you really think that?
potential? i don't understand.
nurse! oh god! alex!
'one that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
no, thank god for you, mr. taransky.  how many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
yes, well unfortunately i can't just switch the "on" button to "off." the sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion?
mmmmmm.
i'm an information gatherer. you wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
it’s over, cotton.
hold it, mister.
will you come with me?
well, i like it here.
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens.
the dead get out?
do you have any czech girls working for you?
i know, walter, but i --
sorry.  uh, let me see, have a seat. i'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
sounds quite beautiful.
a white! a great white, i found a tooth buried in the hull. he must've attacked... i knew it... gardner's dead in there. i didn't see the mate...
i'd love for him to get a good education.  that's it.
beautiful but dangerous.  once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  it's 400 years old.
oh?
i understand, sir.
goodbye, harry.
what was that all about?
don't matter who camp 12 puts on the mound. all i know is when this season's over camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
i need your help.
why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
now you need me.
no, you did fine.
yeah?
i'm sorry.  i'm just here to shower.
he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
it was my joke.  i was tired, and did not care to go farther.  there's not prettier woman here than that. if she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. who the hell do you think you are?  you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
but when you're not. like now. what do you like to do?
so maybe this is my dynamite.
all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick. mebbe that's why i allus have such a powerful thrust.
she told me i have to.
am i bothering you?
you're blaming me? i had to go see my family.
yes?
he was upset with moving, i believe.
what about dr. thomas becker or dr. loel lorenson? there was also a dr. gries, i think.
me?  why?
that's okay. it doesn't make you a bad person.
let me guess -- gozer worshippers.
i'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
what assholes.
water.
jill's really great, isn't she?
i don't want to take any more chances.
where's he from?
every once in a while, a major change comes through. we have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in.
i feel like driving.
oh no, i, i...eh...i couldn't.
well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
look at the gaslight. don't tke your eyes off it. you will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. do you hear me?
shake!
whoooaaah!  shhiiittt!  whoooaaah!
have you been out in those streets?  do you know what those kids are up against? you should help them!
of course you do.  and the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
i'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
blair.  he's gone berserk.
we were romantic then too--
you will not screw this up.
i'm just saying, i know what it's like to lose something you love.  to see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
peter keeps asking me out.
well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
lunatic?
and that's the job? nothing about serving your country?
casy, won't you say a few words?
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
it's mine.  i'll make you my second in command.
that's right. but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
fine. that's all there is to it then.
we're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
i didn't do anything --
i don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  i just want to be able to rub epps' face in it when i crack this thing.
in the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
but you found another choice.
it's not so bad. you may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
that's what you said before.
looks okay. i don't see anything.
what if i don't?
the workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
no.
i make special tea for you, hiyes, okay?  we've to live like brothers. we have to be in here together.
jesus christ, he's my father, sonny.
the tv ... they want to talk to you ...
ninety-five miles an hour...
only the agency of servants.
when i tell you it's open. it's open when i tell you it's open!
i'm babbling.  good to have someone to talk to for a change... but you need to go.  take her out of here...  ... i don't have long.
this'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
uh, i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
it's just what he used to say.
sure...he lives there?
he's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. i know cause i've been [watching] spying on him.
yes.
yes, dear.
that's what, that's what, that's what i was trying to do.  that's why i came in...i meet gestapo tac...
in new york.
are you glad?  i'm glad.
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
how do i know?  but it was from the get-go.  knew the fbi had run me into them.  sonny, i gotta go...!
not a perfect day.
but i didn't play with them, daddy.  they wouldn't play with me.
there's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside fairvale.
what?  what's wrong?
can't eat through a canvas bag.
you know i'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
get crucial. we won't be using blanks this time.
gotta tell you this about my daughter. my daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  maggie may not be hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
i care about what happened. the truth. i'm a student of history, remember?
i've been so worried, dear. where are you?
know what i always thought i wanted outta life, erin?  a jaguar.
no, i think i will, it's safer. i have patience.
i keep having these really terrible dreams. they are getting worse and i can't seem to stop them.
no one can take my father's place.
did you kill my father?
well, i am sorry about your head, though. but i thought you were one of them.
i didn't start this, r.l.
did you really mean those things you said..?
whatever you say, gentlemen. i can't tell you how sorry i am about what happened...
yeah. are you sure mommy's not home? it's very late.
she's evil.  she's brilliant.  be careful, nick.
well, he's popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
not at all, dean.  good of you to spare the time.
again with the fucking china club! what do i look like a fucking persian to you?
down there.  and i'm nervous.
you don't know?
if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
hi.
we must be in the florida keys .				* .  .  the overseas highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
then who does?
listen, there's things i can take and a couple things i can't and one of them i can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything i want to be, starts losing faith in things. i saw your eyes last night.  i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? i'm serious.
it will be. it'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
my dear, i don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
why? why didn't you tell me?
three minutes.  it couldn't have been over three minutes, the secret service...
lady?
all the time...
pig!
oh yes, and certainly _we_ will!
right.
damage control!  what kind of damage? what's going on barnes!
that's not fair.
get your big gun and guard the shore.  hector.  go to your tent.
he was at the campground yesterday.
conklin.
whoops! yikes, i didn't expect to see you up here.
a different one you haven't written?
i guess i'd just be jealous if i were him.
you wouldn't be a widow long.
who?
afraid of it?  boy, i live in the dark.  people are afraid of what they can't see.  i can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  the kiss of death. it's all the same.
hmm... mike and ike's.
well --
do you think i consider this recreation?
we should talk.
think we let out enough air?
...what are you talking about...?
but just...
don't give me that fucking shit.
lucky.
he's here.  check the bathroom.
can i get up now?
how do you know he's telling the truth?
...sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
i'm sorry to hear about santa. he was a good friend, but my days...
well, dad said...
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
38.
i asked you to keep your trap shut!
your government always been pretty happy to have that line. the question's just been where to draw it
yes.
cocky.
honey, some folks just can't fly.
life! -- mr. kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
i hope you realize, norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
come to the point, dr. honorius.
you should a joined us, everett. it couldn't a hurt none.
-- your act only works with an audience.
<u>excuse me</u>?
morning.
is he alive?
don't worry about it.
okay, pal...  i accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
they were looking for wood.
you may be a little overdressed for this party.  yo, tick!  it's lenny.  open up!
no, actually. i don't know how to put this really. well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
that's from skiing.
hey, i ignore my wife too. but on our honeymoon i paid attention.
don't move, rudy!
if he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
you're crazy.  i think you're in love.
is there anything in there that can blow?  we have to be ready for any contingency--
good.
he's excited about the script.  you should be too.  it stars you.
is that all?
come here a minute.
you don't love me, is that it?
why then.
thanks, mr. carpenter.
right?... that i nailed it... whatever. then he says it's just that i'm a little old. i'm like "how old is the brother?". he's like, he says this with a straight face, i swear to god, he says "eleven."
you're goddamned right, i give the order.  vote!  jesus christ!  listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?
-- no more --
no, i was just... how you doing?
dylan's run away from the hospital.  i don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  but i think freddy's after him.  i know it sounds crazy!
why not?
this is not a place you wanna go.
well, sir, i don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." it's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  you don't know what's real and what's not.
can you fax me his picture?  his license or something?  what do you mean you don't have that there?  anybody else in the cab?
what is it?
yeah, i guess.
your father has business.
yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. they weren't bozos! i'm pumpkin ass again!
it's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
you really must do me this one favor.
yellow bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. some gung-ho agent from d.c. pushed him into a corner. you're playing a losing game. pull over.
i always find it surprising, mr. gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the president, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
what do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
is the car out front yours?
for getting a divorce?
what i did to joey.
put that gun down.
yeah. i'll check.
is he alright?  what happened?
and what do i do with him?
now, whyn't you help us?
no, fidget, i...
he wasn't.
sir?
shhhh.
of course he thinks he can beat me, bert. he wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. right, felson?
i'll talk to her, i'll reason with her.
what are you talking abut, myra? marriage?
you don't know who he is?
truman, i think i'm going to throw up.
yes.  that's it.  happy.  well, whatta ya think of that.  happy.
how come?
i gotta go. love ya mom.
sounds respectable.
i've made progress.  i'm in manhattan.  once a few more pieces fall into place, i'll drive to you and give you an update.
excuse us por favor! hey. let tits see her kid.
i have to talk to evelyn.  and i want you to meet her.
-- we must do something...
you know something? i've actually fallen in love with him.
if you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, nadine, right? the girl in the pink sweater.
it... was nothing.  a nightmare, nothing more.  go away, i --
the incident of the other night is a nuisance that i can take care of. i came to you because i want nothing to affect our agreement; i wanted to clear everything i'm going to do with you, just in case.
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
that was about a year ago.
don't, then.
mr. sweeney, how goes it?
what for?
i got shells too, box and a half, tops.
are you with the tournament?
can you watch the road?
no! it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen!
that was a long time ago.
what's happening?
yes, but that was some ten months ago. i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
i got an interesting call this afternoon. it was from a dr. frankel.
so i can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, i'm going to tell him i'm screwing lester karpf!
this one's still with the fire department. one of our best investigators, don rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us: an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
we could steal one of the choppers.
shit...
did they kill him?
i sure as hell got my wish.  she doesn't exist.  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.

this is a very interesting cafe. i congratulate you.
paul gruneger!
don't be ridiculous.
no.
don't be so upset. it's ok...
maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
i suppose you could say that.
with your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
i still don't under --
there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.
on earth -- no.  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna.
i don't want to talk about it.
a model? an actor?
the only thing that scares me, mister o'connell, are your manners.
i'm not hungry yet.
you'll never guess. shut your eyes, mama. shut 'em for little jakie. ha. i'm gonna steal something.  ha, ha, ha, ha. i'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if i don't. mama, darlin', if i'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. oh yes, we're gonna move up in the bronx. a lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. there's the ginsbergs, the guttenbergs, and the goldbergs. oh, a whole lotta bergs; i don't know 'em all. and i'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, mama. you see mrs. friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
think of them as death shrouds. and the moaning is important. really <u>moan</u>!  practice, practice, practice.
don't give up. this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis. now let's get those knees up!
tree.
that's it! i'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. goodbye.
gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
he hates me.
am i too heavy for you?
who?
tell me what you know, i'll tell you what i know --
to the nsa. make a deal. tell 'em to stop. tell 'em i don't have what they're after. make a deal.
agnes, what happened to the baby?
in that case you won't find her -- and i won't get my thousand dollars.
well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
paulie, it's thanksgiving. i've gotta turkey in the oven.
you have changed since second grade.
he's better off this way.
naw. didn't have too much. enough to scrape by on, i reckon.
i don't need a few days. i'm gonna settle down with jess. she's through dancing. we're opening a restaurant.
huh? why?
doesn't matter.  i like change. you know, constant turnover.  as soon as i close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
where are we going, frank?
whatever.  you own boardwalk, you own park place, you own the four railroads.  you think you're god. for all i know, you're probably right.  i just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some nintendo after i find out what it is.  man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  what am i saying, you did buy it...
'...but sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies -- but not your soul. for while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. long live the hud. waring hudsucker...'
no. don't leave me! my invention! i need you!
i'd be helpless and useless. they don't have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
no, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how i would know somebody like you...
dad...
we're doing some serious shit here. now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
the khamba's gun is his most prized possession. i admire them so. they face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
the rest of us see bathrobes.
it just would. he was always the same.
yeah, god, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
i didn't imagine it.  i know what i saw.  are you sure there are enough men in there?
sheila?!
thank you, captain sulu.
everybody's life's got static. is your life perfect?
well it's more of an enclosure really.
but why?
don't say any more.
do something...
yeah, yeah. i'm taking a big gamble. i've loved him for a long, long time.
i always thought jails make people hard. not you. you're just not tough enough to forget about beynon. i chose you, not him.
not at all.
everybody ... move!!
i think it's what you think.
no offense, but all i ever need...  are these...  and this.
you're fucking twenty minutes late. what the fuck is that?
tell them when they get back to the cars.
are you lyin' to me?
charlie -
something like that.
i had to beat it before the cops showed up.  i don't have a cent to my name.  i can't even get my car out of the garage.  i tell you, mr. vesci, if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have any at all.  so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car.  i'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
we're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
delivery!
oh, fine i guess. it's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so i haven't...
it says, "ray."
uh-huh.
scud.
never heard of him, who is he?
10%.  that's ...
slow down a second, you met with low --
you are.
they're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. i'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
well, i guess we drop him off at the hospital. since he don't know nothin' about us, i say it's his decision.
give it another ten minutes. if we don't --  hell, i'll tell him.  pete? if we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  kent,	i need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
she's right. she's right. young husband and wife, they should have their own home. and my sister catherine, she's my sister, but i gotta admit, she's an old goat. and plenty-a times in my life, i feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. and i tell you now, as far as i'm concerned, if catherine wantsa come live here with me and marty, it's all right with me.
mmmmmm!!!!
figures.
you tell me what ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  and whatever it is, you're part of it.
ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
about what?
dade.
then something goes wrong.  meeks gets killed.  maybe stens got greedy, killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  the night he died, stens was all mysterious.  said he had something big going down.
the legend goes that you release the power with the power.
how'm i gonna know 'bout you? they might kill you an' i wouldn't know. they might hurt you. how'm i gonna know?
kill a dead guy?
yes.
there's nothing to be scared of, baby. it's just another storm.  try to get some sleep.
it's killing me.
why not?
listen, i don't want you to think i'm ungrateful --i know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
on my own.
what do you mean, poetry?
what else is new? right?
oh, lots of things, i suppose. bad people for one. people who wanted to imprison them. hurt them.
have i seen her?
projections were far too optimistic.
so whoever did this now has our shotgun.
lady viola is pious, my lord.
you could have told them!
don't try to stop me!
constantly.
not really, no.
i stand corrected mr. decker.  navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
italians, jews, irish. one big party. course, some guys don't get along.
oh, you remember her, annie.
how soon is soon enough?
i don't like the question.
not to mention andrew zhdanov... otis, come!!
titanium power! get more snatch by the batch!
when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in birchin lane, london.  i requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as messrs. sharp and salomon had been treated here.
there's nothing i'm hiding. it's just that --
rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
anything else?
i have cheerleading squad.
when you get the ak, open up. you got me? open up.
yeah ... you don't have rain either?
it's not suicide if you're already dead. two...
such as?
what's going on?
cut to the fucking chase, flynne.
madrid has just blacked out!! nothing more coming through.
sorry.  we had another bat sighting.
you missed a button.
crabs?
that's okay. that's his style.
probably the bartender. he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
you and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. we're two of the most frightening ghouls i've ever known.
"welcome to eureka."
you'll kill us all!
wow.
went ballistic?
i'd tell you if i knew. but i'm not in this.  ask the police.
well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. you're a caring person.
i don't know who.
i'm married, ishmael.  it isn't right for us to be alone.  people will t...
wash her.
you tell me! you got a sniper up there or what?
forget it. i only mention it to illustrate a point...
i don't blame him.
no.  it's felony possession of marijuana.
i'll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep.  even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
is this one any good?
yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! the world series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
jeanne's alive!
pipe!
not for money. with my mother.
your homie, glenn.  only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  it's the american way.
-- but you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
what about me - jim called an abort - i didn't comply.  i lost the team. i just need you to be safe.
they'll be along.
so why are you telling me this?
you don't.  <u>think</u> so.
il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
thank you.
but you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - heart of darkness with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
of course, yes. just what would you like to know, inspector?
what's this?
nah, let's just take a look-see.
decidedly. yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
do you think she killed johnny boz?
then we'll do something else.
oh dear, yes.  you were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  you loved chopin.  you used to call it "heaven music."  "teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
highway 119, just west of smith. why?
mr. donowitz?  i told you, through dick.  he's in my acting class.  about a year.  yeah, he's good.  they grew up together.  sure thing.
i've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here. my mama's real good, but i wish i had both of 'em.  when we went to memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. but i wadn't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. i feel that way about mama now.  mama has a boyfriend now. his name is doyle hargraves. he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. he still don't help mama out with any money though. he ain't no good. he's mean to her. he don't like me at all. mama says it's because he's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him. he stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. i like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. i'm not so nervous then.
only when they make interesting reading.
that's a ridiculous move.
i should be trying to stop you.
hey... hey where are you going?
how long, then?
no, jim! enterprise would never stand the pounding.
don't insult me. get up and turn around.
you mean he's not a criminal?
could be.  do you play the market?
as long as your soldiers attack civilians, i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  and my men are excellent marksmen.
well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  send him in.
are you kidding? i couldn't be more okay.
you named the kid after yourself, huh?
"forever".
it won't work.
but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.
hey... hey.  don't do that.
i see.
where it can do the most damage.
that's right, baxter.
i think that is its hand.
you are very important, willow.
there is no such thing as magic.
that's what they get for not locking the door.
just kills me...
i have something for you...
me too!
why should i carry your bag?  i am not a dog.
but i want to know what you think.
can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? i've done my best. i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts. he got a fee - what i could afford. can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
it was bad, wasn't it.
what?
yeah, once i cut them off.  why?
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first.
and who may you be?
my name is donnie smith and i have lot's of love to give.
good.
didn't this "information" come from the joe boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you shu kai kim, a korean, an outsider?
bit of pain in the gulliver, mum. leave us be and i'll try to sleep it off... then i'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
i guess it isn't.
hell, yes. we've got finals to study for. in jamaica.
i d-don't think japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
why hasn't he got a head?
you already went back to work.
no.
don't know if god wanna see me.
jabba's palace.
i've never run across one like that.
absolutely.
oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?
he's the pro from dover and i'm the ghost of smokey joe.
everybody knew him. he got around.
yeah. and your meter just ran out.
we weren't real thrilled about it either...
maybe.
don't you know i'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
was it funny?
for you! because i'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... proving everybody wrong. wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
cold war's over, jerry.
you should be. he lied to you. so did cynthia.
i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley.  got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times.  i also found a record of your restraining order.
scary night, isn't it? with the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
this is about cuba.
to cover up?
i so wish i'd known.
how come he let you go?
oh, mrs. rand --
i'm clay phillips.  my brother steve.
look.
it's just a city park.
walking corpses are not real!
oh, well.
i understand, but annie, please...
but he ain't seen my heat--
maude, do you pray?
get me a plane...
how do you know who's real and who's not?
may i have a suggestion?
no!
what?  come on.  she's got a good thing with victor --
you reached down into death. now, isn't that right?
you better hope the director doesn't stop abruptly one day, david, you might break your nose.
i don't care, just get me there.
that's the train with all the lights.
no ... i wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
wild doesn't exactly cover it.
ten-four.  don't go. not this time.
and the landy woman?
c'mon, ray, everyone hates the army during basic. i'll tell you straight, i hated it here.
what are you talking about?
boss, are you calling the president a murderer?
is that a threat, dr. bright?
something strange is happening. and whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
i'm afraid.
he's heavy in the halls...
nothing about you.
no, that was me.  i said, who wants to see a civil war picture?
he had to leave early to be with his daughter.  she's getting a divorce.
i have the gun.
what are you sorry for?
i couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
he doesn't bite.
first you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  which is it?
what?
scan for lifesigns.
you broke her heart! you broke your mama's heart. you stole me! that's right. fuck it away. but it ain't ever goin' away, cause your mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
for once i'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
i swear.  i swear.  we've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
but what can we do?... we have to accept.
carrie.
--i know!
well, what then, sergeant?
did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  and that her mother killed herself in our living room?
wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
all of us.  right?
everyone takes his turn.
and now we're all out of it.
almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  what nationality would that be?
not a one.
there was a recipe on the back  --
no.
what have you got there?
leave him alone.
there was a transfer.
margaret.
don't tell anyone you're a worker. follow that column over there.  and come right back after the inspection!
get out of my way.
right.
i bring her flowers too.
i can't quite make out -- 
i was a great beauty.
he's having an early night.
you mean she bit you?
ok...that's it.
she was always a rotten wife!  she was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  he was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  she made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
bad luck for me. now i gotta bust him out of there.
that don't surprise me. if you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that frank burns is a jerk.
i'm sure i'll see you again, too. keep well.  you'd better chain him until it's over.
pretty good.
i think it's in new jersey.
logging? we'll need an environmental impact study for that...
well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
i don't know. it was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
fleaur-de-lis.  'whatever you desire.'
mr. sulu, steady as she goes.
i can feel your desire, deanna.
is there anybody else here?
what do you mean "complete"?
i remember you now..the so called art dealer.
yeah. someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
you'd know, of course.
no, it is. it's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
why haven't they killed us!?
oh, damn it! damn it, damn it --
i'm proud of you, sam.
i put his -- who --  look, marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
i am not doing hearst.
i guess that's all of it.
screamer.
now what?
you know what i think?
well, whatta you mean? i mean, it's perfectly fine out here. i mean, tony's very nice and, uh, well, i meet people and i go to parties and- and we play tennis. i mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  i mean...  i'm able to enjoy people more.
there, there, my baby.
no. yeah, once in a while. you know, like occasionally.
it's never over...  here comes another six years of bad dreams.
why would he contact me?  i just took some lousy pictures.
maybe he's changing jobs.
whether i am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
you seem to know what you’re talking about.
i don't know how you do it, aud... i sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
hey, idiot -- i've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
bye.
yeah, ma, i love him awful.
give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
this brother from my college.
don't wait for me!
to join with him.
what's that, five instead of ten years jail.
maybe i should have left the ball in the car.
from you, pard? never. thanks for the graduation present.
ssh!
ronnie!
really?
i still got to talk to heather, dude. weird funeral, huh?
whatever you want.
just forget about it.
and are they going to get it?
yesterday.
what'd she say?
you the duff that didn't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up?
follow me.
scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
yes?
you look kind of cold.
i'm so glad we agree.
get in there, paul, she's weakening.
no, listen.  you have no idea of the kind of pressure i'm under right now.
say what?
we're here to stay. we don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
you think so!?  i've been working out a lot since the baby. and i've been working.  and that takes it's toll, you know.
tom? only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to sally an' say you was...
he was never able to reproduce them.
with a full head of hair.
you guess? you mean you don't know?
no.  but i probably will get a call back.
i'm sorry about that. i really want us to be closer. i have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
hey, i don't have answers for this. i just brought you down here because of the sword.
then who's russell nash?
what?
they all say the cat killed this second girl.
i told you we know each other, baby. mr. massey represented my ex-brother- in law. martin reiser?
oh.
that's right, hand.
just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
that's not the reason. i've got a date at six thirty.
where's my father?
oh my god, the others!
what about keith?
--shit, who do we know?--
make a left here. i want to stop.
does she deserve anything better?
it's richard ripley.
what?
what did he say?
i'm not. no. but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
listen to this... 'what are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
hamlet, act i scene 4.
fine... that guy's great.
don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
you do?
nice neighborhood.
isn't he...
and it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing beethoven.
um, well...
you promise?
no.
try telling them our names.
i was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. but i tol' granma. i tol' her when she was dyin'. i tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. i tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
okay.
yes.
you touched it.
a roma, circa tre settimane fa.
that's all, for now.
baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  how many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
ice crystals everywhere. this place is a deep freeze.
i don't know!
no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
i'm not voting for you.
that's it!  you talked!  you're fired!  outta here!  get outta here!
tammy curry?
friends like these, huh gary.
yeah, i'll bet.
you did too say it -- i heard you. oh, i love you adam -- i mean alex -- er, peter -- brian. i hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
i wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
fuck you.
mm.
hullo, sam.  slow day?
i got a goddamn plan!!
i'm not sure but look. . .
what rielly?
open it and count it.
thank you.
who's to say he ever will?  he's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- in fact, i'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
no.  nor to elizabeth.
do you want some wine, sweetheart?
maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  it leaked and stained.
they're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
well...
whatever.
both jobs are open, hildy. the paper -- and being mrs. walter burns.
suit yourself.
say when.
still a bit chilly ...
you were going to get my door.
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
as a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
perhaps you've got the time for that, mr. treves, i certainly don't. i've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. i don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? i'll be back later for his bath. and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. good day sir.
where's anna?
abbe, i admire you; i do. you've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. and so i'll be candid. the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
and our assets?
who says that? you could take credit on it.
you already did.
i was hoping i wouldn't have to tell you.  dorothy is really my daughter.  you see, it was spring in venice, and i was so young.  i didn't know what i was doing.  we were all like that on my father's side.
now, marietta, i am goin' to help you. and don't be gettin' carried away. you don't want to be bringin' santos and his people into it.
what are you doing?  i love your script.
hello second mate barnes. i was instructed to come to the bridge.
of what?  what were you so afraid of?
um-hm. you got the five hundred?
and you're unhappy.
wait a minute.  just listen to me...
there's a little girl on board who's ill and...
showbiz.
you don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
i said we'd see.  and as it is, i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  when you've saved it up again, i'll let you go.
he owned it.
yeah, okay... whatever.
i saw an interesting thing today. a man was being arrested by the military police; probably an urban guerrilla.  rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
you already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
as if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
that's alright. i'd rather not know your real names anyways. i'm muddy. look, i'm gonna get right to the point. i'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
well, a suit. there's one i had my eye on.
then you're dumber than i thought! all you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
he was drunk that night. he left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
if you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers i'll have a seat.
rowan's already called the hotel, michael.  at the cemetery by now, i would guess.
oh, but i am.  dianetics, ford.  you should try it.
what do you mean?
michael - i'm sorry...  just give me -
i can handle it --
incoming message from the starship intrepid. admiral hayes.
ok.
i just need to use the phone, lady.
i don't know what that means.
alright, i think i see salvation...
yeah, that could be job number two. i think it's a sewer.
i haven't done anything.
bugger off, you bloody sod.
i haven't been there for three years.
i'm not sick.
you're sure about this?
the train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  would you like to hear the silver lining?  check that, gold.  i've been working with john bontecou all along.  we had a game plan -- acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  i set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
he is sick, ma'am.
uh, eleven twenty-five.
you got it with you?
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. i should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but i was with you.
no, i'm fine... really...
hey, pete. how's it going?
you need me, selena. i'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
that badge--
you know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  kid the new guy...
easy, dignan. it's ok.
this is the police, ma'am.
don't worry about it. i'd do exactly the same, but i don't think i'm his type.
everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
while i find that fascinating, data, we really need that goddamned door open!
please?
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
his wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. the big c.
no. you baked them for whitey.
nine years.
oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. if you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  hi.
brimmer you're fucked up...
almost?
good night, duff.
-- late. five minutes late.
you're still paying for it. it's still your room.
do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
thanks, stan. i owe you.
in the trunk, yeah?
the whole world's a jungle, huh, mayo? dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
yes. very much.
what's that?
why not?
please, julie. this is not easy for me. our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. a long time. it just about killed us all. and stu and i made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
no harm no foul.
mind if i sit down?
we've done this before, so many times.  the last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
hell, no. i boosted a 'vette.
i apologized, i offered to help.
all? it ain't bad.
mr. cardenas, i suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
just checking is out, huh?  how come?
so did my father and his father before him.
do you believe in love?
so get the fuck outta here.
we could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
so, this is the last time i see you then unless i do bad?
i put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
i came to see merle.
sorry to disappoint you.
you can't be serious.
we vetoed that?
please, i don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. it would detract from the game.
yes, indeed. i wonder why he left me all that money? i don't need it.
okay.
i wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, lynda.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
haven't any.
it's fine. comfortable. i still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. when we leave the ranch, i always hold my breath until i can see the motel.
your mother?
it's war. the weakest suffer the most.
green dot -- shotgun powder. for pipe bombs.  a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. a donation to the cause.
well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. major load!  listen up -- try and get it together.  focus!  focus!  the plan! remember?  i did my part.
what's behind that beauty? a wizened, cold-hearted snake.
no!  this isn't true.  we... we were around other people, together, both of us...
hold on, mister.  son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. penny, you give yer brother a hand...
a little mushy.
drew!
no.
you mean, again?
don't be silly.  i'll look out some more suez material for you. you'll be very welcome.
yeah.
this door's locked.  try shooting the hinges off.
oh, good.  something new and different for us.
you meant it.
no.
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive.
how long does it take a man to land?
who are you?
having a nervous breakdown.
he's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
uh...sure...when?
no!
really? it seems so fattening.
it'll take time. this whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
i've got a gig tonight.
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative.
what'd you find, kathy?
two point one seventy-six.
that's just one example. my reporting has made a difference.
you might do that.  get me a ticket for...  no, you don't!
from here?  i don't know.  far.  far enough.
i really shouldn't. i gotta keep an eye on my friend.
oh, you do?
you wouldn't believe me.
no.  we keep it in the backyard.  of course, in the house.  it's in there.
i dunno.  if they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
yes. but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
not without massive sequence gaps!
of course. there is one more thing, mrs. treborn. and i feel bad for mentioning it...
shit, what difference does it make... nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
how?
yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
i couldn't believe it when suzie called and said you were staying here. how have you been?
to do what?
you sure? what about before he turned up with the boy?
you're lying! you'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! you'll be killed the moment you're seen!
we? what do you mean... we?
he's right beneath us.
we shouldn't even really be doing this.
grand marnier.
no.
andy!  you don't get it!  they don't want you back.
yes, your majesty.
s'okay.  i know you still love me.
what?
...gger.
where's the majority leader?
i just want to see beast.  where would you go?
what's that?
well... there's one indoors now. i've brought her back to see you.
so what. infatuation is good, too.
i didn't have the time.
no!
you think i should do henry james instead?
no.
he's gotten involved --
come on, daddy-o. you haven't said a word since we started. least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
you think i'm lying?
he has been attending at balmoral for many years.
no, fish is a pm food.
i know. maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
whenever you want it. the money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? in a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
do you want to tell me what you found?
reality tv and stay by the phone. that's what all wives-in-crime do...
yes, mr. gittes?
your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
why, you sweet thing, you. where'd you get it pressed? 
i suppose they told you that...?
your mom made that all by herself.
be nice to rose. she's never had a real home.
what was i supposed to do?
i won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if i want to do it.
i knew it.
alexandretta. now we know.
you're comfortable. this is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? especially after i got you such a nice job.
harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
in the backyard.
i made a fresh pot of coffee. okra and i thought you need a rest. i'll stand guard. okra wants to talk to you anyway.
you're so full of shit.
what's the matter?  the fight gone out of you?  i'm just gonna smash a headlight.  maybe two.
how 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
forgot what?
that's enough.
how...  how'd they know i was here?
a capacity for gross fund recovery. yeah, we got that part.
no shit?!
it is not dead. it is hiding.
first of all, we're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens. we'll watch her for awhile. i'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
it is tomorrow. four a.m. how come you're so late?
i know. i'm kidding you. chill out.
well-well, like what?
what else?
because i found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
what do i want with a scar ?
vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
i don't know. had dreams.
can anyone hear what we say?
does this look like the "queen mary"?? we don't take passengers! full steam ahead, captain engelhorn!
my part.  beer, with ice and water.
just people. they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. this is why the big lobby, ed. but they put their pants on one leg at a time. just like you and me.
better reassure him.
maybe she had to use the bathroom. she pees, doesn't she?!...
peter, are you okay?
yes.
why are you yelling?
that's my name, maximillions. don't wear it out, babe, or i'll make you buy me a new one.
very good! oh yes! now listen. i'm going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them... um... i want you to say them back to me. do you understand? i'm going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me. do you understand?
no bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
she said all of god's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. i liked that.
well, you'll just have to make do with him .
ok guys...have a heart.  this is my business.
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr. viznick.
we'll do it next monday.
what's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
what's wrong?
no, there isn't.  there's nothing to her.
i never use mine. but it's a good thing to have. just as a threat.
that's not true. that's not true at all. you said that your name was georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and i trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now i want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. please connect me now.
i understand, miss, that you have my son in your office.
shut up, diz.
i wouldn't know.  i never imagined this. not in my whole life did i ever imagine this.
hey.
and?
come on in!
i can't, hoss. i don't talk to fbi's.
well, i guess they do those things. well, i trust you had a good year.
baby, i can't give you anything but love...
i've got nothing else to do on tuesdays and thursdays.
where's dylan?!  have you seen him?
rosen? i don't have a problem with that.
you do that.
jesus, you got a one-track mind. it's always caitlin, caitlin, caitlin...
hello, birdy. i thought that was very good.
she always leaves town, you dummy. that doesn't mean anything. what about in bed? how does she like it in bed?
i'm good.   really.
you don't know?
not in a thousand years.
the shaft is giving.
tortures so arcane, so medieval, even i haven't the words to describe them. if you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
of course, where you been kid?
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
'booby traps and improvised antipersonnel devices'!
i'm happy here, where i'm supposed to be.  but if you ever become a catholic, may i ask you a favor, maggie?
i didn't knock julia off.
oh -- i haven't flown for a long time.
i'll check it.
there is something to be said for silence
ok.
sure.
this is our first "date" date.
can't tie him. either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  reckon we could git him *drunk*?
oh, god...
but really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
where do you get this shit?
and that's why you don't want to be a doctor, fettes?
y'want to gimme brigham's pistol?
divinely?
great. a spirited one. i'll be seeing you real soon sidney. real soon.
i'll reschedule.  i've been working too much anyway.
about half of them. a lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
i shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. i won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
why are you taking that?
sure, earl, everybody knows about them.  we just didn't tell <u>you</u>. come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  we're really <u>in</u> on something here!
what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
would you do me a favor and go to the truck? inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. would you grab me one?
hostess?
what do you mean?
why?
ah - you've heard that?
did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
it wasn't important.
do it now!
i should never had gotten you going on this.  yes jeffrey. friday's on!
why?
look, we just got this bucket going again.  i'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
well, i tried.
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
i've got a right to carry a gun if i want to.
simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? my father is dying. perhaps you should think of our coronation.
it was the best, kid
nonsense!  you must try our hot glug.
we've come all this way.  we just have to check it out.  i got a hunch.
what?  he gonna record you on his label?
you help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
if you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. just what are you up to?
i'm not scared.
no.  no.
shit, beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? it's only halloween.
nowt.
that doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. i won't be a minute...
really.
that could be the tip of a 't.  here and here. and here.
huh.
i could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
well, i can't imagine five years of unemployment --
i'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. okay?
she thinks you went to the police.
that's right.
don't say that!  it ain't over till it's over!

kenneth this is my associate, wrigley. wrigley this is my friend, dr. beck.
tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
yeah, but i was really not good.
hey, you and tommy lasorda. that's great.
jesus, man, you look terrific. you must have put on twenty pounds.
madison? isn't that kind of... i don't know, gay?
success or nothing?
that's the problem. apparently they strayed off course.  we're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
he will come back.
no. i'm going with you.
thanks, unc.
he's good at it.
look over there.
look, i <u>want</u> to forget you, i do. i think if you hold me, just this once, i can walk away and never speak to you again.
i hope so.
give me a chance. let me look.
no!
it's a short word.
to place it inside its coffin.
so, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  did is work out okay?
that's not necessary, jackson---  okay, nuke, now lean in for the sign.
i would never hurt you, liza. think whatever you want, but don't think that.
we got to talk.
i think i screwed that one once.
september 4th, 1993.  about a year after mary disappeared.
i'm just curious. can't you give me an example?
he's still just sitting there. god, this is totally unbearable!
yes, cultural re-education section propaganda. very important in a place like this. we do a little show each week. last week we did "hamlet" and the week before we had something...
i cannot tell a lie. sorry.
are you sure?
in order to keep elaine away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything.
happy birthday, kid.  you want another coke?
thanks for the information. appreciate it.
when i invited you...
i'm a rosicrucian myself.
damn, that's a long drive.
you know, i like that suit, bobo. i don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
is that all?
he puts his hands on me again i'll bury a slug in his ear.
twenty-eight-point-five.

alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
you think i don't know that?
call dago red.

of course.
power yoga?
he wasn't abyssinian, pop, assyrian... .
fuck him.
a gun's a gun man. it don't need to be loaded.
technothugs.
and it's just in one ear?
i'll be in the bedroom.
that's where you come in.  i'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
di?  i just called to say that conan talked about us again last night.
<u>what did you do to me</u>?
hi. you have hard shells, right?
i skipped. too many "that's her" looks.
i always told ya, frances. you got real ability.
hey, check it out...
sgt. whitman!! sgt. whitman!! may i have a word??
do you have your papers, sir?
so that's what this is all about.  we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
i know how he found me.
they're still in the house.
i'm so cold.
what safe place is that?
good. now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
cuban cigars. you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
why cancoon?
oh.
i can't tell you that.  it is quite urgent.
oh yeah.  violet!
well before there was black or african american, there were negroes.  i'm a negro.
oh, god...oh, god...  jim, excuse me...ray, i told you, who he is is the senior vice- president american express.  his family owns 32 per...over the past years i've sold him...i can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  i promised five weeks ago that i'd go to the wife's birthday party in kenilworth tonight.  i have to go.  you understand. they treat me like a member of the family, so i have to go. 
i can't.
the scum of the earth.
do whatever they tell you--
who is he? what have you got me into?
i'm talking about old satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
you're right.  i must've made a mistake.
i don't know, and i wasn't about to mess with it.
actually, that's none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
pms.
you're fucking crazy richter--you know that?
how would you like a spanking?
i can't believe we built this.
should i?
that's right.  i don't.
some of these are so old and tattered. you should throw them away.
it was an accident.   gifford, too.
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
how can we get in touch with them?
yes, of course. my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
i don't know, sir.
my wife is the game player in the family, sir.
yes, but there wasn't a war.
i agree with what you said...truly.
yeah?
you... you left them a message?
who?
then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
what about howard?
stand by.
why me, mrs de moraes? why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time french detective to look for their missing son, mrs de moraes?
there's something i should tell you, judy.
do you let your child watch your movies?
the wife killer?
is that what you want?
you slept with the fucker!!
i'm not inquiring where mr. gillis goes every night...
yeah, i read about that. terrible business, suicide.
were.  isn't that what you mean?  were. because he's dead, isn't he?  and that's why you've come.
and now?
and i worked there. for a year.
why don't we just turn him over to lando to fix?
all right, darlin'.
must have taken a hell of a long time.
yeah... well... i'll see you tomorrow, rob.
mr. kay, sir.
to a private island, like you?
call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
all right. that's all.  please, matt.
i think you have too much to do tomorrow.
if he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
no.
gotta keep in practice.  it's a dyin' art.
father. she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr. darling.
we'll go to venice, to the same hotel!
that's what i was wondering.
you don't move soon. i'll begin to decompose.
except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named sam vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family.
they'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. and they can talk about what they do. what am i going to say?  "i killed the president of paraguay with a fork."
the enemy is matching velocity.
well, there's nothing we can do about it. why get excited?
sh!
outside of this gate... i...am top gun.
yup. that's one of the great things about paris. lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
i'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
i did it for you.
what spf, sweetie?
mr. fitts, with all due respect, i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. and i think lawson deserves the bijou.  there's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
"then have my lips the sin that they have took."
virginia.
i love my country, i believe in music, what was i to do?
i'm not sure. but i think they're worried about you.
it is important to assure the succession.
what about his teeth?
often, uh.
whoa, cool your maples. over the bridge, past the peter pan, last house on the dead end. theo releases sid's hand. sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
frances, you remember my lawyer, alma styles?
not personally.
maybe...?
uh-huh.
last year was awful rough--mama passing on and the whole business with o.j.--i mean it's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
right.
it's important that i learn this.
oh, but you must, my pumpkin! sex without flirtation is merely rape!
i didn't sleep all night.
are you... an architect?
you better take one.  your breath has been a little funky all day.  let me look at you.
i don't think you're giving him enough credit. i know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. he gets too excited. but --
watch me do what?
it's my head, schwartz, and i'll see you in court!
huh? -- what's that?  well -- what about it? who cares, anyhow?
i was?
i only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
don't have one.
we're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. and the perception is that crystal lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  that, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob, standing and holding his jacket.
oh come on.  there're lots of girls here who look better than ...
yeah, it's st. patty's day. everyone's irish tonight. now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
unless i'm not who i think i am.
padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. for everyone.  for you, and you, and you.
you're right.  you're right.  of course, one doesn't want to boast. it's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  that's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
he'll never amount to a thing, trust me. at least they were cheap.
it's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe.
i don't understand.
no, i couldn't get my hands on one.
don't worry about it. who sent the flowers?
can we see?
three cheers for betty schaefer! i will now kiss that nose of yours.
well then how can you say somebody else was there?
i think krueger's trying to do something to it.
i don't know. cops. or the -- how should i know?
sloan is the hardest working person i've ever met.
i was assured the problem was corrected.
but it's not	the money, vlad.
you know, even when i think about your face i get happier.
fuck. i think we blew a tire.
blackheart?
i don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... i never saw the baby so i can't talk about the baby because... i don't believe in the baby.
so what does that have to do with aubrey!  where is she!
it's no use.  she just isn't here.
uh-huh.
who am i thinking of?
the lady of the lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by divine providence ...  that i, arthur, was to carry excalibur ... that is why i am your king! | |                              old woman |      is frank in?  he'd be able to deal with this one. | dennis look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
really, i haven't a bit of character. none at all.
i've had enough of this shit.  you're on foot, lenny.
okay--that's enough!
but, i am in charge.
that wasn't in there before.
he better be kidding!

ordell pick up his bond?
what?  that i'm accused of being a communist when i don't happen to be one?
there's two hundred. i'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
what difference does it make? natchez was better off without winston hancock! who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? at least the state of mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
zorro. yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. thought there might be a mexico connection, el paso and all, but nothing. fooled around with the letter "z," turned it on it's side, got "n" -- there ng, he's vietnamese. the only thing that came to mind was zero, not zorro. remember suspect zero?
sure.
webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  if they do not arrive, the fort will fall. if that happens, stay close to your father.  the french will protect the officer class among the english.
well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
brean, shaking his head.  in the b.g., moss, drinking. the tv comes to life.
after last night?  dude, i'm a lover, not a fighter.
i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  in other words, level with me.
no, i didn't have to.
oh, geez. it's quarter to eleven.  i hope i dint wake you.
that looks pretty nice.
thank you, miss boatwright.
go'on and sing it, i'll play.
they're what's keeping me alive. you think you're dealing with an idiot?  talk to me then.
just like the president.
sure.  come on in.  i was just packing.
right there. freeze.
so, have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
nobody knows what we're talking about, jack.
of course you can. angle - grange in the gallery --  in darkness.  the running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which throws vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
well, certainly... we're always happy to cooperate with the police...
mary robert, i am so sorry about last night...
maybe yes. maybe no.
i told you before, you wouldn't understand.
no. i think you'll want to wait on that.
nah, i need a place to stay. so how do you like being in college?
you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
it's not your concern.  it's... business, that's all.
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
you follow directions good. now let's wrap this production. go to the sunrise studios backlot. i'll call you when you get there.
i-i would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  i-i, you know, i think maybe that we could do something with it.
what's that?
oh, yes i would. i'd know you any time --
when did you buy a gun?
when was the last time you used it?
that's his brother.
that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...
i feel the same about the bridge. this country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
and they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
give us time, harold--to adjust to your being alive.
what does he mean by "target audience"?
only a tiny bit.  even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
i'm sorry, jim.  i can't talk now. i'll call you tonight...i'm sorry. i'm coming, ray. 
thanks.  but either way it still feels...
i don't know.
harry, he can and he did. and now it's on like donkey kong.
no.  i...listen, i can't make it in today.
ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
listen, if you'll promise not to do it, i'll pay you. i'll pay you as much as he will. you won't gain anything by giving me away as long as i'm willing to make it worth your while. i've got to get to new york without being stopped. it's terribly important to me. i'd pay now, only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes. i'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york.
i'm only trying to help you.
i just don't want you and cheeba to get hurt.
all right...but i'm givin' the orders...you take 'em or we split up here and now...
what?
because he has to reveal it in a court of law. it's on record, it's out. it's no secret anymore. so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? it's out in the world...
no, no, you must put your whole body into it.
i'm gonna save carmen.
he's expecting you?
oh.
you must chill!  you must chill!  i have hidden your keys. chill!
but she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  what would the dead poets say about that?
you know what he's like. he just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
fertility beads.
that'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  john's plan. 
when did we get that?
i - i don't know, bill. just a feeling, i don't know...
everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
all right, go.
what difference does that make?
he can't download her without a lot of technical help.
do you?  you told me they're survivors...and they are.  but how much longer they survive is up to us.
chill out edgar.
i have no idea.
wait a minute.
if they land, we can take them.  if they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
nonsense. your novels are very popular here. aren't they, sergeant?
yes.  something... conservative.
the one on the left.
oh he as clever about that.  he called when you were out.  that same afternoon, julia telephoned to him. she said that you were coming, mimi, to ask about wynant. he got terrified. he was afraid that julia would break down and tell... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant's watch chain in her hand.
all right, i'm not ashamed of it! i split it two ways —
they would have killed us both. you want me to write a confession, i'll write a confession.
f for...
please
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
you heard me, nad breath. my time's precious and i think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
certainly.
yeah. i've figured out how to hold on as long as i want. oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
i'm not going to stalk her. hank. i just... want to know where i stand.
colonel, don't you know what's going on?
the duchess...
the cretaceous.
anything.
that's where it gets a little strange.
as usual, i don't have anything to do.
thank you.
in the corner, behind the curtain.
is it necessary to know?
what for?
then why do you persist in doing it?
exactly, i mean, after all, we're men!
true. i guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  are you sure you're seventeen?
they are not.
oh bloody hell.  you're a spy.
right.  why?
i'd be real careful if i were you.
i think you should wear one at a time. one of these... and one of your others. in fact, i was going to buy just one, but i didn't think it would fly... as a gift, i mean.
it's a guy you know.
none!  the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  he's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the cia.
what kind of landing was that?! these clowns are a menace to the sky
yeah... not bad for a city college boy. bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...i just got on the board of the zoological society, cost me a million; that's the thing with wasps -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
i know, hal is as stiff as always.
nothing.
how should <u>i know</u>?
it's her!  i'm telling you.  she whispered and turned on the music.  she's trying to contact me!
you don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  i mean, long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  the stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  you two have to stick together now.  boners united.  united in getting some.
has it helped?
she could have been killed...you knew and you didn't tell us...you let your mother think....
hey, we got seed money for the startup! a million-five!
delay that order, scotty...! disengage all main drive systems!
you haven't said anything.
toasty.  were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
they won't care.  who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
chang's first question was about the pilot.
get outta my way.
don't joke. after major strasser's warning tonight, i am frightened.
you give up on her?
no, he isn't.
oh yeah?
not another word.
pretty much. you know, george, wish we could send harry to college with you. your mother and i talked it over half the night.
make that two.
you think you can bargain with me?!
yes, mr. bernstein.
oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
krueger.
please.
don't make me out to be a sucker. louise bonner says there's trouble in there. you remember last night. sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
jesus...
good news is that yeah, i found him.  the bad news is...
sure
don't lay any guilt on me. suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
from who?
you think so?
it's obvious, isn't it?
behind the books.
huh huh. soon, she will be mine.
you can ask.
here we go again.
are you hungry?
i want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
you do not!
what?
i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
i'll take my chances.
but how?
i like glaucus.
i was expecting you. you are american too, of course.
i don't know about that, randall. he did such a good job on this paper. and another one just came in ...
you mean as opposed to your life?
never enough.
and surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
no.
i'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. murder is the least likely.
well, i suppose we could use another good public feud...
did pop come down?
why did you sign up?
felt his liver go on that last one.  get him to a doctor or he'll be dead in a couple hours.
how long do you think you've been here?
heaven knows. a lot.
i know what happened.  catherine told me what happened.
i don't want a mistrial.
my guards are useless!  take her from me!
what?
knox?!
go away.
get in the boat, rose.
sorry.
it's not important, just technical things. we make our case.  you were very good, you spoke well. the judge like you. it look good. don't worry.

your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card.
no way, man.
my brother hung himself.
you -- you're too fast.
how do you do, mr. rick?
you're sleeping with her, aren't you?
for me?
yes, barbara... barbara...
of course, i've changed!  my eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  and now king.  don't you think this has something to do with that?  can't you see?
maybe i should check lareaux's book. it's in the car.  be right back.  don't go anywhere.
oh yesil...  yesil's his name but i...don't know anything... 'bout...yesil...
fine.  i'll tell her.
hm.  we should do it again.
that bitch.  what's keeping you from taking off?
does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
feelings are real. once you've had them, they're yours forever.
whatever it is just do it. the more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
he was watching a ball game on television.
and where do momsie and popsie live?
mmmmm.
i'm on my way back in. over.
i'm not fucking with hughes. that shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. just like jean harlow
what time is it?
w... what is it?
well... yah.
why do you say that?
i'm running late here.  i just came back for my briefcase.
what?
i'm too sleepy.
who smashed the phone?
you're sick.
...and a russian grandmother...
i don't own no shotguns.
same old reed. all analysis, no action. wasn't that the problem with you two?
we're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  where's the next one?
me, too.
well, there's a lot riding on this project.
hello, how are you?
in a quandary.
is it true?
'e.g.' means 'for example', ray. i think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
i don't believe you. i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
yes.
i'll bloody well ask him.
nuthin' i can't handle.
the shop. i think you're a good investment, and i don't mind telling him.
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates.  he was born on august thirty-first, you know.
will you relax?  your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
it's not me i'm worried about...you know darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. you owe me, i want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  stop me if i'm going too far.
hush!
don't do this
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but i guess you know.
they're gonna hafta take their chances.
no thanks, i'll do it. give yourself twenty dollars. underhill.
okay, then!
up in the air?  was <u>that</u> your reaction?
he was obviously able to handle it.
a bit.
turns out you did me a favor. you're looking at a rich man.
has the observer from justice shown up yet?
my approach?
okay. make me an isosceles.
he gave me a fuckin' a?  wow.
you're pathetic.
doesn't sound very exciting.
it will take them five minutes!  how long ago did they arrive?
that's all right.  see you on thursday.
what?  who?
wow...
knock wood.
they're coming in here, aren't they?
you mean that was a...
well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. how embarassing.
there was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
rex sent me two humidors full of pre- castro cubans.
you think this is so easy?
and bored. i know. but maybe it is something they can...
oh, you're gonna love this:
yeah.
what, nervous i'm going to win?
about seventeen days.
so i can move on.  you too.
now, we go -
oh, mama, don't you understand?
criminals.
the world can wait, jon. you're going.
you're the only one left alive...
we're doing everything we can.
boy, i bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
it's...42 56 76 .
why do you have to rush off? what's so important in san francisco?
how did it go at the bank?
what is it?
mister mcmurphy!
what difference does that make?
if this war ended tomorrow, zion is where the party would be.
you and candy...?
five.
he's fine. we'll come right over.
you've read the transcript. it's all there.
stay? they lived together all their years?
lioness rushes to defense of cub.
they were proving to her they weren't. they were very drunk. things were different back then. you think kids are sexually bottled up today....
you did it! did ben gardner catch this?
he thought so, yes.
eve. eve harrington.
hotel? what were they doing in a hotel?
maybe it's the draft through the door.
you're getting cold feet about this.
i'm afraid this is all for the moment.
tipico.
they're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
my name's larry mitchell. i live in vancouver.
who?
no, not exactly.
i believe i have.
-- i thought we had secure frequency. aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
miss vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the regent beverly wilshire.
it's never happened before. what makes you think it's happening now?
working on it now, sir.
<u>what</u>? oh no! better it was me. there isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
i saw you with a dog, in my mind.
gee, i'm flattered.  what an incredibly romantic gesture. cancel the roses, i've decided to lie to her instead.
i can't find it.
what d'ya mean "what monster?' you remember...the one we madein the basement.
all right.
smashing!
why not?
freddie drove me back in his car.
bird. that's jazz.
no, thank you.
that's not funny
she was about to get married again. she locked me out of the bedroom last night.
what about boxing?
means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
that's all right.  i got it.
homage is nothing. it is the crown that matters!
get a job!
no.
you know me...
i thought that was part of the charm!
no, not me.
yes sheriff.
i haven’t thought about that in years.
crowd control. they handle customers and employees in the display area.
i can smell her perfume.
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. i got off the plane in l.a. six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan.
damn. all that reading paid off.
oh, how ya doin', rex?
<u>settle down</u>?  i got 74 bucks to my name, mr. masry!  i can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
i've always wanted to play carnegie hall.
in louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
i dunno ... maybe they do.
that's not what i meant.  i don't care about the sword.
mr. zavitz was in trouble.
who are you, then?
hal, i'm in command of this ship. i order you to release the manual hibernation control.
because i called up tommy's brother joe, and i said, "joe, she's driving me crazy. why don't you take her for a couple of years?" and he said, "oh no!" i know i sound like a terrible woman...
mmmmm!  mmmmm!
meet me at 4:01, top of the run. that'll give you a minute to freshen up.
of course.
m.f.e.o.?
all right.
the cattle! this valley runs down to a clear creek. that's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
dude.  that's my sister.
but, amy!  amy...i'm dead.
who the fuck does cox think he is?  i never made a dime from public office!  i'm honest.  my dad died broke.  you know the sonofabitch went to law school with jack kennedy? ... the last gasp of the establishment! they got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. and by god, al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
bullshit.
what?
i was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was o.k. by me.  i introduced him to people--even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. it didn't seem to matter--i didn't care--  --until he roped ned in. some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
probably goin' out to get williams.
you're one of us, now -- aren't you?
could you believe mr. blonde?
i don't suppose there's a drink left...
see what i mean?
oh, of course.
but what? we took the same lsat, we take the same classes --
okay... sure...  it's just that, with my old partner, you know...
right, i forgot... we're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the tri-state area.  it's an awesome responsibility.
affirmative.
if you had an american express card she'd give you a blowjob.  listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need i say more?...what do you do?
get over here, damn it! short round, come on, grab onto me tight!
you would, though.  that's what i'm saying.
no, sir.
mathilda, don't resume, please. ....change subject, ok?
no.  i just hastened the inevitable.  he's been ready to blow for years.  i knew all it would take was a little push.  so i, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
i'm only human, rumors to the contrary. and i'm as curious as the next man...
if only we hadn't made this journey. if only the car hadn't broken down. if only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed.
wait a minute.  he was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
kind of.
they help me understand why we fight.
you were supposed to be reading words.
i love this car. some cars sit, you know? this car, a car like this... grows. i mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
don't talk. keep at it. jab, jab, jab. you're ahead on points.
what do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...i'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
those words were spoken by me.
turn!
i don't see why not.
i think you have the wrong number.
....she didn't, i didn't ask her out?
yes.
it's no problem, i had a mother once myself.
i'd heard that.  but she's well?
yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. probably is one of the boys, if you know what i mean.
forget it.
on the chiffonier.  here.
i'm bruce baldwin!
nazeer chaudry!
oh, you come to see doctor lady?
i'm just laying on my bed.
affirmative, affirmative.  turn the kids day-sailing back to port.  i heard you.  patrol out.
what was i going to do with them? i only smoke cigars.
... don't explain.
you all right?
her or me?
if i was, then i would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't i?
it has to be this way for now.  it won't be long.
remember - - viable embryos.  they're no use to us if they don't survive.
i don't believe you.
maybe i'm just happy to see my friend, brad there.
i work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. i try to help them figure things out.
the car is part of the deal.
i'm in the middle of it...
good...i'm tired.
it takes even less.
and when i'm ready, i'll say the words, 'go see the jew.'
if that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... i mean...  my, i sound a bit --
you'd never understand.
go on, zack! go for the record!
oh, if there is only time!
'bout even.
'feeling'?  i feel fine.  how do you feel?
you're taking mom out tonight?
it's a long way to go for a date.
those cockroaches?
why wouldn't she leave?
are you ready to order?
i think you'd look good in red.
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to cross-reff them through?
the captain's been murdered. the buzz is that jason might be on board.
whether or not i'm going.
how can i thank you?  how can i repay you for this part?  it's a...what a, thank you for this part.  the first scene at the old mill...
naked.
isn't that nice. since when?
what? oh, come on. you're not gonna suck my cock?
to the other side of the street.
come on, chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
no.
oh, lord. it's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. i didn't really want to come. i'm not hopeful right now. but i couldn't take the look on my dad's face. he's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. he's the opposite of me, i guess -- all stamina and resolve.
oh sure.  that's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "goodnight honey.  don't forget ot say your prayers. oh, by the way, your father and i torched some maniac last night."
i thought i made it clear i don't want any drinking in this outfit.
i'm sorry? what are you oozing about?
could be. now that billy's tried to mutilate her, you think sid would go out with me?
me, no. you... i-i-you know, if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful. i get too, too wonderful for words. you know, i don't-i don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
so?
the window...
it's a sign.  he's come home.
did you find something?
yeah.  see you there.
will you paint the damn thing. why do you gotta be such a baby.
but not for anything i did today...
you survived it.  it can't hurt you now.  it's no good to dig it up.
old?!  come look at this!  she has wounds.  wounds on her head.  like thrashes.  or bites.
to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
shhh. i'll tell you.
what about michael? do you know the extent of his...
you're home.
yes, my lord.
three seasons.  they found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail.  i was wife number three -- the ingenue.
i suppose we can't prevent that, gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
i certainly did.
herb, it's too much. it's all out of hand.
you hassling my driver again?
look, duff - if you're free, i'm not working tomorrow.
you can always come see it in london.
i don't want to kiss you here. i want to kiss you there.
mom, you know i had to do it. i just did it a little too late.
jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  the tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles, what's to stop talbot attacking the city from the north?
you know, no offense or anything kate, but i think i'm starting to see larry's side of the story.
last year? it was, "buy american."
it was only a scratch. far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
i wouldn't know.  what kind of wife are you looking for?
yeah, sure -- she's very excited.
so where are you now?
respect me a little then. i'm the only life you know.
shut up! shut up your damn mouth!
yah.
the police won't find your car.
uh-huh!
yes.
of the nature of mrs. holland's illness.  and, of course, the events which led up to it.
it's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean, shell oil and everything -
no. it's your fault.
tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
museums... art galleries... concerts.
i was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
what numbers do you punch?
yes, he is.
but what are we going to do against this entire army?
down... there.
no.  she stopped by to pick up some papers.
stand up.
you still don't get the picture do you? i've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
his peritoneum has ruptured...
what's your cost?
i love it!
burglary?
but... won't you be de-rezzed?
now. your sister is missing how long?
i'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  there was no moon that night ...
don't do that!!
no, what did it say?
hal, check all airlock doors secure.
yes, i was given a few, but i never had time to wear them...
you know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this hemin fella...to read, so i read it.
can't help it. you're doing time for me. no greater love, as the man says. wish you'd tell me why.
we're all going.
i know...i know.
what's to be jealous of?
hello. are you still mad at me?
no. poetic justice, though.
well, i gotta say, mrs. cook, you're right about that.
he has phil right now.
don't thank me.
it's what i do. i yell "geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
not merely as it was a hundred years ago. as it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  madeleine, think of when you were here!
give it.
you could. it'd be a waste of your time, though.
you're a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?
then you wear it.
but wishes don't come true.
bullshit. i know a gun when i see one. and that's a gun.
yeah. i service video equipment.
rose, darlin', you break my heart. but i am only a human man myself of the father variety. rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
..oh, you could do nothing!  i can save you much pain.
shhhhh.
forget about that. you run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
excuse me?
are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
i'd rather sit. are you ready?
are you attracted to me?
the fastest.
i'll get us out of here.
hmmmm.
my parents are from poland.  i can help with the eastern european angle.
by our standards... yes.
shhh. he'll hear you.
monday?
what?
you know martha never comes to see me. you watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman... has an abortion. i knew that one wouldn't work out. not like you marie. you got married to god.
in so many words, yes.
because...  we're just friends.  that's all. just friends. walter i get it.  i see the whole thing now. no one knows if walter paisley is born!
we can handle it.
not me.
dignity...

julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. you're projecting your anger onto us.
thursday? that's the untouchables -- with bob stack.
open up!
home. watching tv.
that's because i'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
the water ski show!  we have to get them out!
uh-uh. you're on your own.
well...sure.
it's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. kinda took us by surprise.
work related or otherwise?
okay, okay, i'll be at the resta...
you've turned her into you.  and i may not get another chance.  to turn her back.
you could've made me lose my call.
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. my spouse's brother is one.
i only dream about people who are dead.
he was convicted in a court of law. your testimony put him away. it doesn't matter what i think.
c'mon, lee.  he's going to jail.  you won, now just put the gun down.
we're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
heidi, for christ sake, shut up! will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
i tol' him. i tol' him this is a dead place. like all the others.
see, we're very modern.
the dog!?  you are named after the dog...

i am so upset, monsieur rick. you know i can't understand --
oh my god. look at that.

you believe that?
i don't see why. i'm twice as old as you are. how could anyone think --

dave.
we all end up dead. it's only a question of how. and why.
no. no. be a doll and just get me a perrier, okay?
i don't really know anything about it.
yes.
what?
you have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
paul, we're not trying to blame miss connell.  it isn't a question of blame.  it's a question of what we are to do with jessica.  the commissioner is very concerned.
look, could you just open the door so i could talk without shouting?
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior --
i'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - it's best if we let old bones lie. know what i mean?  i'm working on the white angel case now - and i've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... and that means you...so where were you last thursday afternoon around five...
well, darlin' <u>i</u> ain't your confessor.  tell him you've got some info on the president's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  okay;  <u>now</u>:  folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us that.  but in six days, lord willing n'jesus tarries, i am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  the 3-0-3 speech... where's the fad king, by the way...

oh frank, i'm not anti-male, i'm anti- you. believe me, there's a difference.  kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. pay her and thank her. and is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  there's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
you hurt it?
well, then, what's he doing here?
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. i see a power void to be filled. as we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
please be quiet.
i probably am, but i don't care. i mean, i wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would i have had time to make any improvements...
uh.  well.  maybe you could give polo a hand going in....
sure! listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
stu. that was right about the time we met.

i have nothing better to do, mr. kringelein.
carrying them. they could all be carrying them for what we know.
yes, of course...maybe one hour.
so boring, so useless --
nothing.  i only met him the one time.
how soon can i get a plane to seattle?
jesus christ, homey, you are nuts.
the first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
i'm not sure.  you mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
that's ridiculous.
none.
what?
should never have come out. i should've stayed there, fought with them.
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. under the authority vested in me by the president, i'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
-- but he was concerned about the timing?
good night, sweetheart.
compensate!
i need you, swede, i can't do this without you!
we play hide and seek all the time.  they find a lot of things.

so do day jobs.
he knew.
you didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
just drunk enough.
i don't know.
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
because he's <u>my friend</u>.
yes. you and i, jessica. 
how about rapacious and love- starved?
i thought she was splendid!
why, buddy, shut your mouth! what an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
i wouldn't worry about it.
is that why you became a nazi? so you could talk about jews incessantly?
i... i don't know, air.  this guy. mr. "best of the best of the best... " i don't know.  it's just still find it a little...  humorous.  i'm sorry.  sir.

sue was trying to get hold of you.
cook school -- that did it.
what kind of people?
coordinate what?
nigger.

i¹m not.

why do i? -- i come in here -- instinctively -- first thing i do -- i'm looking for the exit -- i'm catching the sightlines -- i know i can't sit with my back to the door --
i'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white v.w. van? you guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. could you tell me who's driven it recently?

what?!
i'm fine.  nothing.  i'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
umm ...
i call all you white guys "jack."
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

roach breeding?  sounds better and better.  dana?  the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
james. listen. things -- things are a little weird with me right now and i -- well --i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. and if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. that's why i need you to go home. understand?
yes commander... all right, you're almost there. just go through the chompers and over the pit.
i said...i didn't say..anything!

i don't know.  soon.
she wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face margo...
you're not serious.
he was a <u>cop</u>, grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
of course. in fact, i'm there right now.
no. i'm sorry.
what?
well, almost ... unfortunately i do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
they sound like finches.

i don't know.
we wait.
no, not yet jack. we just bought the story. saturday evening post.
toni blake from langley p.d.
i'm glad you think so.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
i don't feel well.

it never healed.  i called her a lying bitch and everything else and i hung up on her.  "click." you don't exist.
you're jp monroe, right?
what?
i'd rather not play. i want to listen and learn that way.
shut up.
i'm the one they'd be looking for.
but she might be in trouble...
hmm, as in -- that's interesting. sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
what makes you think you can?
this time, swana -- just this once -- i must ask you to listen.
well i'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  i get his action.  my stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, i'm talking half.  you put me in with him.

yes.
i know! you helped me go from a six to a four!
richard, take it easy.
two weeks?
turn around.  hands on your head!
that's where you got the idea?
oh yes? -- navigator better than those on richesse.. you are transparent... i see many things... i see plans within plans.
for calling you a homo.
how could it happen to everybody's watch together?
they're fine. everybody else... is fine.
aw, johnny... .
fine.
no, i'm not afraid. why? you wanna meet her?
no, al. whatever we say. we're all bosses here. we don' need another.
i don't care about the team.  i care about the school.
well.  considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
oh, right!  right!  with those things running around.  no way.
papa!
... until he found tungsten.
we haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. they're calling this whole area the briar patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. just get me data's schematics. i'll keep you informed.  dougherty out.
because they deserve to, walter.
oh, calvin, i'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
oh, no. she'll be crazy about it. well, see you later. i'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  goodbye. 
hey, you okay?
you know how i like to make a big entrance.
you ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. you can go down to the sheriff's office.
take us there, kristen.
i haven't.  not like that.  how do you get used to it?
because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
don't they, though?
could be.
most fun i've had all day.
they're ubiquitous.  what we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
if i may, your majesty, i would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
... where is everybody?!  i'm half frostbit!
ma'am, ray dunbar's black.
and yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
yes.
we still have to go?
oh?  oh!
oh, sorry. detail i guess i forgot to mention. you die, you lose. your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
you know what, nevermind.  you're not ready.
for instance?
oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?
see anything?
but -- who -- what --?
who are you?!
so... nice ship you got here. what's our next move?
here, practice on your arm like this.
nothing. i do remember the car crash... i told you... i remember the glass ... i think about that sometimes ... i remember walking here, sort of. now i remember this place and you. that's about it.
joey...look at me...
is that too tight?
he's my contact for chrissake! there's two crates. can you get me into the hospital?
everybody has a great body now.
a couple of weeks.
i'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
good night.
these are your initials, 'k.c.'?
well, mostly, i don't believe it.
that's great zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  harding - call the print lab at the fbi, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
probably.
a hunch.  things he said.  like, knowing how to recognize a phony id --
i'm ready.
oh, i'm so sorry...
ooh!  a kind of recent record!  rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! nice! "let's get it on?" couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
hey man.
how do we prove it?
oh - i'll get it!
the nlf has condemned you to death.
get out of here.
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
oh -- i almost forgot!
well it's war!  we might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time consiglere, a sicilian.  pop had genco, who do i have?  hey tom, hey...hey.  it's sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  don't be sore.
what the hell you talkin' bout?
buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
we appreciate that.
all sorts of things.  you might even remember you loved me.
now.  if we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
you walk right out the door.
then he can move! people move!
what about cable?
john said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
you're much more convincing when you're making it up.
wasn't enough time.  generator was out, what...?  thirty minutes. takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
i used the last one to jump off the cliff...
i don't?
in english?
nobody gets fired. look at me. only thing they might do is transfer you to the bronx. you look like you aged ten years since i rode with you last.
mrs. dudley.
i recognized the accent.
in a second!
what are you saying, that it's time to go?
are you sure you got my bag in?
--you've done worse than let haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--i didn't think that was possible. a conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. you build from the outer edges and you go step by step. if you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. you've put the investigation back months.
you have to learn how to take a complement.  movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;love story&quot; at the drive in, i cried my eyes out, did you see it?
most certainly.
please go on, mr. bartholomew -- what happened then?
it's 'pose to be cold.
you make me sound like the father in "east lynne."
if his girlfriend was knocked up.
my guess -- vernon hardapple.
they might think i was running away from something.
all three subjects are confirmed inside. call off the house-to-house.  okay, dennis, i want to explain your situation --

the grammys. he's got a lotta records up for awards.
will you be able to handle that...?
cotton company --
the police?
umm...
they all have one...
fallout shelter.
-- your mother, god bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - i assume you're talking here about divorce? the very thought --
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
fine...
here, you gotta delivery.
too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
you're doing just fine.
i don't know.  it probably would've been the same.
just sit me up.  nice and tall. bring benjamin first.
not when you have no choice.
according to this, he's a sick man.  congenital heart condition.  who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
they'll tear this place down within the hour.
how'd it happen, then?
just look!!
a blueprint spool.
eddie, you screwed up.
you guess he's your boyfriend? or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
he's a man of god; he's true to his vows.
i can't. i can't keep spending your father's money.
i dunno... because i can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
yeah, well, what can i say?  dad must've had forty pounds on me. jesus, you remember him being this big?
holy cow!
how are you?
we blew the horn resounding.
i feel better when you feel better.

affirmative.
i'd think you were a cinematic idiot. and i'd feel sorry for you.
no, you can't.
oh, yes. on the pier.
no. an old woman, his mother.  that was early this evening. and we haven't seen or heard from him since. i went out to the motel, just got back. no one was in the office, and...
not yet.
no. no, i guess not. i don't want to get bruised. you're right, i should go.
i was wrong.
the only thing left for them is the city grid...  ...they may not do it.
-- a slice of pizza --
where are they?
do you know where she lives?
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade. would you like to see my wound?
--'cause i only know four chords--
thass' right.  i got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.

i used to go with the wrench.
if we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and nato would never trust us again. we'll get clobbered in world opinion.
he's right here in the...
no. maybe he's watching.  tell him you're sorry. tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
it's really happening.
he has the camera!  he took the movie!
any activity?
a phoney? whatta you mean, a phoney?
yes sir.
they certainly don't waste much time.
i told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. like a scavenger hunt. she didn't know what that was neither.  no answer?
oh.
... will perry ...

dinner.  with stan and his new girl.
okay, get in to bed.
no ... no... no ... tell me what's gonna happen? kip? tell me. what's gonna happen?
don't know, delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. it's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
i don't actually think jeffrey's gonna notice.
i know you, lionheart. i watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
'swell.' when  was the last time i heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
what the hell are you doing -- ?
no. come on.
right.
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. we've just received word that dr. evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
son of a bitch, sir.
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
no it isn't.  <u>you</u> are doing it!  now raise it over the glass and...
when you start with that attitude... it's like i don't know who you are.
would you sleep with them?
no, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. we stopped for gas at this place called capt. spaulding's outside of ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
i guess not.
you mean, you couldn't? or you wouldn't?
it doesn't matter, alright.  just leave it alone.
good.  good.  glad is good.
i'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when i'm done. i'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  i'm gonna . . .

guy's the toxic avenger.
queen elizabeth is a man! prince charles is a faggot! winston churchill was full of shit!
so your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
but you did have a salvation army- thing going.
he made his play amd he got what he wanted.  they're making him a detective.
what do you think?
we don't have that kinda time, boss, i don't think prague's gonna be around much longer. i've gotta go now. i've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
you must have been really sick.
and some sandwiches --
so what?
what? of course i like christine.
that's what mama used to say.
let's get cleaned up, kyle.
can you put me in the ring with him?
yes, sir.
6:30.  how do you know what time the posters were torn down?
hello...?
nay, bigger; women grow by men.
you got some kind of business with him?
thanks but  i'd better do history.
and getting stranger. where do i meet this cowboy? i mean do i have to ride out to the range?
you know what sacrilege is, don't you? the last refuge of the failed provocateur.
well, maybe one.
great.  network news, washington... i love it.  what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
the pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. so why can't you forgive me? i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
yah - easy there - you do too!  i'm expecting, ya know.
with pleasure, captain.
he wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
what else is going on?
oh boy. destroy humanity and the federation is crippled.
what?
sure. yeah.
she is beautiful.
you can't.
yeah.
how many generals do we have like arnold?  he's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
when we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
for agnes.
how long will that be?
i'm going to squeeze you, corleone, because i don't like you; i don't like the kind of man you are.  i despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
it’s i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi-6.  so distressing for m.  an explosion inside her lair.
a schematic of the ship.  looking for a lifeline to the pods.
what is it?
they all like this in your family, father?
are we leaving, captain?
i--i'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  uh--how's your father?
i was a hostess. for trans-world airlines.
yeah.  a lot of guns.
that goddamned woman. thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this. i'm more than pissed, margie. i'm a whole lot more than pissed. i been that plenty and i know the difference. this is different.
last time i didn't.
excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
what if he's not?
you didn't tell her?
yeah.
hell yes. because i believe in it. fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what i tell 'em. writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
oh.  neither do i.  voilà!
some kind of power failure.  maybe it's the storm.  do you have a flashlight?
you have to leave -
so do we.  and it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
uhh... nothing.
if i'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
that cost me twenty grand at least.
what?
it's a personal project i'm working on.
oh.
all i need is the radio frequency to track them.
look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, i can see that, i'm on your manor now, right.  so there's no need to get out of your pram.  i'm johnny-come-lately to all this.  whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  i don't wanna know.
do they show intelligence?  with the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
this phoney war get's on my nerves. if we're going to have a war, i wish they'd get it started.
well, you don't wanna trust me too much. we'll take ned his share together so you don't figure i run off with it.
look kind o' natural, don't they, fred?
i didn't know, there were two islands.
i have not, but i very much want to.  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron?
i dunno.  might be a glitch.
why do you all keep asking me?
ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
they're all crude, when they don't work. had breakfast?
by pulling my hair?!
actually, mel does his own ass work. why wouldn't he?  it's delicious.
i think we're through for the night.
i could go with you.
...yeah?
no!  but you keep asking these, these awful questions.  my god, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
every word of it.
who the fuck is doing this?
it came my way. 450 a week.
no one must follow your work.
promise me that we'll never be like them.  i don't want to wind up like that.
you don't like moore? since when?
officer starling. welcome back.
she wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
oh, don't get officious. you're not yourself when you're officious. that's the curse of a government job.
how is it you can look at that hairhead and see god, when all i see is a lucky asshole from reseda.
don't be silly.
i'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
you ready?
smile.
wait! that's an aria!
do you know what you're saying?
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to...i'm glad. actually i'm glad it's over.  all this time.  hiding.  never being able to look anyone in the eyes. always afraid that someone would find out who i was.  never trusting anyone...
you - you fuckin' moron, i'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
first they try to kill me, now you?  put your damn clothes back on.
did i ever tell you what tina wrote? the night she died?
really biff? the keenest?
eddie, how was i?
no. no. get carol.
no biggie, really.
yeah, i do, but go to work.
looks like, unless tokyo lets me start.
i'm on her, amigo.  no worries. gotta jam.
have you got your passport?
i wasn’t saving you from him. i was saving you from yourself.
we're going to make it.
if these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am i?
i can't believe this is a coincidence, mr. cole.  have you been...following me?
well, i didn't mean to open that thing. you can go back wherever you came from.
if you were like everyone else, lieutenant, i suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  take your leave.
it's a dream of beauty. he never takes my word for anything, but i was right, wasn't i?
oh, those. why do you ask?
shhh... it's okay.
it takes all kinds.
no. the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. not my mind.
no you weren't.
money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with lee.
good morning, theo.  luke.
oh...
six years.  ever since ted and joanna moved into the building.
can't.
yes, i remember.  he was all schoolyard. they threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
it's just filthy. people are dirty. i think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. i think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... oofh... dirt...
wait two seconds then go.
what?!!
and now?
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs.
kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. i don't know what you remember of him. but you should brace yourself
holy sh--
are you kidding me? a bunch of amped -out tweakers? it was easy.
i'll see you tonight.
i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie
what?
lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
i'm very neurotic.
she's really a fox, isn't she?
honeythorn gump, is it?  i've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
what did mr. marsh say?
if i never eat at another waffle house again, i can die a happy girl.
i swear that that woman in my room...
it's me, ed.
why?  what did they do to you?
just go!
what matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. so 'tie a yellow ribbon' sounds a little flat. so what?  nobody's gonna hear it, jack.  nobody. so why should you care?
he's not here.
yes.
here's how i see it.  i've got no house, no movie, no gun, and i'm being stalked.  because someone wants to kill me?  no, because someone wants to kill you. so now, starting now, i go where you go.  that way, if someone wants to kill me, i'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  make sense?
hey--she's in a tough situation. i cut her some slack--
what are you talking about? i am an anatomist. i know the body. i know how it works.
he is one of the great poets.
quiet! you'll make him self-conscious.
cause fuck him, that's why.
no, come on. anywhere you want.
get him in here.
no, never.
i don't believe a single word you've said.
because she killed herself!!
was i in an accident?
the nineteenth... how come you didn’t know?
yes.  i mean, i think so.  yes.  yes...
you're sure?!
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
i don't understand...
as long as you're asking...i think you have a pretty good voice.
we'll be in touch, mr. cross.
i hate sadie.
nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the baron.
'57, 1 believe--
forgiveness.
90 over 50 and falling... .
<i>that's the crew. they follow us.</i>
takin' care o' business, honey.
but you didn't hurt anybody.
the least we can do is leave him another door jam.
you think that's wise?
good luck..
okay...

nothing.
ooooo, you are smart. just don't get too smart.
there's a lovely inn just down --
you already in.

dead you're worthless, darling.
you're a good officer, major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
immediately.  is this the daily news? melanie daniels. would you get me the city desk, please?
i liked it.  he's not afraid to be human.
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. must you flirt?
well...i know there were some captives recovered...
a quarter?  danny that ain't even worth ...
sure, i'll give you a shot at it, but ganz is mine.  you know, that big indian plays it for keeps...
shelly?
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.

he's right.
twenty dollars is a lot of money. are you sure you can trust me with it? i mean, aren't you afraid i might steal it?
no, i didn't tell him.  and that's something we gotta get straight. darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. when you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  you gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
what have you done with gabriela rossmann?
johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
when i was a young man we used to recite cato... we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... purity of heart.  i was drunk on something then...
... just my bridal shower.  and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one-thirty game.
what's that?
yeah, sure.  i knew that...

well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
what about you?
yeah.  i got it.  no problem.
what is it?
there's a slight difference.
we cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  you can work with us.  an organized plan of escape must be devised first.  could you see anything?  you want to leave.  you're not like them.  you must have left something, or someone.
no birds live here.
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up.  i asked him not to tell.  i didn't think he would tell anybody.
two minutes, dudley.  it's important.

uncle al-

caviar capital of the world. matchless beluga. firm, yet subtle.  largest landlocked body of water on earth.  oil-rich.  hitler wanted it. stalin beat him to it.
who is it?
i've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
it's a method for quitting smoking.
oh they'd never let me do what i want.
oh i did? i think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play hamburger helper with the hooker's head.
a poison kiss?  you have some real issues with women, you know that?  you just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  could you?!
what?
what do they have to do with this?
a little, i think... darlin'?
you mean we should go after her!...
it is, and i'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan.
and i vibe that kiddo, i do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
i said to him cary you're being ridiculous. you're more than half her age. he said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
and what do you think mendez?
i said i'd check with you.
yes, dr. furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
oh, right! the thing with the thing. come on in, i'll get some pants on.
would y'all like that?
-what's the surprise in that, this is africa?
you didn't do your homework?
my department doesn't have any record of that, mrs. bickerman.
you forget -- time travel is instantaneous. the time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. of course, it's a moot point regardless. the only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the army's nevada test site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
yeah, that's fine. have a lot of it because she likes it.
i don't have to.
he only remembers i <u>found</u> him.  my point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing i could ever have done for you.
we like you, leon -- don't we like leon?
and why's that?
don't! you're making me lose my grip.
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
no.  i mean your relationship.
the grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  and the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
he was killed in action.
what?
if you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says i have to give it back to you.
you on a roll?
okay. i want you to call jennifer and i want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and i'm gonna listen in on the other line.
you have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
you paid cash?
you sure you killed them?
there's still a sex-change --
not that i know of.  explanation?
i don't know...you got what we need?
he was calling from the farm, mrs. brenner.
no, that's really unneces --
don't.
ask him if he got the letter.
what else did he get?
only in bad weather.
i won't leave you here.
that's right, sir.
then you get mom the hell out.  but dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  we don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
hey, eddie mack don't like no wackos on his street.  go be rain man on some other bitch's block.
god bless america.
i'm against it.
does he know how to activate it?
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me.
how's it going?
relax, happy. jim said to wait.
now?
they sure did! they got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? i'm sure glad i came all the way out here to find them out.
i gave it a second thought.
they're playin' the buckeyes!
no.  absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
yellow room where they dance -- 
somebody's got to do it--
-- in magazines nobody reads.
who is she?
senora, anything it costs, i can work--
mayol... mayol... no reservation.
what happened?
he needed money?  for the operation for you?
as far as i'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
where the money is.
no.  it's the truth, really.  i swear it.  danny told me.  he went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  she tried to strangle him.
you're not funny.
yes!  yes!  we promise!
why are you asking all of a sudden?
sure.  i only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
oh yeah?  anytime, anytime.  just go ahead and try it.
i think i'm going to throw up.  i am. i'm going to toss.
well, nothing. it's a benefit. but we could probably get <u>people</u> and <u>entertainment tonight</u> to cover it.
i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
we're what!?
wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  just what are you going to tell her?
she said not to come home until graduation.
fucking amazing, huh?  chevy nova, you bensonhurst shit!  still in la-la land.  look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
hey, jackie.
of course, luv.
and she'll be alive.  up here.
i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can't i?
let me go!
but if it's sickening for you --
she wants to go back to work.
sir, the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television.  you can't afford to leave that hanging.
she'll be in, in the morning...
well... because it's in the bible. "thou shalt not..."  thou shalt not.
you didn't tell me about red deer table --
you know where it is?
'82.
there's no reasoning with him.
the old viktor taransky.  i liked you better before -- before all this.  you were a loser, dad, but at least you had integrity.  i can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
don't worry. he's o.k. we sent him home hours ago. jeez, what a story.
well, would you want him to call you? or, you want to call him? how do you want to do it?
was it you?
i learned it from listening to you! i hate you!
doctor holmes went to get you some smelling salts. he was quite surprised that you fainted.
this doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  they're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. you and i both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. molestation, whatever.  besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
it'll look like justice.  that's what that fat fuck got.  <u>justice</u>.
think about your father. your sister.
if i go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
i said i'd call you the minute i got free.  and i did -- and here we are.
really. so you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
swiss bank deposit.  gold bullion. whatever you want.  you know the city and the police.
i watched her eat the watermelon. and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
what are you asking me for? he's so busy lately i hardly see him. and he's been so preoccupied.
good. i think its time to beckon mr. flemmer. perhaps he can help us out of this pickle.
i've got a problem, prof. more augus- tine than kierkegaard, if you know what i mean.  i need to know about ... demons.
do you ever regret not having a family?
any id on the shooter yet?
baby, don't be like that.
listen ——
and you come into mrs. ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
i've told you:  i can't afford to garage it.
i have met her.  what is your business with me?
i'm thirty-five years old.
you should have seen me before i went on a diet.
i've heard that, too.
haven't you ever seen, like david niven?  you know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
yeah. marvin's old man gunned him down.
awh, come off it, pal.
so why am i still alive?
why do you keep asking me that?
no. it would be convenient, but no.
you don't think we're going to make it.
it's not a discharge.  right, edmunds?  you said before, right?  so it's gotta be a message.
he must have left another puzzle piece.
travel...and things.
sure --
till it's in a powder.  the energy exits within you...
oh yeah. moonan. i remember now. thanks.
keitel blacksmith?
in my eyes, officer.
john's bad.
i wouldn't be caught dead in that.
sh-h-h-h-h!!
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
what's wrong with your face?
serve.
ja! ja! droppen sie dead!
means i got confidence that he's a loser. all the way a loser. you happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  i'm finished.
that's ridiculous.  you don't even smoke.
no, please...
i don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
you know something, mr. fielding? you're dynamite!
yes, i will.
yeah.  sexy, huh?  and here's another: five. that's how old my other daughter is.  seven is my son's age.  two is how many times i been married and divorced.  you getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. and with all the other numbers i gave you, i'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
great.
yeah, i like it, i'm high up, i can see everything, you know? it's the cadillac of minivans.
yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
from up close or far away?
first thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
lois will stay with them.  or we can pawn them off on your parents.
...sod you, stupid twit.
but i mean really... wonderfully...  great.
i think so
up on the coast. about sixty miles north of here.
i don't want to rattle you, but dee was here for the war of the worlds.
th --
but in the same house, you know, one house.
starck, you still showing those readings?
look harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. go slow. call geneva and the bahamas for me, will ya? we feint towards it but we wait...
yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
are those stories true?
good day to our brothers-in-arms. have you come to join us?
wow. i'm glad i met you.
hello, juliet. juliet take off her jacket.
a statue in front of city hall, dedicated to principal dick merkin?
my car?  why, you -
it's the fire alarm. somebody pulled the fire alarm.
madame is waiting.
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra?
how's julie?
yeah, what are you doin'? you okay?
hey, man. i took the kings to the cup.
bet i do.
shall i go get a cappuccino?  ease the pain.
mr nedry, mr nedry.  the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then.
i love you too.
thelma, that is not an option.
you know where you're taking me. you know what she'll do. just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
of course.
harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
get out of the way.
can i be frank, frank?  your entire existence is sexual harassment. i accept there's not much you can do about it.
not a peep.
what?
you break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  where is it?
i don't know what you're talking about.
nods.
george zipp said that?
you mean -- you and me? i thought you were taking the branch manager from kansas city --
honor thy mother and thy father too don't kill, don't steal, it's bad for you
you weren't disappointed in her, then.
is it true that you launched an attack on paris?
i am sitting.
we have to go in the basement.
how do you people expect this to work? the sheriffs have a crisis response team here.
i know. he has it sent out.
it's... too slow.
no...i wanna go! i wanna go now!
oh no.  we'll always be together.
i don't care what i said. i can't strangle him, can i!
no good?  this is a disaster!
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  i can't wait any longer.  i was wrong to let you go.  come back with me.  you'll be happy in the desert.  you'll be free there.
i don't... why... why do you do this?
all i know is he did it. i am satisfied.
soon.  soon.
gay movies.
thanks.
that you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. there's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. you're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
that blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. the proteus may already be destroyed...
kristen got a quote?
i'd like you to keep a journal.
yeah.
there's food in the fridge. i won't be long.
i'm sure i don't know, freddie.
that's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
sod that.  gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where i've skived off to.
yes, madam. and now madam will sleep. it is not long 'till the train.
what's that?
how do you mean?
how should i know?  it's broken. see what you can do.
i am trying.
yes, it did.
i can leave anytime i want.
well, it's almost over.  we've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  but with that training out of high school gone, what's going to happen to us?  we all know what the answers are.  we want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  but what if that doesn't happen?  i have, i have to be honest though, i have all the hope and ambition in the world.  but when i think about the future, the truth is, i am really...scared.
but not you.
sure it is, sweet pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'puget dudes.' they'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
what did they ask?
feel? i dunno... happy.
bravo!
that's because they've only seen it once.  but i'll do it again, and again, and again...  they'll catch on!
come on, doolittle, give it a name.
if they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
no.  not yet...
betty elms.
meaning?
does that hurt?
i'll see you in my dreams.
alright.  please don't tell ryan i'm drinking.
racist asshole came at me.
get her the fuck out of here. get her out of here.
like you said-she snowballed him.
he heard.
i was a great dancer...
who better to usher in the blood tide?
then you should stay here.
i know. i tried that.
no money, eh?
wait a minute, wait a minute. what's going on here? did you come back here just to see her again?
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
give me my goddamn life back!
walt!
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
i don't know. i just didn't wanna win like this.
that song did not come up in my research, captain.
and you believe that?
toilet clogged.  short fat turd.  let's get out of here.
it's only ten o'clock.
cops don't do nothin.
but there's so much to tell you --
how?
all i know is carmen's going to be a citizen, and i don't think it'll work out for us if i'm not.
stay with us, then, dorothy.  we all love you.  we don't want you to go.
i have no idea.
thirty years. maybe more.
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
i want to go home now.
no!  jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
edward bloom.
yeah. what's your girlfriend's name?
there's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  think about it.  there's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  i want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again i'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
as far as you trust me.
you never disappointed me.
so you haven't heard this record yet?
will you take me home?
i didn't think they'd really do it.
dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. you of all people should know that.
no, honey, it's the police.  hello, officers.
interesting.
"a history of the united states, volume i." if you want to read a real history book, read howard zinn's "a people's history of the united states." that book will knock you on your ass.
oh, i think you already have.
no, i don't.
and look what happened to that.
the extortion, the threats ...
admiral? he didn't tell you how <u>admiral</u> kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
sorry. forgetful.
why?  because they're stupid. "where were you last night..."
no, i do drink, i'm just not drinking now.
sometimes.
heather.
yes. uh, how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him?
good.  now take the forceps, and remember, vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  i've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  there are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
how about i pick one out for you?
what are you talking about!
we have to go now.  we're on the lamb.
...but?
what does it say?
that'll make the folks very happy.
we've already met.
i am not john wayne.  there is no "s" on his chest.  we get down if the play calls for it.  but we are into business and making money.
that's right. i'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. we gotta deal?
frank.  where’s alan mintz?  is he here yet?
fuck off.
where to? are you going to go get a gram?
no, i'm serious.  i just got my mustache wet.
they don't have any shit.
why, you <u>whore</u>!
what are you going to do? shoot him?
plenty.
no shark fin, no camel hump.  what you listenin' to?
and i like you.
but it's ten-thirty at night.
and her fiancé!  how nice.  i hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
i want to see stew smith. oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith.
i wasn't talking about anything.
good night.
depends on the question.
it's all right, mickey.
that's all right, captain...i don't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch...
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
lowell!
mothafucker! you just set bobby seale up to be kidnapped. they dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in chicago. how much the pigs pay you for this one, judge? 
... alright.
answer the fucking question!
what the fuck are we doing out here?
james...
it was a play.
-- we're evacuating the building --
it is really weird looking. it's like it's not even real. i can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
--stories... you brought me back. your love brought me back. back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
you've got to come. you've got to give me away.
do i give a shit?
go on, answer him when he talks to you.  tell him: columbus, marconi... garibaldi.
please see to mister bromden.
a sign on him?
yeh. er, and my boss, mr. schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man delaney—
no! i -- all right, look, if you hear from ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
yes, i know them --
christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. or not believe. judaism there's nothing.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
like what?
i'm a woman, martie...  we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...when you're little we even wash <u>you</u>....how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i'll never know...
would you like to see my passport?
last one down springs for room service.
i have a half brother.
yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
i dunno.
if you say so.
the chief-inspector thought you might need a hand.
well, i'm starving.  will you at least buy me a hamburger?
but now, you must go... i give you the pearls. but now you must go ---
what do you mean by coming in here when i'm playing?
hey, fuckball, i don't need your permission. l.a.'s an open city.
ah.  the director of "glen or glenda."
thus..... with a kiss...... i die.
i've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
yes, saavik, go ahead...
no... no...
and why should we believe you?
but you took his orders.  he was directing the autopsy.
because it's my phone.  yes... mrs. dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  see you soon.  thank you.
mmm, not really. but you're gonna love this one.
that's him. how do you know 'em?
-- he's gettin' good on those eggs. and y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
i don't know, i don't care.
ok.
yes.  i heard this morning.  washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
you've no need of your weapons with me gurney halleck.
rudyard kipling?  no shit?  listen, we just need a minute of your time...
so we'll...radiate some more?
yes. i'll tell you.
certainly, my son, certainly. is there something troubling you, my son? don't be shy to speak up. remember, i know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
he certainly could. about a month.
about what?
and tell him not to delay.
what is it now?
tell me what you were gonna say. go ahead.
well, thanks for the lift.
we're going to register. as man and wife. and get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
i'm not saying that, i'm sorry --
i have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
that's crazy, dennis.  the cops will see us.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
how would we cut off the lysine?
it wants me. i have to go.
harold!
three hundred people watched? nobody did anything?
he has to. that's predestination. if god is omniscient, if he knows everything -- and he wouldn't be god if he didn't -- then he must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
and be crushed.
er. well, nowhere special.
he's alive!
why do i have to do this?
we will have to try again. his knowledge is great. without it, we cannot hope to win.
no. could be someone's missin' maybe.
it's so hard to believe.
aganishish? yeah, that sounds like john.
i'm making you uncomfortable.  baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
no she didn't; that's a lie.
did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. if you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
hello, mother.
he called her.
no i don't.  i don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
there was blood everywhere, rosa. i saw it, i think i watched the whole thing happen... oh my god...
i can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
that's nice.
can you handle one of these?
... it's time to get this society back on track!
i'll page him.
i used to have those feelings, too. but that's when i'd think of mom. her strength...and courage.  and i'd pray that maybe i'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  and the bad thoughts would go away.
who's there?
- - barfs them up - -
maybe.  point is...not me.
hi, kiddo.
i'll keep in contact. you have the bridge.
i see.
this here's a strike.
plan to.
i didn't hear me say tonight.
i just need to talk.
nothing. hold please.
i bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  movie stars?
exactly.
okay.
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
if he were, he'd be dead by now. you'd be a widow.  you'd have no problem.
are you the high lama?
not now, donnie. it isn't a good time.
tell me what happened.
why you drinking so much?
free-lance?  oh really?  you think i don't see?  you think i took vows yesterday?  i know what you're up to. you and reverend mother.
you're an interior decorator, right?
you know she married baby suggs' boy.
i'll take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.
right. freezers. imported foods.
why?
the hell he will!  fire him, too.  if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department, fire the sonofabitch!  and ...
if we could lure him away from the bridge...
good!  i'm gonna be there.
really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
i have a pretty good idea. ordell ain't no bootlegger and i doubt he's smugglin' cuban cigars. so that only leaves one thing an a.t.f. man would be interested in.
keep talkin'.  i like hearin'.
let a thousand flowers bloom. chairman mao.
when you fall asleep tonight, i'm gonna fart in your face.
why me?
you did the same to your god!
she's there with you?  she's there with you?
because i don't have the right name?!
it was fifteen minutes late.
he work for us?
i don't consider you the enemy, ellie.  i'm not 'out to get' technology.  i only ask the question:  does it have to have all the answers?  i look out there and i see so much emptiness... people are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
she went.
becky was my only shot at state!
yeah, i've always been able to make my way in the world.  i don't like having to rely on other people.
) if you could have seen your face when i told you good night! you looked so, so... ah!
don't you agree?
sooner than the fall.
that's very important to you, isn't it? home.
why, just look at all this. you got your kitchen --
zero risk.
better luck next time.
how many turtle eggs you think are in here?
'that's my car, motherfucker.'
i think you can. in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. he doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
don't know.
do you want to learn or not?
that would be mrs de moraes mother, sir. mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter.
i've been saving it. for the right moment.
pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
double homicide.  a year ago. las halloween.
all right, ed.  call sergeant vincennes.
on the nose!  i said place.  place it on syphon.  that horse is going to run second.
if i eat it i'll throw up.
what is it?
yeah.  it's a fact.
what's with you?
not very.
what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
that's right.  and we all have to sleep, eventually.
but there are eighteen patients on the ward, mister mcmurphy.
gonna make ogre-stew!
he's not sorry, okay, fine.  why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? i'll work on getting a specimen, i'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. okay? everybody happy?
susie, i was there for our sake, too.  but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  by the way, i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
oh, yes, it's great.
are you watching a porno movie?
trip? what do you mean, nick? you said you'd be --
thank you so much.
i am sorry...
you sure?
yeah, it was.  for a writer nothing's sacred.  no, nothing at all.
excuse me? are you talking to me?
umm-hmmmm.
listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. it's terrible.
you have the key, mr. mcallister.
i don't want robert.
bobo wants you to go on to delmar.
we're doing episode 31, jason?
mph rmph rmph rmph rm!!!
what're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
he can't hear you.
all the time. it's always "loma vista" this, "loma vista" that.
they tried to kill you?
poor thing, don't cry, rose. i know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. who's the father, dear?
general formica won't let me die out here.  i'm his fiancee.
i'd forgotten that.
one had better legs.
eight and a half?
i don't even know if it is my book. the bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  it's mine now. i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. i'm dying for rain - of course i'm dying anyway - but i long to feel rain on my face.
well, i can tell you some stories –
of course. he saw you moving yours.
i did.
they haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
great. who's been doing your hair?
excellent! now, say... "hello"
a dog pissed on me!!  i'm gonna sue you for this!  you violated my civil rights!
you won't have any trouble finding it.
shh! is that so hard to believe?
should i?
the power to negotiate.
very romantic setting.
what did you say?
then i suppose it was me. get in, harold.
they're not gone, they're here.
sure am.
i must be gone and live, or stay and die.
mulet.
are you guys sluts too? huh huh huh.
but what?
no.
it's alice, ain't it?
same as everyone else.
oh my god.
the cenobites. it's only a matter of time before they find i've slipped them. i have to get away from here.
october-ish.
looks like they damaged the silo...
it doesn't.  they ask you.
not really. i met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
y'all getting any rain up your way?
when i was twenty.
yeah. if i remember anything... i call ...you
don't push me, duff.
"a mule is an animal with long funny ears."
you only met him once .
he was a good judge, but that was a long time ago.
so you're really getting married?
is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
well... heck, this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  i'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
well, i've been on a diet since i was nineteen, which means basically i've been hungry for a decade.  i've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
you can't trust you with anything, norm, if you've lost him, i'll cripple you.
city-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
it's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. how did we do it? five people in these little rooms.
kansas?
brilliant. this is so much fun. i never want it to end.
you won't see paulie anymore.  he's sick for good this winter.
that's the girl i love.
what better place than this? to stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
i wasn't there. like i was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. like i was invisible.
it's not charlie. it's me.
it belongs to pop.
what the hell do you think you're doing ...?  what's going on here ...?
the process is known as "impact boosting..." while not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. there's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
andy?  when a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  you look under the bad.  i'm three years old.  call the prison.
okay.
assuming we can trust joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? he's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. even if joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... jesus christ! i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. if i was him, i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
i think you liked it with him.
it's common knowledge you hate children and animals. why are you back in metropolis?
yes.
yeah - bill - how are you?  you okay?
it's over.  we have to give up.
you're just doing your job.
no.
how 'bout manson?
did he come home with you? did you go to his apartment?
these are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
hello, anna.  delighted to meet you.
discourage it.  but stay with her if you can't.  call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  she's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
but you're a superhero.
yeah. hi. thank you for seeing me.
no.  go ahead.  really.  ladies first.
positively not!
you ask me out here to sell me your house, frank?
no, i don't want any clothes! i don't want anything! i want to get out of here!
let me.
in the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  the selection process was entirely random.  we did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
what goddamn right do you have to take him?
i don't believe it.
yeah!...getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. but coming back! the saints stand there watching you, that's all! god's will be done.
can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? being cool is hard on your body.
you know where she is?
daddy's dead.
say fuck.
a deal?
there are worse things than vampires out there.
huh?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
behind you!
i don't believe you.
look... you... take her and get the hell out of here. i'll keep 'em busy.
no! shouldn't be no days! you know all about it and don't give him a hand? that don't sound like you, ella. me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! a working man who can pay his own way?
i don't pretend i came over on the mayflower--
sure, sure.
i tried your atm pin. i gotta kill an hour. let's grab a beer.
hesh up! be still now! drown 'em! drown 'em! drown –
that's just the way i am!
happy new year.
go on talkin'. you're talkin' yourself right into the river. go on, go on... .
receiving.
a lot of cakes.
"yeah, right"... well why not?  what's so wrong with me?
you know what the word glimpse means, j? it’s by nature an impermanent thing.
you know meyerling?
thank you.
ya catch any fish?
once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
she understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it.
what's mig one doing?
never say anything unless you have to.
they left me stranded.  twice. what have you got to lose?
the plan is... you go.
well, if it's a real mourning ring,. i'm going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish.
you know what i'm going to do?  i'm just going to take a second.  i want to look at the gold.
mr. thomerson, i...
how?
goodbye.
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
. i saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
yeah? who was he talking to? acheson? come on, o'donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. what's acheson doing in town? and don't give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks. acheson's mr. cold war.
good. because i've been waiting to see your art projects all week and i'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
frida, this hair thing is all in your head. you're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
i'd kill ya.
my name is louis peluso.
there's an old cemetery on this road. i've been there before.
they got their stories straight.
i - i guess i fell asleep.
hey, guys, i got a game to pitch.
maybe it wasn't her that paid him. maybe the money was for somethin' else.  how the fuck do i know? i'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
no.
did you guys hook up or something?
very graceful. perfect form.
he's trying to make it.
no, uh, nobody. it's, uh, it's my birthday this week and sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
i should go to the house, get breakfast.
huh?
shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
that's great.  let's do a take.
that's cool.
i am, as a matter of fact.
i lost him?  i lost him?
and what's that mean?
oh. did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
i'd like to eat something before i go back to work.
me?
hello.
what's wrong?
so you think you can get me?
jews and negros don't win elections, henry.  better to hang them around the democrats' necks.
you came here to look at me, will. to get the old scent again, didn't you?
i think i'll hang around.
several indiscriminates and one primary who we've id'd as robert dean. a crystal city attorney.  mr. reynolds?  sir?
well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak english right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause i don't speak french or whatever', and the other guy goes something in paris talk, and i go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and i go 'make me'.
but that was her order!
if there is one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
why the fuck would i do that?
either that or she'll be in jail.
well, i'm glad about that.
do you know what you were kidnapped by?
i'm not into finger foods.  too fussy.
alright.
an' you won't let nobody touch me?
il signor ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate.
i don't know...
i more than liked it.
shit.
burnett?  they want 22% of the value on loads they run into south florida.  it's the juarez cartel model. they guarantee the loads.  the upside is our risk goes to zero. that frees-up capital.
i think i already have.
no, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
do you see me talkin'? huh?
but it's breakfast for supper. your favorite, paulie. i made french toast and sausage. patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
something....happened --
you do?
somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. tropical!
okay, you’re right, we’ve been dancing around this for years...
yeah. good bye.
it's the legendary black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  at that moment there is a yell and a scream out of vision.  arthur turns. | |                              arthur |      who was that? | |                              hector |           |      it was sir alf. | |                              arthur |      i didn't know we had a sir alf. | |                              hector |      he was feeding it bread. | |                              arthur |           |      well, that was a very silly thing to do.  now the rest of you stand |      well back from the black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              hector |      aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              robin |      look out. | |  the animation monster starts lumbering towards them.  the knights retreat |  into the darkness of the cave. | |                              gawain |           |      it's only a cartoon. | |                              arthur |      sh!
you were with him?
i know that sounds rough but i'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and i'm mortgaged up to my ass. if this deal goes south, i'm ruined -- i'll lose millions.
look, it's really not my fault.
hi. well, nice to see you guys here. bye, miles.
the exact words of the text. but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?
either do you.
thank you.  i owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
yup.
<u>shifty</u>.  who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
...since caitlin.  you don't remember this?
i think that’s disgusting.
what's burke got to do with it?
yes!
we'll use the euc.
your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. sure wish i could have met him --
yes ...  fits better in a football helmet.
what mess?
good night.
yes. but i can't tell you what it is.
landon. i can't even do for myself.
i don't know.
well...
you have fed. you were made for this...
what if it wasn't you that i came back to see?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
can anybody hear me!
is he your friend?
covered.
it's a rob roy. a very popular drink, i'm told.
we can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for dr. oliver harmon jones.
it means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
no momma.
yeah boss?
yeah, geography.
well, i can see this is pointless...
not your concern.
i'll let the senator tell you.
wait a minute, god-damn-it. do you think i want to go to some god damned party? i'm trying to get that god damned shop open. i'm trying to get a little bread together. that's all i'm doing.
bring your rifles, that's all.  take us to him.
i think he's feral.
i don't know.
he said he's coming back!
we can't begin this way. let me turn on the light.
what makes you think i'm not?
it is the way of all invaders. those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  that's not what student government's about.
no.
no, i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i've been shown.
once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
i don't know. there's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
he electrocuted someone?
where is he?
father perrault! i envy you. i talked to him last night.
yep.
thirty-two dollars.
hold on, hold on. i'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and i think you are.
ca-na-da...
didn't tell you of what she did?
barzini.
you want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
one sixth the speed of sound!
she can't quit.
[and?]
i was working with a boy named eugene.
yeah.
can't help you.
i am an expert!
stop, or i'll burst out crying.
phone security systems, everything works.  you ask for it, we got it!
the conference, oh yeah. fine. we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
i bet you haven't had lunch.
-- permanently?
stay put.  keep the camera trained on...
i'd be careful if i were you. god knows what he's up to.
and far too aggressive.
turn on the headlights. see if anything is out there.
exactly!
no... no. it is just the english way.
we can take her out to red rock. find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
that's right...don't ever think that you and i are the same - we're not even remotely similar. i did what i had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. my husband was sick -
let's see now. the co-pilot had fish. what did the navigator eat?
yeah.
yes, and it's very bad. it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
calendar?
who said i was a lady?
yes. i am very hungry.
that was code for "i like you."
how about that talent?  this is like falling into a tub of butter.
"my dear"...
"oh!?" what is "oh?" what does "oh" mean?
no need to be modest, brian.
oh.  oh, that's a good one.
ok. increase the peace.
what if you don't?  then i'm fucked. you see...?  then it's my job. that's what i'm telling you.
what do you mean?
rose.
you've just made a war that you cannot afford.
who don't work?  let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  no elevator either and shit.
fancies himself a gambler, huh?
they are also very religious.  so, we will attack them three days from now, on christmas.  one force under me, and another to the south under colonel cadwalader...
you're the devil, aren't you? that's who you are.
but i want to help, i want to.
do you feel good about it?
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. especially king’s daughter.
how would you approach him? hello, mr. macdougal, i'm gin, would you steal a painting with me?
good thinking. we'll disguise ourselves as a gentile couple to pass undetected. now that he thinks i'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
mom!
what's the difference? you got a pool cue, balls on the table. all you gotta do is get the feel of it.
yeah.
how long have you been smoking?
can i talk to you?  when you're there.
that's right.  we were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and i told him what a bright boy you were.  they're always on the lookout for young executives. bud thank you, mr. kirkeby.
wait! don't go in! it's a trap!
yo, rocky -- look at this mirror. i'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
i'll tell you when.
agnes, who did this to you?
i'm trying. i'll see you tomorrow. 
why?
that's right. who are you?
from tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! is master shakespeare not handsome?
i sure would.
what danger?
you don't remember?
i vouch for grimsrud. who's his buddy?
let's move out!
cut it out!
oh my god, that's him!
are you married, mr.  -- ?
sure.
the law is the law. good-bye, mary.
fair's fair.
where to?
queen bavmorda transformed her.
no. this is the end of the road. there's a dead human being here. for all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
harry?  what can i say about harry?  he's a sales rep for a computer company.
what, "the truth"? please. there are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. things are not what they seem.
did she water this plant?  it looks a little bent out of shape.
a black thermopod here?  on earth?!  why, john gomez?  why?
huh?
it's okay.  he is an asshole.  most of the time i just let it slide.
--this'll only take one second--
look at that.  get a gander.
did he give any reason?
did you hear me?  get dr. raymond! now!!
we will?  the symphony?  okay.  i'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni.
i -- i'm not sure if i'm supposed to tell you or not.
well what do you think happens when you die?
look, kicks, have i ever done anything to hurt you?
people might be better off.  they thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
hello, tony.
i need you.
it wasn't sex. it was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  she died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
all the rib eyes?
...you out of your mind? that's our child. are you out of your fuckin' mind?
uh-huh.
no.
mother?
when he returns, watch him.  when he leaves again, you tell me.
it couldn't be helped. the city will have to make do with three.
don't be nervous, maggie.  let us visualize.  remember what bob said? "be the ball."
i thought you said we were going to be friends.
then look!
the scottish nobles have sent him no support. his army starves. our stall has worked, he must withdraw. you may return to your embroidery.
machine's in?
we don't serve them here and you know it. i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. he owes me money for this damage.
nothing.  just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
no.
thank you.  benjamin --
we?  there is no we in my world now, vincent, just me.
my best friend. my very best friend.
are you always sucha good judge of character?
and you?
it could happen. what about his state certification exams? the records seem to be in order.
i get it!  this is your old plan, right?
come on...
well, i'm not sure that was. christ! they better get the guy.
no way.
mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  don't make me wait another day.
wiggle your toes.
i guess.
i don't know what to do, walter.
john, they sound jamie lloyd this morning! someone tried to kill her!
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you're not you, they will kill you. don't you see? i know what you're doing, but it won't work!
and these aren't my drugs-i just sell them.
put you in touch with grimsrud.
tch. you are so sweet...now i know why you're saying this. ...you're afraid i'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
that's right.  always spying, always judging.  everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  you let diego fuck you in the ass.  maybe you are a fucking faggot.  you must be fucking diego because you're not fucking me.
i can back it up.
bob...
where'd you get this?
do people tell you look like paul newman?
oh yeah ... gorgeous.
it's gonna be close. real close.
sure you could, earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? you wouldn't want to kill anybody.
yes, sir.
right-
he won't move.
i lied.  the journey will be longer than i said.
is that a boat?
he was doing his job....
mmmm -- hurts a little.
i thought by giving away the sword, i could escape the giang hu world. but the cycle of bloodshed continues.
i...um...
wrong? why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. yes? he shakes alex's hair.
dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
well, that's all part of it.
okay, i'm just a little mad now! jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely.  we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  just below the mast.
everything's too hard.  maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own, but not now i don't.
what parcel?
how long do you have to go?
let me guess, you're the goy who stole hanukkah.
you know my friend maureen? her son, the investment banker? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton. what a mench he is. instead of schleping to save hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba. maybe then you could send me to boca, too.
i don't drink coffee.  on the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. i wouldn't say no.
october twenty-seventh.
talk has never proved that question, mr. webster!  cup for cup -- what do you say?
and the lungs are the same as ours. must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  how old do you think he is?
i... i don't know what your name is.
back home.
off the top of my head, i don't know what they could've been.
that's because i'm working.  you remember that?  you used to care about your work.
are you sure?
what?
why d'you think these seats were empty.
real 'quality-timers,' hugh.
don't you mean work me?
eleven b street, northeast. take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
i've already seen your photographs.
i understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
some kid hittin' .300 in lynchburg ...probably a bust.
oh, my gosh, everything! my trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
it wasn't her body.  it was her body of work.
he doesn't know.
what's going on?
under a hundred.
don't know that either.
yes.
michelle, she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace.
yeah.
i know all that, chief, and i don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
that's quite all right.  what is it, dear?
look at me, shinzon! do you feel the blood pumping inside you? your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. it's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
what do you get?
that's what you think.
i hope when you were on the bench, judge wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
hey - i love gloves-  i look really great in gloves.
michael, you and i are light years apart. you should go, but not with me.
bill.  come on.  the question.  the question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  the question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
no.
sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
what? be my body guard?  here's my body, theo. guard it. for my dad's sake. for your career. sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
how do you make a living?  your experiments, does it pay well?
one thing i don't need is heckling! you called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
i haven't. no.
where's that lizard?
if you don't stop, i'm going to kill you.
what will happen to him, ted?
so this sitter can always reach me.  i'm still not used to leaving him.
but you don't think that's a solution.
i don't want to learn.
you mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
so you're chicken?
your 'out.'  this came for you. 
<u>i'm</u> dressed.
don't i? ... say, that's mighty white of you, jabez.
i think you know, frank.
...would you, would you call him up. i'll give you my number, and ask him...
my friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  fire it up, doc.
they live in malaysia. in this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
and your wife? where's she?
not you. some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
you tell me what to do, i'll do it.
that's right.
clay bertrand.  he's in the warren report.  he tried to get oswald a lawyer.  was kennedy ever discussed, jack?
and you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
juarez - chihuahua city road.
kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  what i'm telling you is, i don't like surprises.
the mooring hasn't come taught.
it's nothing.  my men take great delight in routing the enemy.  don't trouble yourself, beauty.
i said, `i'm dead'. he killed me.
at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
what he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' pete...
right.
alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
that's how you met me. in passing.
what was that all about?
try the desk.
he cried.
shame on you!
what have you done with his body?
we got caught. so you know it won't happen again.
in my own way...i want you to know that...i love you.
a station wagon in canada.
just about anything, you know. it can be funny or... not. just tell me somethin'.
i am busy inside.
that's better.  how do you want us?
that's quite a moniker. i may hafta get you to write that down.
1922. why the kippers?
and i with you. but you must wake.
i will let down the steps for your honor.
as long as you keep overpaying me, i'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
hotcha character. if i had to live with your cynicism, i wouldn't want to live at all. what you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
what does she do?
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
oh that's just beautiful! all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! greenly, the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me, i will have a fucking tag on my toe! now, get me a squad car and get me over there. i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. now!
i might be able to find something on the ship. but it's gonna take time.
and even if this doesn't work, i want all the money. these swat guys don't have the temperament. they don't have the background...
he said he'd prove it.
then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, mrs spitz?
they're gone.  and there is nothing you or i can do to bring them back. but there is something you can do to help end all this.
you can admit that, can't you?
his wife's influence.
i'm taking the train...
i don't care about the money. i just want to work again.  you don't know what it means to know that you want me.
we must call the police, your excellency.
uh huh..and i don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
we've got a nice plant here.
what is hell?
i'm an irishman, sir.  an irishman is always logical.
i'm sure. just don't forget what they did to us.  we'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the federation holo-ship any more. just get the holding cells ready.
i can still use a gun.
i didn't know.  i was in a panic.  i guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. the nearest hospital was forty miles away, and zoe was continuing to swell.  klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while i dialed the hospital.  i finally got a doctor on the line.  he sounded young, but cool.  he was confident, but there was a nervousness.  he have been an intern.  this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as i was.
look where?
alright. meet me at the met.
pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
hm?
lord, you're stubborn.
you thought i was faking?
for christ's sake, john!  throw me the keys!
...my fee? wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
yeh, this time anyway.
i'm dyin'. i'm dyin'.
you can't fool an empath, captain. i know exactly when i'm needed.
be nice.
easy for you to say, sir.  fucking james ryan, i'd like to wring his fucking neck.
sid, how are they hanging?
he's dead?
that's what i'm doin'!
good day!
listening to angels?
what in the world would give me that idea?
someone help me! i'm still alive, only i'm very badly burned.
far away.
come to the rescue again i see.
not unless you can fly.
what do you mean?
i understand.  how much?
i don't care. i'm gonna drop it. i'm gonna drop it. i'm...
i know.
maybe. but i think the yellow man is on drugs. i think frank supplies him.
well, this expert dr. egelhoffer, from new york, decides to make williams re-enact the crime --
yes.
what's all this squid shit?
what?
sometimes. i told you i did.
she's all i've got.  she's the only witness.
no. i really don't.
okay. thanks a lot, linda.
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
i don't have to listen to you anymore.
sure, norville, sure...
i'll go for that.
i don't know. uh, i'm an artist, i guess. you know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
for like, twelve zillion eternities?
i doubt i'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it.
just stay in bed and rest.
you see? life can be so simple.
how you take it isn't all that interesting to me, benjamin. i'm sorry --
vernon, then. vernon hardapple. the scar's are from a -- from a horse. he fell during a race and got trampled.
charming.
an' you say no cops?
good.
sucks.  hey, bobby, turn that up.
well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
accidents. fatal. each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
i don't know how to translate that.  e difficile... il signor ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
there's the comet!
not even close.
i told him...showed him the newspaper. about sethe. read it to him. he left that very day.
you voted for him.
we playing cards tonight?
because you have hope that you'll get better?
yes!
damn straight.
it wouldn't be my first choice, no.
you know i wasn't drunk--i knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car--
yo! your spitting rice all over us! god.
oh yes, dear. i took the pills an hour ago. i should be gone by midnight.
how many kilos can we fit in these planes?
there's no other choice.
impossible! you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands! more food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
is this hy-brasil?
i don't think that bothered him.
muncie, indiana. he and my mother met as students. but i'm from brooklyn. my sisters and i were all born and bred right here.
well, you have to learn. it'll take some time. don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
his name's not future man, dignan.
not spar, i'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship.
sorry i woke you, ray.
but that could've happened to him. or to me, if i'd been alive. or you.
what?
that's not for her.  she should come to wudan and become a disciple.
i don't have a girlfriend --
oh, no.
no idea.
simply this. after the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission. if this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, colonel von scherbach.
i don’t know. could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
we're not sure yet. it's going to need some repairs.
not that well sir. i believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. did we aquire a bank from chicago or a charity ?
thank heaven.
who?
isn't that bad for it?
who did the sushi?
i can't even get out of bed yet! you're already putting me in therapy!!
donna, you are such a crack up. you don't even like mike. is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
dad ! most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
oh, it's so nice to meet you.
i don't want it. but why don't you stay and finish your drink.
i never knew my father. did you?
this your car?
you will have to ask mr de moraes that, sir.  would you like a drink while you wait?
it's like you said, every man for himself.
and isn't there a movie in the works about you?
oh you can have it, i'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
who's this?
sure, man.
that'll be a test, won't it?
in the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. according to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
buddy, it's not a question of enough. it's a zero sum game, sport. somebody wins and somebody loses. money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. like magic. that painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. i could sell it today for $600,000. the illusion has become real. and the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. capitalism at its finest.
what's that?
it's something.
i can't afford to make exceptions. once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
you had an affair with this woman, robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
i don't think that's funny.
pittsburgh.
i appreciate your concern, number one, but i've been itching to try out the argo.
it's a two-hundred dollar fine!
look over there.
i'm billy hayes... at least i used to be.
richardson is a fine student.  he's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, fettes.  come along now --
i went out in my goddamn underwear too.
your place?
i cry a lot too. i'm a big cryer.
amanda ripley-mcclaren.  married name, i guess.  age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  two years ago.  i'm sorry.
i've left marge, meredith. and mongi. so the rat's here now, in rome.
this morning was good.
if something should happen to us, the navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
what?
you want to kill him?
nothing.
read <i>mein kampf</i>? hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
it has worked -- you've given everything away -- i know where the poison is.
almost five years.
six months.
don't do that.
how could i forget about you?  you're the only person i know.
don't call me that.
yes.
but faith--
what piece? richard crookback?
he was russian.  nicholai tachlinkov.  a legend in the business when i was just starting. i admired him.  when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game.
for how long?
she's a girl of so many rare qualities.
jesus, i think her brother spotted me.
when?
how strange. and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. only three people here. you're sure?
exactly! i speak seven languages, including hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. how about you? kill somebody?
well?
i won't allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises.
mary helena.
if you can figure it out, be my guest.
and me coming in with two pair-- 
bah!  you faeries have the morals of ferrets.
why are there two deeds here?
one way to find out.
regardless of what you think, lieutenant, the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him.
crap! - i wish i had taken a photo of your face when i gave some to that detective - what's wrong ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out. so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased.  all right?
looks like...the optic nerve. i can see out!
yes.
i always figured i'd live longer without it.
they did.  make yourself comfortable.  we'll be back in an hour.
assuming your mysterious nun in right.
is it...
yes they are, aren't they?  look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
i don't have a phone.
from one professional to another, of course.
he knew my husband who died.
you're an actor, max. you should be doing shakespeare in the park.
do you like red?
i gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over chicago.
yes.
well, what about all your other friends?
they didn't take the silverware?
change?
get a coroner's estimate too.  -- miss, i've been transferred and i was disconnected. no one is answering and i need someone from security to pick up that line. it's urgent.
is it familiar? have you been here before.
we're missing two of the kids!
a hearing.
i am a nice guy, daniel.  with a job to do.  you know how it is.
i don't know.
you got something against cigarettes?
hiding?
besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
you sure looked it. something go wrong?
she borrowed your power to save her life.  when she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  in your case -- your ability to heal.  that's why she keeps her body covered.
i already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
yes -- who spoke up?
okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  here... here...
sure.
you're not a woman.
do you think i'm ready for it?! i hate this shit. i'm not a fucking martyr! i hate every goddamn part of it!
how do you do, mr. falco.  if you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  help yourself to a glass of this n.y. state champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
jess, c'mon...
occupation?
no. i want to draw.
that's no shampoo.  it'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  how old are you anyway?
you did?
he seems to be headed for topanga.
you've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. right katka?
and you were not hurt?
exact order?  then i'm next!  i was meant to die with my friends, so i'm next!
no way.
no, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
nobody told me digging was so much fun!  you pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
no. there's nothing new.
why don't we rest here? we know we can eat these.
yes... or no?  do you want the deetzes out or in?
yup.
here comes daddy.
yes, i did, just now. don't you remember?
i'll lead 'em out.
you keep the ten thousand pounds.
wait.
you got to forget you ever saw me, dil.
my husband's dead, isn't he?
my room?
what is it?  anything wrong?
ike, you could make a song outta that!
what's 'incidentals?'
shut up and deal!
when?
alonzo?  what are you talking about?  where are you...?
what the hell are you doin'?
rocky, would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship?
early, you are so sweet.
hurry -- hurry --
let me help.  i can take care of everything.
inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
it's my birthday.
i knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when i was 8.
i'm hidin' behind you.
some people do it for movement
i have no life.
maybe you're not supposed to.
sure, but the end was so sudden.
yes.
but i have never seen this before. i am not complete.
congratulations. the la guardia flight’s canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine. am i good or what?
what have you set your mind to?
only from a distance.
why what?
what you fear is the unknown. the people of your planet once believed their world was flat. columbus proved it was round. they said the sound barrier could never be broken. it was broken. they said warp speed could not be achieved. the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. it's an extension of personal fear.  captain kirk, i so much want your understanding. i want your respect. are you afraid to hear me out?
i'm going to wrap it around your throat!
i just know how you get. good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
i'll have to go to a new school -- again.
you were in love with him, weren't you?
we all know how much you like hearing that. okay, liz, i was wrong. there.  you happy?
it wouldn't be fair to her.
we're making a big investment in cuba.  that's my only concern.
<u>girl</u>...?!
i got nothin' more to say till i see a judge.
no.  you don't want his help.
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
we're americans.
go ahead.
yeah, we can have a garage sale. "hey look, i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents!"
yeah.  i understand.  just business. right.  fuck you.
you're kidding.
bullshit. you had a vision. you got sign from the old ones.
no. before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
christ, tom; i needed more time with him.  i really needed him.
she's up for it.
oh, you know how parties are. always some damage.
mr. alito, please.
yes. it's ok, lynn. these are our friends.
it's past seven.
i understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. they are willing to pay any price! they have a circulation of two million!
james mccord.
very bad now. maybe war. those greek pigs try to steal cyprus again ) how'd you lose your friends?
no bother.
i liked you better frozen.  you didn't talk so much.
i never seen a man shot before. not even in the service. must be something.
then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing eve was her understudy-
it's...the anniversary. that's what's going on...take it easy on yourself.
thank you.
yes.
apparently i'm not as cynical about earth's people as you are.
oh my gosh, bud ...
you are...
after we've worked the note we want to replace it in lecktor's cell. i don't want him to know we found it.  where's lector now?
int. postal van - day.
oh, yeah.  scared the hell out of skipper.
i tested positive?
shave our legs, stupid.
right. the mothballs, mister.
yeah, jesus--but wars would be a lot better, i think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "jesus--i'm not going to do that to the enemy.  that's too much." you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  i sent 'em to heaven instead--and i don't think there is one.
aye, sir.
i'm here.
boca?
i'm as underprivileged as they are --
did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
what kind?
talk to him, bruce.  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
you guys get those!  earl, rafe, come with me!
admiral, you'll be trapped!
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
you do?  is he a funny uncle? 'cause if he is, then he and i got somethin' in common.
nothing else?
that we could use you in and i think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
no you couldn't, sir. this is information retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians.
jerry - there's another problem.
no. no more. i'm getting sleepy.  thank you very much, mr...?
and who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. who put you up ? who gave you a job ?
oh, is that what it is?
you're on your own.  stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
yes, sir.
i told you, i've already lived my life. i don't know how or why i'm here, but you have to help me get back. i want to get back to my real life!
just hurry.
what kind, mom?
you're a great catcher.
you're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
i've regretted it ever since. never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
remember our friend healy? well, i didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. turns out there is no diabetic mom. landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
well, i did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my masters degree.
better ease up then, hawk. wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
without hope there's no point to anything.
i didn't use my name.
c'mon, mommy, don't start with that i'm an ungrateful son stuff.
-- how would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
black hair. paul michael glaser.
no. she's frightened. she doesn't know where she is.
you know, i think i left something by the lake. could you check it out-- you'll know it when you see it...
i think it's a different place for each person.
dunlevy said there was another case, ron rice. in fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. the second was george sheldon. i didn't enter it into vicap -- i'll get you the file.
yeah.
we need to find a way to make me part of it.
i... i didn't say anything...
do you know what i'm doing right now, peter?  i'm looking at the name of the girl i'm going to kill tonight.
mrs.  otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  the word doesn't mean anything to me.  as far as i'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  that's what's done, mrs. otto.  i've seen it happen so many times before.
thought you had to use some of these.
still -- those witnesses.
how did she know where it was?
well. obviously no one you have to worry about... woody.
...you should rest.
no. mcintire's. remember:  "for the very best in men's attire, head right down to mcintire's."
is he all right?
well, don't blame me. i told you.
why not?
what's the difference...
come to the office, please.
you never played a violin.
no sir, i think -- this'll be a little bit different --
maybe later.
ta.
i'm sure he's matured since then.
it's better this way. if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship. you want him on your precious earth ii?
debbie's marrying rick.
you must hate your brothers.
that's the door.
yeah, right.
got a little lucky.
just lucky, i guess.
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet.  janet.
let me guess. amy presumed i’d forget the rings.  i think i’m her least favorite person.  you know, i am sorry.
didn't think you'd make it.
they need help. jaime, anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
that was terrific.
don't be un-neighborly-like, herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
his -- real -- ?
sure, mikey.
i have good reflexes.
neither do i, baby.
illusions are trickery. magicians do it for real.
he was a big loser! what are you deaf!?
he had a gun.  he had a gun... and he made it happen.  he made me do it!  he made me put that... that thing on.  oh, christ!  he made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  he had the gun in my mouth.
did god forbid you to tell the truth?
that's so long ago, i don't remember.
who?
i get the imports.
hit your brakes.
what's the goal, joel?  my goal, joel, is to just let it flow through me? do you know what i mean? it's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we're all taught we should be consistent. y'know? you love someone -- that's it. forever. you choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. it's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. and my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. you know?
i came over to see you.  i brought something...i wanted to show you.
good-morrow, cousin.
you'll work.
have you, sergeant? author - martins. thank you, sergeant.
stay cool.
thank christ we got a witness.
am i?
oh god! what have we done?
that's not crazy. i like you too.
lubbock?
yeah, i think so.
i did no such thing!
i will hear you... but not now, not here.
that's right.  they want something...  dramatic.  i spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
and i never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing but this is serious competition.
cut it out now.  i'm warning you.
i know.
no.
here's to ed.  for making us into something.
good, just making sure.
but times were different then. i was a man at that age. the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans...
and it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and i. this evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  she's making her debut here this evening and, as far as i'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the ambassador lounge.  ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, miss susie diamond.
oh, mom's okay. they're just givin' her a ride back. she almost blew outta the back of loretta's pick-up on the way over.
you think i am in so deep i forgot?
yes.
i asked you first.
what?
no you're not.
i'm impressed. you're a killer.
what's the bad news?
right around here, in the food court.
...mrs. calvert?
sir, yes, sir!
is it safe?
how about the pig-lizard?
so where is the rest of the crew? we've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. dr. weir? any suggestions?
i'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
i never was much count at it. i never did get picked out fer it.
one more.
we'd be in all the papers!
that's a good story.
i haven't lost yet.
oh honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
i stand for honesty! i stand for some level of truth!
is he cool or angry?
are they polar bears, too?
hey, sisters.  are you going in there?
i don't care.  i see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
they don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
what about that girl?
sit down, i'll show you how we're going to do it.
all this for us?
my car! my car! tan ciera!
you mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
you didn't see the killing, or the body? how do you know there was a murder?
get behind me, dummy!  reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  wet my reel, quick!
that's none of your business.
the book said they have boats that are like taxis...  vaporettos.  what's the name of the place we're staying again?
yes sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
i worked ten years without one, i don't need one now.
you should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
not where we operate.
what did you know about your mother?
guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
look, the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them. which is what i have to appear to be doing. so i give them something they already know. you.
didn't you take it with you?
come on, where's your enthusiasm?
i'm just thinking i'm glad i broke up with everyone i ever went out with.  the swelling is gonna go down, right?
things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, jackie?
that's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
adam sandler.
but you did all you could, david. not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
nope.  there was some talk; it never panned.
my soul, woman.  i give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
workin' a saw mill.  here's to.
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther. you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, jack.
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
two so far.
gotta.
daddy, she's younger than me.
don't play simple with me, jake. you're a betting man. you want me to spell it out for you? i'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
i don't like nobody behind my back!
what about julia?
mr. jameson--
who invited you?
not yet.
as i testified.  it occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  i believe i said that.
all right, john, just take a breath, let's think about this...
what?
got a nice evening dress?
may your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
i don't, but i'm pretty sure. it's a long story but i cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  if they start a trace it will be to a pic'n'save on pico.
makes you look like a nun--
would you like to rest now, mrs. brenner.
no sense messing up the streets.
where have you been for the last seven years?
hey, one miracle at a time. they're on to me now, remember?
i don't have a boyfriend.
lady van tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  she bears so little resemblance.
yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
how about dog shit?
tonight? jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
my god!
doing what?
no.
even christ would partake socially.
you know, it's interesting. the south lost the civil war, but they still seem to get all the glory.
never saw the point of 'em.
what sort of plan?
what?!
probably tonight.
and where are you now?
yes mother.
okay.
don't be facetious darling. now drink your milk, you're late for college
rock stars!  i'm going out of my mind.  all i get are perks.  i don't make money, i make gifts. how am i supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  i want cash.  moulah.  wampum.  dead presidents.  andrew jackson. gerald ford.
that's really sweet, ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
you turned leo over on his face. but the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. it's out, and it knows.
okay.  i'm sorry, look, i meant to tell you.  it was the only chance i had to meet her.
yeah, but if i win this trip, mama'll kill me. she hates russians. i do want to go, though... to new york, especially... but i wanted to do it...
i dunno. i know a place.
this is the guy that killed my partner.
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. better to get rid of me. then he could be mr. serial killer, mr. authority on deviant behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low. do you really think that plane crashed by accident? do you really think i wasn't on it by accident? i've always had a good sense of intuition.
i wouldn't worry about money. i'll make it worth your while.
if i marry you my mother will die.
who's in it?
okay.  i love you too.
what about you?  can you stand a toss?
i need a great favor.
it's not me, it's dark here... and i can't find the switch.
who killed pike?
anything stronger?  oh, probably not. beer? you can drink beer, can't you?
first of all...
is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. i can't overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation, jean luc. a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
coulda been a contender.
the lord be with you.
are they nice?
if something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. i have skills in that respect. pinta would benefit by the fact that... i'm a soldier.
you think so?
i am king, mother!  and i do not wish to discuss this with you.
someone's been murdered.  not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  torn limb from limb.  there's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
"you have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
you expect me to just walk in there?
knows what that means.  he hears the rumble of the tanks.
i don't know. why doesn't it?
eh?
i hope not.
70 seconds! you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
what's wrong with it?
he's afraid. ever since prince humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and i don't know if they're going down -- i can't see inside his mouth anymore -- i'm up all night staring at him and i don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
i know...i know.
i'll bet!
i don't think i'll persuade you. you'll do it or you won't. dr. bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
there is -- there is no family.
he doesn't trust you.
it's been a while, sir. here we go... retrothrusters!
daniels.
nothin'... you want to go for a drive?
she looked dead. still does.
ernest, what do you think?
hide the gun.  throw it away. anything.  listen, i gotta borrow your car...i think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what i mean?
i'm saving lives here. the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
rafts. two 38s. a little ammo.
oh no!  did he get hurt?
that depends.  where are we?
oh sure.
how long?
you taking any medication?
yes.
that's right - pour it on.  talk me out of it.
look, you stay away from the mayor.  next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  you read me?
don't make me... i can't... i won't.
lucky for you. the grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
that's just exactly what he has been doing. this deal should have been closed weeks ago. tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
what was your deal with job?
i wish you were still working for me, so i could ask you to resign. how're ya fixed for cavalry?
he told me you both did....
are you relieved?
we are.  your camera.
stay away from the garden district. serious crime. i don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
do you always live like this?
yeah.
a dollar on the five, two on the nine.
montana.
i'm hardly that, mr. patel.
then i wouldn't worry too much. but let's keep an eye on her.
we're not in a tournament, gump.  ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
nebbleman.
will that help?
bastard!!!
<u>what</u>?!
new way? what's this about a new way? there's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. let me hear more.
god, fred...
okay, try me on sunday.  i'm going out to the everglades on saturday.  you guys can wash the mud off.
six seconds.
oh, she'll love it.
i think this is number three...
loves animals. loves you.
that's too far ahead to plan.
all but me! i'm a-stayin'.
nothing. i've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. you've got one haven't you?
a scratch?  your arm's off.
what have you done?
mmm.  hmm.
where superman's from? krypton?
but john hasn't got any.
about what?
is newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
blue is cold.
away put your weapon.  i mean you no harm.
the dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of b's!! they might have clobbered marge and the
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains.
it's hard to imagine.
he'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
grace, tell him.
how's this about me?
no stone may be left unturned.  it may appear harsh...
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "do you hate me!" the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
there's really no need.  this is just a scrapbook.  i should feel obliged.  thank you.
yeah!
yes, she did.
i'll be fine, hanna.  thank you.
if you can, send me a receipt.
lionheart here. i'm back. sorry about the absence. i had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
i don't think that's true.  i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny... and i'd like to know what they are.
nobody's getting in here.  you can tell them all that!
i want to see you again.
out.
figure you would have tried it already.
uh-huh.
don't call me old man.  ain't you got no respect, boy?
my problem is that i tend to clam up. i go dumb and i can't answer any questions at all. nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
you remember the man who walked into the bank of constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the bank of constantinople?
that's the god's truth.  and it gets me depressed.  i swear that it does.  at my age.  to see a goddamn: "somebody wins the cadillac this month.  p.s. two guys get fucked."
i don't call this fun, pal. you're playing god with my body.
oh, for christ's sake.
how unfortunate. so when did you finally get to see a penis?
that's exactly what zira and cornelius claim. you're talking heresy, doctor.
there's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
what do we do?
she's lying.  she lost the first one on purpose.
i guess i'm a slow learner.
well, whitey mehrholtz over at the times will. dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  that's news.
anti-nature.
oh, sorry.
are you looking for any other compensation?
oh, honey. if we had one place, we could have a nicer place and i could take care of it. we're almost never here.
if i tell you, how do i know you won't just club me and take it back?
you think it over, leon.
you know, if you could get your nose out of bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
i can't do this.
huh? no, alright. well, you know what we need? a hot cop of coffee. hand on. ohh, hey, i was up all night too, man. a long, long, long night.
got it.
i don't know what that means.
one more minute.
bodega bay. he goes up there every weekend.
it will not happen!
hey, what are you doing?!
in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection.  we gotta better ourselves."  you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>?
conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
everyone get some sleep.    we're leaving in the morning.
oh, you couldn't possibly.
love demands it.
john . . .
look, why do you care, huh?
you want me to scooch over next to you?
once a file's been sent to the caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, osborne?
you know her?
no sir...pleasure.
so i got the state lookin' for a ciera with a tag startin' dlr.  they don't got no match yet.
i want to see what they read so i'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. there's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
the majority has spoken.
it's a symbol.  of your desire to return to reality. --inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
how did you find out all that?
i see.
it's not about gas money!!  you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! not the actor -- whose name is george, by the way. his character!
words.
i ain't getting shit.
hell of a spot to put a business.
i hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
that plane goes to miami...
she's going to cook something for us?
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask.  your husband... he committed suicide?
they got that kind of money?
please, i want to wake up. leave me alone. it's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
i <u>must</u> go.
do you intend to enlist without my permission?
do you want to have some breakfast?
laura said we could.  if we helped out with the posters and stuff.  and we did.  and we are.
... an offlander?
they had a rough life. your father was a bouncer. your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. there was no place for a baby.
i don't know what you're talking about. this is the most insane... the craziest thing i ever...
i didn't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job.
i'm nauseous.  oh, jesus, now i don't get to do the tv show?
you're a dead man!  a fucking dead man!
oh!  i thought it was dr. frankenstein.
or in my chiffonier. i don't know.
is it?
it's not that simple. you have to be careful. there's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. a mob guy. wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
come on downstairs.  he won't hurt you. he needs us both.
well.  good luck with that --
it won't work.  there's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
ohhh!
do i?
since when?  usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
i don't care it you tell me or not. i got problems of my own.
yes, adulation is a cross to bear. god knows <u>i</u> know.  but someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and don't deny it, mr. cobblepot, you've got the magic!
waste of time.
what plane?  we going someplace?  where we headed?  you have your money.  it's all there.  what the fuck is going on?
i don't know that they 'pinched' it. don't even know that they're blokes.
thank you, but i hardly think --
no.
yes, i think it's brilliant. you've been doing it for years.
come straight here. don't talk to anyone.
okay, i'll make it as easy for you as i can. give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
what's going on, cynthia?
goin' out.
i'll do.
we didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
nothing.  i just prefer the other one.
i just want to make sure that you both --
you're implying th...
it's a lead mine.
that's too bad. get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. some kid i wouldn't let wash my mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. damn, i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger. he's fat, that's why, falls faster. i'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. am i shot, frank?
that... sawing and hammering.
playfully shoves his hand away.
let's go for it.  we could get lucky.
alex? where are you going?
you mean like a date?  i thought you were a fag.
knock what off?
looks like a rope.
now there's a picture i'd like you to --
the green capsules in the top drawer.
hell...
not if i have anything to say about it.
i don't fucking believe this. do you believe this?
is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
alvy singer over here!
if he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
whatever.  and i thought, please god, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  and he did. she told me the name.  granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
yeah, just stole me some from the top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  chucks are coming. you better 'didi' man.
shut up and sit down.  you think someone's gonna make a house call?
that girl was amanda krueger.  her child --
nobody's going to hurt you.
who are you?
maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
used to be. on the railroad.
goody!
jesus christ. how've you been? what's happening in your life?
i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
why?
i can't tell you.
elizabeth. if it's true, travel into germany would be banned. you'd never get near ingolstadt.  besides, they're only rumors.
no, no. you got leak.
i'm getting better all the time.
yeah.  it's not hard once you get the hang of it.  in the wrist. anyway, i did what i always do when i get one...
no.
i don't know. gretchen has a theory. that frank is a sign. i told her i thought it was ridiculous.
yes -- i do understand.
you're a big girl, huh?
shush.
no!
abdul-shabazz?
don't cut me.  come on.
she told me too, i mean, she told me she told you about sex, i personally new about sex long before i met shelly.
the "skylight?" fool!  it's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
yes.
so, did you see "seinfeld" last week? that kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
i said you're soft.
they're trying to make me spend the summer here.  i'm leaving in the morning.
mr. lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  rick, get on the jib sheet.  george, john, philip, tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  george will show you what to do.  tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. forecourse first... work upward.
not at all.
and no boys, promise me, oh those la people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and don't make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
no.
disgusting.
"what are you thinking?"...that was it. the hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. i know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, i can't lose and i can't get hurt.
then that would be eating and drinking i'd live like a prince without thinking. the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman's much better than wine! then that would be eating and drinking! the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman's much better than wine. she's much better than wine! she's much better than wine!
all winston had to do was ask around. ordell's living in long beach with a woman junkie.
me? no, i'm not good for much...
my god, you've got one?
and?
grow up, stop being such a baby.  other people get through a lot worse.
i don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
no.
good-night, folks.
none at all. i'll leave it in front of your garage. happy thanksgiving.
what you want'em for?
take a lesson from young masbath's desires, ichabod crane.  he follows with you to avenge his father's death. that i understand.  but, what do you want?
who is this.
he won't give it to me.
the town looks clear.
thanks.  i thought you'd be older. i expected a red.
the roller disco one.
that!... using ludwig van like that! he did no harm to anyone. beethoven just wrote music.
i didn't mean with you in it.
there's another one i like, i read. it's by pope alexander.
he's on to something bigger.
i have.
sure.
i'll see you at the office.  good night.
clear meadows.  that shit's dead.
you don't remember you did.  but i'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry, don't you?  you remember that.
it's engineered to last about fifteen years.
then, tell me a story.
i just fired bob alexander.
in heaven.
you've been acting so strangely since you returned. i'm—i'm worried. i haven't bothered to ask you any questions—i—  isn't all this what you wanted?  you haven't changed your mind about king, have you?
they all get the wrong idea.
find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." send it to sacramento, john .. i sniff grief ..
i have of course observed the girl in treating her.
sometimes i think-sometimes i think i should just live with a woman.
she's my best friend. i gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. i've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. she's lonely. if pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
wounded?
no!
oh dear!  but then where did the motorcyclists come from?
that isn't true...!
yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant.  it's business. there's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
you boys need help.  there are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
oh, yes.  yes, he was.
you're wrong, leia. you have that power too. in time you'll learn to use it as i have. the force is strong in my family. my father has it...i have it...and...my sister has it.
right, i guess those are the kids --
i already have, my dear.
that's my stuff from the office...
how much of this island have you explored?
put your guns on the table...  if we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in miami. we wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
everything's kosher. watch him for me.
who?
michael, the sub's dead.
detour.  other way's blocked...
please... no.
sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
certainly.
yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
because we were good at it?  hell, we were great at it. jesse, don't tell anyone i said this, because everybody knows i'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
is that absolutely necessary? it'll just make it a bigger story.
subtlety?
yeah, but they're all little wannabes. i'm looking for a professional man.
your father.  it is not <u>they</u>, who...
you all been here a long time. doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
what way?
because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot. my dear -- 
i've given up angles for awhile. i just want to solve this thing.
you are sweet.
the woman's health is at stake.
and?
he said that?
oh, jesus.  who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
any prospects?
i find myself in dire need of some cash.
running this place for a fella in town. nothing much to speak of.
well, but it was so long ago. we were so different back then...
mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come jack, we'll warm your bones.
forget it.  the vienna boys choir couldn't get through this stuff.
activating injector assembly.
it's called territoriality. it's a theory.
she'll be here in a moment. she has a special surprise for you.
and i'm daphne.
you mean you don't know?
i'm leaning toward no.
when you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
thanks for your concern larry. and fuck you too.
washington! always discussing the problems of washington. nobody ever thinks of the state--and my problems!  i *will* tell jim taylor. it's high *time* i told him a thing or two! 
sure, pop. whatever you want.
one.
what do we use for defense?
plans?
marla?
me too.  make any headway with "zorro"?
i certainly did.  i'd finish it too, but... i don't get out much.
i will...
i don't understand, who are... ?
oh, come on. what is he? fifteen?
holy jumping swordfish!
what are we talking about?
why not?
for pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia.
then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to fort edward.
we'll sell it. sell everything.
get them out of here. if he says one word, shoot him.
including killaine.
chewie, do you think you can repair him?
hey, you and i are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
now listen, if i had any information, i wouldn't have come here to ask you. but i see that you, too, lack any information ...
made what?
any ideas?
he left this morning. he couldn't say where.
seems to be all around...
i'm afraid i'm feeling a little tired, mr. lovett.
that's crazy! who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
it is not raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  it is yours.  i know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like michelle.  but do they love you?  do you love them?  what about a queen to love?  a son of your own?
what's he look like?
my wife's jewish. but that probably doesn't matter right now.
that's why smith called you macleod.
-- i wanted to be him. right then i wanted to be him more than anything...
so, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
what're you, a cop? i'm goin' out -- business.
he has been here for some time. i can feel his presence.
man, it gives me the creeps. we got no business towing a ship that size anyway. i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
don't worry about a thing, sir. just enjoy your stay.
yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.
he's dead.  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
i won't forget.
you've got to be kidding me ! his lazy ass couldn't win the special olympics.
do you want the car?
blue five, does that glare bother you?
know you? are you kiddin'? i've been looking all over town trying to find you. i saw your car piled into that tree down there, and i thought maybe . . . hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
you're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
this is nothing.  it will blow over by tomorrow.
you should hit the sack, too.
you'll be alone.
well, my parents split up when i was thirteen, and... god, i actually had to... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them.  so i chose my dad.  it just felt safer that way, you know?
so i don't shop.
you don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
this is stupid.
no.  so i was up the beach.  i saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. that's rare in this world.
and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us, i'd be an architect now.
shit.
why, you crazy toon... i've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   i come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
you are extremely sexy.
he... sam lombardo?
no, this is my first trip, doc.
oh, your case was preordained. in a way, you performed a service for the state ...  because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius.  and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. do you know what that means?
hey...lance....can i.....
i think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
who is it he reminds you of?
it's never too soon to start.
i see the truth of it. -- reverend mother  could he be the one?... maybe... but will he be ours to control?  you know when people speak the truth?
alright, alright.
that's the idea, walter.  it's the only way to gain recognition. all the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
what have you done, lsd?
the dancing dingus!
wanted to wish you luck.  not that you'll need it.
some guy called to let him know the frenchman who’d called the night before he left london was in l.a. looking to kill him. he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
d'you find the obstetric nurse?
mommy, where are you?
aw, c'mon.
you mustn't hurt him. mustn't - mustn't hurt..

charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... i mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
jean baptiste poquelin moliere.
just a minute.

i'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around, what do i need this dink airline for? i'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
yes, john.
stupid.
are you okay?
good for you, miss winch. you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
ernie, i'm a rich tourist today. how about driving me home in style?
he says he's got to stay in chicago.  he says i should visit him sometimes.
i guess the news you’d sent me after friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
even by you?
i haven't got a book down my trousers.
you bet your boots it does.
points at the motel.
right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  in the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
what for? you haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
well, i'll pay you that back sometime, mr. hillyer.
well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
i see. i've suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?
sir.
i didn't want you to know i was coming.  you heard what happened in my home?
in a minute.
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain...
rick, that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed.
well, there's lots of places where i think you can save, but i'm not the one who's ....... i mean, i'm not the one who's not the pres...
okay... they want you out. it's against the law to fire you for having aids, so they make you look like a fuck up. which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
why now, jimmy?
your pain ends now.
give him a minute, clair.
just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
no.. i've slept enough.
we can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
well, for later then.
looks to me like your out of business. now i want some answers.
it's cosmetic. they don't cover cosmetic. last year i had a tooth capped. the dentist tells me i'm not covered for caps. it's cosmetic.
by bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, i can send a long-range pulsar signal to within two feet of the rangers coordinates.
well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records?  she could at least have the decency to call me back.
i just tell it like it is, mister.  if i'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
yes, i'm...i'm looking for mr. jason bourne.
i'm working down in san diego. just for a few weeks.  thought i'd drop in on my long-lost son.
forty-three days.
they belong to the people.
when did you make this, walter?
nothing to tell.
put a fork in me harry, lets get started.
not a chance.  remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
right away, ma'am!
elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. i learned at the knee of the master.
you work that out with la senora.  you will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the malaysian ship.  for collection in north miami.  you warehouse it. release it when we say.  i'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
i called because i just want... i need to talk.
i fixed your suit.
what are you going to do?
whoa ! way to go, boy-yo !
everything's all right?  you okay?
sut mckinley.  marry me.

vampires. we thrive on blood.

general webb can burn in hell. we'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! our mission is to fight.
must be billy's girl.
yes you are.  you're playing word games.
yes, *sir*.  let's *go* henry.
there's a name on the gravestone.
i don't know!
damn.
i know where my heaven is.
you think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
it works.
okay, it's in. it's definitely in the pot!
no way to know. without more tests, experiments.
what about... those guys... i might have...
jesus.
good memory.  you must be great with numbers.
yeah. i can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
that's right! a girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
about them. you've got to leave it alone.
i got to fetch her home...
that's just lilly's way.
comrades! people of the world! the revolution is on the march... i know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  let us be happy... give us our moment....  we are happy, aren't we, leon?
you make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. man, you never leave the agency. once they got you, you're in for life.
only a very little, as soldiers do.
what if we could find bi-frost the rainbow bridge?
that's going well, then.
get out!
but he never talked.
that's all for you, sammy.
all right, get out.  both of you.
the rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. i was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
doc?  ...  doc ... hello?
hey! what's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? and we're going to have fun tonight, right?
yes, i see that.
yes, i understand. thank you.
anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
don't you know? everyone on rura penthe is here for life.
we need your help to overload the gibson so we can kill the da vinci virus and download the worm program.
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
no. we have to try. we'll figure something out. and if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. deal?  shake a paw?
we got worried. there we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
drew called from the astar, they're still two minutes away.
look at those walls up ahead!
but bob isn't real.
if it's about the posters, i think it's so awful. it's a travesty.
uh-huh.
another attack?
yeh, i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf.
it's viridiana. she's getting on my nerves.
fuckin' "a".
well, what is your definition of following?
don't be shitty.
you mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  you are in a hurry! somebody chasin' you?
much as i'd like to help you and our valued guests, i'm afraid i can't.
i think so. i tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
what are you talking about?
i didn't want to stop.
don't threaten me, private.
we ought to dare to tell each other everything, kiki -- you and i.
look at it this way, it's their contribution. if we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
yes.  i tried to talk to ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  he refuses to discuss it in any serious way. i remember one time he said i probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for billy.
no. kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
doesn't matter. i... i don't want to come back, that's all.
you remember alyssa jones? she hung out with...
people end up in occupations for a reason. they may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
sure, i'll go.
what about your father?
what's in your head, boy?
what did she do?
yes, but that's not the issue. what's on your wish list, ed? pleading kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? come on... what're you looking for here?
i know what a vig is.
me neither.
watch the booth! i'll be back! 
ethan?
it just so happens we're not in kansas anymore. our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood. she's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house. can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? it will be my greatest victory.
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
she smiles at everyone, ted.  she's like a newborn with gas.
ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
twenty, sire! how about twenty? twenty minutes of continuous music. no recitatives.
in case of a... surprise attack... at night... i am such a... light sleeper... i could wake you... i could scream.
right.
i'll take sixth.  it's faster.
no maglev system.
you're doing a murder case?
you're *ticklin' me!*
and what do you do, sir?
heavy, heavy duty. taku wakan. wanagi spirits. it's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. still don't. some of the old people say crazy horse is buried back there. we have to go ray. together. like his vision.
she did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  didn't she?!
no, it doesn't.  now, remember: you never delivered this.  you got caught in the traffic, or something.  now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
this "... of what i call god and fools can nature." who wrote that?
yes?
get back here, rool!
really.
hide it behind the gas station. then we can get the hell out of here.
oh?
what for?
how long are you planning to stay?
jesus christ!
because i took it out of your memory.
moonby. got any winstons?
yessir. she refuses them all.
a draw. what makes you think they're well mannered?
well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
take a number.  canapt 1700, tenth floor, villa vita district, olympia south.
i've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. it was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
great.  you get the girl, i get the coroner.
yes, yes--
royalty do not help people with their luggage.
you pronounce it incorrectly. ni- notchka.
at least help raoul.
what's a prom?
no.
the television said they've started with the looting already. vultures.
he sees betrayal everywhere. he will attack us so long as he is conscious.
well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  how are your eyes?
what did you tell him?
i still like upstart the best.
i ain't blind, you asshole.
she's with me.
yes, my love?
but what if the play was a hit?
hey.
life is good.
yes, well, from the department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
it's a good idea for a newspaper.  four hundred sixy thousand.
no.
sure i'm sure!
of course.  is it, am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
yes?
any bit in particular?
yeah, but no presents till midnight.
pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! take the van and go.
sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
it's eating a hole in the floor!
well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.
aren't you the lucky one...
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country. he was afraid with no one home i'd— get into bad company.
are these.
you bet we are. and i can't talk to you now.
can --?
it's up.  love gives you wings. you can fly away from here.
'cause you're kind. it's in your nature.
do i?  i'm a little confused.
rosalie testa!
this will be very dangerous... are you quite sure?
'we?'
good, because we got a fine old american custom we want to teach you. you know what these are?
tell me, michael.  what really happened with pentangeli?
listen, toby, i can't really talk right now. do you mind if i call you back?
you do shorthand and typing?
i'm going to tell the truth.
what's gotten into you, babe? i remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let cobb get away with a thing like this.
thank you.
that must be nice. that must be really, really, really great.
i know, kid.  i know.  me too.
not from you.
the mean old man with the claws.
no, they're living in nice now.
i've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
i had lunch with joanna. she said she told you about peter. you weren't concerned, she said.
he's in the l.b.j. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
what else should i become?  there's no difference between virginia and england.  i must be educated if i'm to take my place in society.  my father couldn't afford to send me to england for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  everyone laughs at me.
knox!  what are you doing here?
where the hell is she?
you'll do more.than that.
not that i'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
no, no ... i did that...
i lost my wallet.
oh no.
what? she asked about my father?
they don't know. they were having some recreation deal out at knott's berry farm and kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
the beach.
okay. you want me to pick you up?
i'm sorry, i'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  do you mind?
have they harmed you?
i told you.  you need to rest.
gee.  you really think?
what did he say, katrina?
she's remaining in her room. she isn't feeling very well.  now please go on without me. i eat very little.
...we’re turning in circles.
go ahead then.  i'm covering the receiver.  she can't hear.
so i guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
it's okay, you got a lot of protection.
you would, huh? if i was you, baby - i wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
not that often.  he was excited to see you.
oh my god.
okay... well, i'll see ya then.
shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
stop bullying me. everybody's bullying me.
she's coming over here...
if you don't calm the hell down i'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
they used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
no. no. i can't. if ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
it would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  why the loyalty, wendell?
she's got him! you hear that?
what if we get separated?  way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share.
yes.  yes, i'm fine...  we need more brushwood!  why are you staring at me like that?
shit, we're seniors, ram. too old for that crap. let's give him a scare though.
easy, there, mom.  easy.  this is audio only.  john coltrane.  "a love supreme." give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
she was only-
and that's where you met oswald for the first time?
i'm sorry, i can't do that.  i don't have the time.  goodbye
you thought it was just.
it's private property. plus i have hector.
i can get them -- but what do i get if i do?
fucking drunk, huh?
are you sure?
yeah, right. you can't get enough of me.
they really have to work on that street name thing.
okay!
not a chance!
so noted.
he needed my help.
huh?  you're implying i'm some kinda psycho criminal?
you broke my nose!
he ain't the only one.
i didn't ask him to come!  it's like i said, thelma, he just loves the chase.
...so he's dictating you a new bestseller?  whatever that is, it's not our son.
i am, master shakespeare.
ask, you're the girl reporter.
there is very definitely a difference, miss.
you don't know?
i don't know who i am! i still don't know!
that's important.
everyone is gone. rhonda is in the bathroom.
of course not, david. i'll fetch in young miss price.
i won't be back. i've requested the atlanta run.
mornin'...
and the vow of chastity.
why?
theories?
you mean for you.  a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. and you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  this isn't going to work out.
hey, mr. arky, gimme a break!  i'm seventeen years old! i'm not responsible for all these problems!
thank you, sir, most kind ...
how do i know?  i got the call from alonzo on an open line.  that is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock friday night.  okay?  i am trying to alert you, here.  <u>you</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  i do not.  but we know this guy.  i think you know this guy.  normally, he is cool.  tonight he is distraught. that is atypical.  that engenders foreboding.  do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? as in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
i ain't got no money to get 'em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
because they're vampire wanna-bes. if they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
jimmy!
at the moment, very little.  your company at my table...
that's my morning's pay.
maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room.
i mean i'm a wheelchair girl now. it's hard to pretend i'm a beautiful rock star.  not like you used to tell me.  remember, daddy?  all the people that were going to discover me?  where are they now?
handstitched italian. filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the caddy.
sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
please!... that's not like you.
you're the one who brought it up. this morning.  in your car.
there has to be.
that's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
he can handle it.
what kind of doubts?
are you the one who left that note?
certainly understandable.
so, it's a big country with a free press. you can go work somewhere else.
i'll come inside with you, if you like, but mr. crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
i'll tell you, then. the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself. listen to it.  they listen. did they pick little k's recording? did they pick some other conductor? no, they picked you, and why? because you represented them so beautifully. when the devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. you were everything to them.
i'll be back when i can.
she will, mr.  laloosh, she will ...
eleven-hundred.  that's my lowest offer.
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "unique." that's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
oh, quit your whining and pay up.
daniel!
but rose...
addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
serves me right for not being musical.
i want to see pilgrim.
i want him to think that.
oh honey, i wouldn't miss this for the world.
thanks...partner.
we got a boat.
dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  he was at the scene.  he grabbed the cash.  of course.  this is perfect!
uh ... we'll let you know.
why shouldn't i be jealous?
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria?
i'm going to send them to my friends for christmas presents.
but you're perfect for it. you're young, you're single, you're successful...
it's me. it's jake. listen... it's happening. gordo's landing right now. meet me at the euclid... for your cut, i mean. it's... i want you to have it.
it's what the maids are for.
hm...
want me to get that?
i don't know.  i hadn't thought much about it.
<u>i don't know why</u>!
they wouldn't?
what if--
soon, captain... quite soon.  
can you stop that slaughter?!  can you free these men?
three.
you came up here looking for the portal?
i told you to send it back.
you're gonna shoot me!
it's a tampon in a teacup...
sounds good.
what do you mean?
thank you. but i think i’ll go to bed. it’s been a long day.
why were you buying a coffin?
it may well be. i know how you won that election selena. you can't fool me.
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
you're not going to abuse them. they're all so sweet.
so if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  with that last one.  would those cleats have lined up?
good, let's drink up.
well rest easy, i'm not angry with either of you.
flares?
nothing scary there.  sorry.
grazie, a lei, signor antonio!
thank you, sergeant major.
me too.  that's why i like it.  it's been a long time since i had a case i cared about.
wait.  you not adele?
okay, i will.
yes.
i'm sorry.  look, i'm not real comfortable being here, but...
talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and i would never do anything to...
general ripper, can i ask another question?
every time we have dealings with starfleet, i get nervous.  we're dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon. remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? that's exactly the --
perhaps you and i could get together at some point also. –i'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. i just... i don't know anyone here in this town.
can we do it at my office?

be careful!
and then...
she didn't like me... i made a fool of myself...
sure.
you're skill.
hey fuck you.
i'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, miss walker, you have nothing to worry about.
must be nice. so, what's he like, is he like john?
i did not know, so when i heard you were coming, i asked him that myself.
hobby! what can she do? she cooks and she cleans. you gotta have a house to clean. you gotta have children to cook for. these are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
i have to.
what -- like scobie?
no, i'm holding for tony. in chairs. keith fisher. okay.
no, i just told you what happened.
i'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--lay off sally marsh.  --"honest jack"! one look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
a pizza?!
okay, so the guy's gonna look like meatloaf's backside.  no-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
i just wish you coulda seen the movie.
got there!
why?
hello. my name is beatrice. have you been here before?
no. you'll want to ask a lot of questions i don't want to answer right now. i already have a ride.
where you gonna be during all this?
but remember, darling -- i don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
i fail to see --
much to your disappointment, no doubt.
i'm tommy.  tommy doyle.  laurie strode -- jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
just a second. guy's going for $2500.
i couldn't help it! it was the most fun i've had since i've been in law school. not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him. he has to see serious i am now. even donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
why are you telling him that.  are you crazy?
i'm sure they do - ha ha! but i can't read their serial numbers here. so if you could read me -
i'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
in my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
no thanks!
i'm here.
what can i do for you?
we're low on salt.  i should go to pembroke and get some.
i feel pretty.
excuse me?
i thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
wow, you can't buy this kind of publicity!
no more.
kristina's fine.
where? where is he?
no. it's ridiculous. this has nothing to do with tom grunemann.
don't talk to me like that.
you got your riot gun?
any time.
yeah.
all their lines were busy.
this is my business. mr. dickson's been like a father to me.  what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
the least i could do for you, deanna.  besides, you know me... i’m a talking head.
because i guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. girls like mary don't stay single.
yeah.
i'll work on it...
yes.
what you talking?
yes?
i'm here, dad.  i'm here.
it seems almost inconceivable that i haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. so eve is not working for max after all-  - max you sly puss.
mr. chairman, there is an old saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
i'll make the soap myself.

it's been a long time, ma.
there's no child here.
i am quaid.
what about you?
what are you so worked up about jack? fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
that wasn't payment. when you first came into breakfast, when i saw you -- i thought you were handsome... then, of course, you spoke... so now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. tell me, why did you bring me?
once.
naw, that's some stupid shit.  now you know how i got that name.
i feel like they do.

but you hated four out of the five you did.
check your driver's license.

hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down.
i work in the palace, i don't get out much.
jack wade. citibank. commercial loan division. if you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
you didn't tell him your name, did ya?
qualen, go fuck yourself.  the game's over--you lost.
actually...  that's what i been askin' myself.
now hold on. there's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
larry, i'm so scared, would you please hold me.
very slick.
looking around... i've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
you told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
you know, i'd take you up on that in a minute.  i'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
what are you doing in the ship?  beth?
now, really -
i tried it once.  i lost my shirt.
what's the matter with your leg?
don't call me "mack," honey.
according to the njac-the new jersey administrative code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
it should all in the report. i told you guys everything. she was giving birth in the fucking car. she grabbed the wheel and i lost control.
which way is house 25?
what! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? not so you could notice it! now, look, i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
what happens if you level with her?
would make me feel better about it.
i just couldn't stand seeing him again.
i've got my seahaven bankcard.
yes, baron.
gee, um...  i...i don't know what to say.
that's too bad.
it is for that he hates me.
i never thought i'd get out this way.  i'll tell you.
oh-h-h... was she hurt?
aw, come on jerry. we've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
come over after i'm done here?
i think that'll be fine.
it's just a thought.
may i come in?
i discussed it very openly. i told her that i had spoken to lloyd - and that he was interested.
does this conversation have a purpose?
he say we like the same thing as married.
because there's nothing to see.
listen, frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
and i have no desire to hurt you. you will always be beautiful. think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
no kidding.  i'm on the corner of 65th and cpw.  come get me.
i like your bar.
thank you...
what's the matter with this kid?
goodnight, mr. carpenter.
i signed the permit.  i don't know how i can.
what do you want?
examination! m'sieu laval, what are you insinuating? i have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. how long have you enjoyed madame's confidence? three weeks, i believe.
don't give me that.  kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
i understand.  sir.
i'm fine, fine.
i guess.
do you like the way i feel?
ok, you can turn around!
i'll pump the gas. go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
i'll eat when i'm good and ready.
why? come on, julie. think. you'll get it. will benson -- ben's son.
peg leg?
that's daddy!
congratulations.
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
don't speed, chase.  it's not...
your friends use the pool too.
oh! somebody was peeking!
it's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
take it, damn it.
let me see the tracking alignment display.
what's that?
reed. even you can't compute every little thing.
sure hudson.  are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo?
do you want me to carry your pack for you?
keep these. we're going too.
we make it, or we go back empty handed.
landon carter. i was driving the car that --
some crank.  looking for goat hooves.  come up with anything?
and that was the last time you saw him?
yes ma'am, i do.
on the cervix transfer, you almost lost the t297.
i did.  that stuff i gave him was counterfeit.  they'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
learning language.
it was quite a page turner.
there's a great deal i have to show you, i'm not even sure where to start  there's so little time.
it's private.
i don’t know.
what is it with this?  they wouldn't spend less time with peter if they lived here!  he has no time!
because i want to know.
something - i don't know.  i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open?
divorce?  never!
a no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. has that never occurred to you?
len, can i see you a minute?
packed.
let's go. i'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
oh yeah, i figured that. how much?
why waste time -- it's getting late.
i don't know.  that's strange.
so does your tongue cramp up?
you're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
that was three years ago after that first party!
miles is different. he's still so idealistic.
going nearer to god!
that means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
okay.
195 pounds.
yes, this is doctor bean.
you mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
i did what i could for you...
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  he makes us quit the life at thirty.  he doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
maybe the voice isn't diane selwyn. maybe that's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are.
foreplay. foreplay.
sure, i must drop in on the mad wench. her wounds need soothing.
i miss you, jimmy.
"next?"
who's up for making some real money?
i'm telling you he won't know the difference.
sin city. devil's playground. the black bitch. all day every day.  where's tina?
see, frank's being smart about this.
<u>kelly</u>--
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
good luck.
i remember words i said to jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
...we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
hey, what am i-your son? whatta you mean? i-i came over to --
yeah, i can see that. later i want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.

that's right, you have the right to remain silent.
what the hell you talking about?
just keep goin'...
didn't you know this is my home town?
what?
howdy, rhonda.
no.
i have, i don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
stop! you stop right here. i don't want to know anymore. i told you not to do this bachelor party thing. you were warned.
so swann was performing magic. not illusions?  and what?  you thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
you may step down.
the box? like in your story? like in his house?
hmm.
years ago, if memory serves. when does the exhibit end?
charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
we can't. all we can do is guard against our own corruption.
men never get this movie.
where?
my man!
god protect you, honeythorn gump.
i am jenny haydn.
it's the best seat in the house. i warmed it up for you.
he's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
everybody keeps starin' at me.
what's your twenty and what's your handle?
i've got friends.
we got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  materials which disappeared from dr. lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
so i guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
your type will soon be extinct.
stick with me, kid.  looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
a heavy christmas present.
thanks for the coffee.
baby, you treat me so good. peerless, you're a good son, i love you.  you never gave me no trouble.
calm down brent.
my compliments to you, miss stella. this is what i call a saloon.
i don't know about that. and then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
why, lois, i didn't know . . . who is he?
that's because you can hardly see through those things.
that's pretty close. he's going to be on the bill. why not put barbara jean on with him?
'who's afraid of the big bad wolf, the big bad wolf...'
you think he killed anybody in korea?
how do you know?
what's that?
oh my god, you kidding, me marry burke dennings don't be silly, of course not.
she used some stupid code name.
laz... you can't say nothin'...
yeah. i had the feeling that i got you at a bad moment. you know, i heard high-pitched squealing.
do you want me to sleep on it?
fiddlesticks! she don't hear it. got better music to listen to than that.  there -- that's what i mean.
you keep going to the shack. i'll meet you there in an hour.
i need to get to amarillo immediately.

my mother spoke to my uncle victor. he's in the army and he fixed it up.
i have it here.
where the hell are you?
sure.
yes.
it is something i have done -- or did not do.
listen, terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
nothing...that's mcgown...that's singer, isn't it? goose turn around, pay attention. what are you doing?
i sure as hell hope so.  let's go.
do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
i'm pulling the green wire.
presence - with a double ass meaning gifts i bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause i throw what i know with a resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
...her unbridled sexuality.  that he...
i felt you...looking through me...
it's locked.
come on. let's go.
go ahead, kat. hate me. you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing. maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
yeah.  what's that?
did you remove anything in the cellar!
cute, evan.
there's always a surprise.
yes, shit. oops, sorry!  sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
now you.
where's craig?
what's the difference?
yeah, but we got a little bit done. and if you do a little and i do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
now, judy, it isn't anything to get --
what she's going to do is get in my way.
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
is he all right?
a long time.
yes, sir, church of england, sir.
yeah.
well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
all right, all right.  jesse james never yelled at folk...
i got 'em, all right?
it shouldn't be any harder than general motors was. but now...this is what i get for using humans.
that's not the way it's done.
let's split up. you take the left side, i'll take the right. we'll meet in front of the cineplex.
not yet.
no, but i liked your book on nuclear weapons.  we have similar views on the balance of power ...
in view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
you said, first, he was lying.  how do you know that, doctor?
all last night he could have been--
i don't know, dad doesn't either.
it wasn't me; you have my word.
... that's all right.
sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
believe me. the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyle's. and if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
there is <u>one</u> thing i'd like you to tell me.
is that what you think of me? i believe in the grail, not the swastika.
oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. i don't like it.  maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
who?
the party's over.
the machine will bring his temperature down.  his vital functions are strong.
what? for chrissakes, spit it out.
he's just afraid to show it. aren't you, little brother?
this all has something to do with superman, doesn't it?
oh, i think we're going to have several.
is there one in these waters?
no good. he needs guarantees. he says... his life is in danger... he has seen the devil... looked him in the eye.
i never said he was an altar boy, okay? but he sent his goons after me!  they tried to kill me!  i'm not kidding!
oh boy.
did you get it, too?
the patient was in great distress. naturally he was...yelling.
alice?
it's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
i can see that.
and i feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean i need to get involved.
numbers? no, never mind.
take your time.
why sir?
everything... everything's so funny...
um... yeah.  now he's going to need a respirator. do you have one?
oh my god. i can't tell you how nervous i've been. i couldn't sleep last night.
where?
please stop now.
yes.
oh, lotte...
give me money or i'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
how much of a hurry are you in?
that used to be true, vince.  i was with you.  but something happened.  and i'm different now.  real--different.  i've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  and i've got just two words for you.  and those two words are...
i will see you at suppertime, rose.
i don't know. you're not supposed to see them. they're supposed to see you.
excuse me, missus. no time for the old in-out, i've just come to read the meter. slide of bird's nest with eggs.
i can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  ever. i'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
you have a responsibility to tell me.
no, that's the only thing i would've looked for. and it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
don't guess. just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you i'm heading east.
look, you could come up.  or you could wait if you want.  i could go check it out.  you could wait.
only at the very end.
attack?  but -- i hate attacking! it's so hostile!
oh, of course. who can forget the emmy?  then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens.
what?
hi, is vada home?
then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the party, who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait?
i'm wise to your tricks, lady.
spit it out, captain.
okay, you're under arrest!  now you happy?
but i like being human now.
i can't take any more school.
okay, doc.
don't lose sight of him. this is the most important thing in my life.
and is foley a part of this?
oh, yes, yes.
okay.
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society, and they got her.
you're a liar!
let me have a look.
honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
nah, it's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing.  it didn't hurt at all.  it was just a yoga move.  i tucked my head in.
wait a minute, martini, i can't hear a thing.  what?
didn't mean to pry. i just have this theory. some of us who got to good at this? we were -- escaping something.
where are you?
in the private aircraft hangar. anybody could have walked in.
home sweet home!
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
no, i did not.
if any form of pleasure is exhibited report to me and it will be prohibited.  i'll put my foot down; so shall it be - this is the land of the free.  the last man nearly ruined this place he didn't know what to do with it.  if you think this country's bad off now just wait 'till i get through with it.  the treasury is low on dough; the last man went and flew with it.  if you think we're short of money now just wait 'till i get through with it.  the country's taxes must be fixed - and i know what to do with it, if you think you're paying too much now, just wait 'till i get through with it. 
no.  you're trying to beat me.
i know.
oh-n-no -- i --
reilly! he's loaded!
i dunno .. i guess this is staff side of the building?
or twenty-four as it is in earth time. furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  ah, this earth...this world you live in, kal-el...  resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
good night.
me?  i say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
a bad mother. by any standards. i've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.
scagnetti? oh shit, i hear he's a motherfucker.
i'm looking for you.  i need your tactical unit.

intriguing. i wish i had more time to discuss this matter.
the shit they pull, huh?
the workers don't get on?
he said he has to find a perfect dozen.
what'd you find?
that's it.
whatta ya mean, boss?
bunch of savages in this town.
drop the bogus forgery charge and i'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
so where are they? starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
i like it here...
they ran his name and got a hit. he's been in before.
i ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.

they can survive winter.  as long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am i foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
i adjusted it.
that's right.  it's a crime.  it is a crime.  it's also very safe.
so let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
no one else knows
no shooting.
do you ever masturbate?
save me the grief.  step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
i could have you deported, you know that?
and...your point?
perfect...
have you ever done this before?
and, anyway, you sell yourself short. i can tell. there's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. i can tell. my goal... can i tell you my goal?
you're in kinship?
ever again.
this might do ... i don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  we're trying to keep our costs down.  you know how it is when you're starting a new company.
i guess it's not that obvious, then.
take some matches, see?  and a cigarette, see?  tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
two or three days! while lyssa is in their hands?
can anything be done for him?
i may be a shut-in, but i do not lack for news. i'm sorry you had to go through all that.
got here just in time. go ahead. jump in line. maybe you'll win a prize.
no, not here in pennsylvania, she went to russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.

nineteen fifty --
i'll be dipped in shit.  i will, too.

thanks. so do you.
no.
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you.
say what you gotta say. don't be a smart ass.
oh... are you... ?
what's her address?  where does she live?
what does this mean?  now we got the fbi, my team is expendable? i'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  why ruben, anyway?  he and nikko don't even get on together...
there's no one in there. stay out of my motherfuckin bedroom.
then, you should call.
what?
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. you know that france has recognized the soviet.
they're coming.
mmmm, possibly. yes. but public opinion has a way of changing and you, alex, if i may call you, alex?
you're going to stay, aren't you?
you're going to bet my money on a dog?
maybe another drink first. more tequila?
yes, norma.
if you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
yeah, i know--man made me memorize the whole damn army chain of command before he'd marry me. so this is a big deal, commander and  all?
uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
can we talk?
how's bugsy doin'?
steve?
it's great to hear from you.
who?
relax, i got him.
now, i don't know amy --
hi, louis.
well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp, or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy, have no fear, roman is here. aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet.
i'm sorry, baby.  this thing is just kicking my ass.  i thought we had it with this one...
i know it's warm...  i wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, ken.
what's wrong?  tell me.
oh?
i'm fine. kind of tired.
i don't know. that's why i came to see mrs. redi. i'm trying to find her.
no kidding!  no fucking kidding!
but you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, i know you have.
when will i see you again?
andy, they don't think you suck. they've just... lost a reason to love you.
why am i what?  excuse me?  i catch you saying the f-word again.  i'll kill you.  that's a fucking promise.  now get the fuck out of here.
right beside you.  i borrowed viktor's car.
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
the new belle and sebastian.  like it?
yahoo!
edgar, think twice.  he works in the kitchen.
well? why aren't you there right now?
i'm worried about him, he's worried about me, i ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like i'm not supposed to know he's there.  now it's christmas, and you know what happens to people at christmas.
i don't think so.
i promise.
apartment's okay.
frankly, i don't remember.
i know we're prepared. i just don't know if... i'm ready.
absolutely not. in fact, i picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
you musta seen him get shot. i know you did.
you understood them.  that's what was amazing.  it's a nice day.  let's eat outside.
hot?  hey, they're not even room temperature.
... i see.
from the belltower the day she before she died.
... want 'em to go apeshit.  nutso. ballistic ... do permanent damage to little old ladies.  loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>sounds</u> fun.  but i ...
yeah, so what do we say?
my name is sam. samuel.
not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
why don't you speak to her, ramona? women are good at that sort of thing. think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  you are kind, ramona! speak to her. i know i don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, i'll not forget you or your little girl.
is that what she used to sing?
i can explain if you'll just listen. will you listen?
oh, good.
you're betrayed shiva. 
then, go get her
you're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
what good stuff?
i'll answer anything.
the pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- i hate them!
you think it's funny, motherfucker?
he said he knew karate!
first, you desert me, and now you mock me. go back to your one-eyed friend.
but -- how can you just live for what you want? what about other people?
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all i did here was follow orders. it didn't add up. plus, i got kicked out.
am i a doctor, no, but...
maybe it was just a dream. ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
sounds big.  what's he do?
don't fuck with me, man. you look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  i'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  this expedition is over.
so?
you think i'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
<u>no</u>.  if you don't kill him instantly, i'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  and even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
and even if we haven't seen it yet, i'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
what does it mean... climb down to the horseman's soulless place?
the technical term for you is "chimera"...
you're as bad as harry...
like how?
i think it's more complicated than that. besides, he's a little... scattered. he almost... did something stupid tonight. at least, i think so. anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff.
some americans?
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
and what does that mean?  are you insane?!  you think i would hurt lois?! she's the mother of those kids! what is wrong with you?
it was owed to me.  you stole the damn...
look at her! she'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
i need to go.
so whattya say, kid?  you in or out?
the sphere looks different.
i wouldn't know.
he doesn't have to! it's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
and are you afraid?
why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
oh, george!
well, a hat...
how do you know?
i thought we were meeting here.
the biggest. the biggest movie you've ever dealt with, lee. we're talkin' a lot of film. a man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. and lee, you're no idiot.
maybe a few times i have.
year ago, i come in here on credit card fraud, but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my dunn & broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
what difference does it make to find an explanation? that's the way it went. but alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. and that would have been a pity! because they're wonderful, i've seen them all.  but you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. you should have kept your own.
and when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
blow me.
bingo!
betty would never dress like that. she's not some trailer park slut!
who is it this time--my mother?
oh! hello, amy -- was it -- i thought she said, mamie --
maybe you should ask her some time. ever thought of that?
well, i can't, sweetheart.
yeah.  thanks.
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
nothing worse than a common tool.
i'm on my way to get a haircut.
yes.  it was, actually.
now i was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
what kind of junior p.i. would i be if i didn't go with you?
no. in fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
no.
oh, no, sir. no different than—
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
who the fuck are you? dr. joyce brothers?
no thanks.
don't move!
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor. but it does make all the difference to agnes.
<u>lure</u> him. 
it's okay.  look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
whoops.
it means you'd better get some rest. we'll be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning.  the trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major.  now go on!
they're truck drivers.
what happened to boxing? i thought we made a vow.
the shark's mouth.
what?
that guy who got shot--
all right, walter.
huh?
yes.
wrong again--  but i dislike possessive women.
skip and i wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. that's a big deal.
you--uh--you better relax, senator. you'll be plumb wore out.
what else?
and god who allowed you to be caught?
jesus christ!  listen to yourself! i can't do it, grace.  i can't do it.
why did you break up with me for marco?
actually, yes.  it's by no means bad, i...
pretty strange.
why?
yes, i remember you mentioning it. i got mine about the same time.
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself. otello's is on delle croce, just off the corso.
weaver, they're career girls. they're obsessed with digging.  no, i'll probably never meet the girl for me.
what?
not well.
that's debatable.
i don't know how else to look--
i – mr. lipnik –
four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the green dragoons under tarleton.
i -- oh --
you said speak czech!
we need milk....
what's the plan?
why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  do you enjoy it?  all that blood and noise and pain? diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
will you speak the fucking english language? the poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  the boy speaks english, you know. reads, writes, i swear it. he does this when he's around girls. thinks it's cute.
anyone?
stu - stop it. that monkey is <u>good luck</u>. you thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. so relax! enjoy it!
i know, i am so sorry for so many things. i love you, moira. i love you. i love you.
i know, i know, should'a called. i've been really busy. i joined the fire department.
you. mouth closed.
no, not much.
hey, i got a mother.  jackson, you got a mother?
false alarm.
what?  now i'm working the drop car? who's handling the scene here?
i'm moved beyond words.
hiya yourself.
alright.  may i have your phone number, area code first?
what's our weapons situation?
yeah, well max offers a lot of things. and i got news for you. he's not the sweet old man you think he is.
it is my oil!  mine and my family’s!
you once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  that sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  do you remember?
i'm afraid she is, baby.
nope.
you not ugly.
franz, don't you see, hitler was a man of his time.  this is a man of his time.
if beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe beynon's boys will be waiting for us in el paso.
why was the floor wet?
hey, i got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
in the new library there.
paris.  i live in paris...
pull over.
well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. the beatnicks were before my time, and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
i guess it was 1984, 85.
remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? more beautiful than any church i was ever in.
christ.  i didn't lock the fucking drawer!  you spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  you can't imagine how many times i saw you two... your head together, i wish him dead.  every time... want to hear something weird?  i feel like i'd give my life to bring him back.
i could come up with 750 grand in a day if i had a reason to.
i'll tell you what:  i should go in there, volunteer to fill up his female quota. 
wait!  i hear her breathing now. there, she just picked it up again.
don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
take the test again.
you break your leg, i'll have to shoot you.
professional killer. do you get dental with that?
who's this?
hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. thought we'd swing wide. okay by you?
mary beth! this has never been anything but --
well i'm on my lunch hour. i'll wait.
devil worshippers!
i know... i still can't get over that his name was "seymour."
they've got quaid!  they're protecting him!
oh yeah?--my personality put this thing over--
well, i... didn't bother to read the article. i didn't think the picture did you justice.
no.  nothing.
my brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
.
it's like a joke. you remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. the only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
i admire your valor, jack.  by all means, seek him out... but first, we needs visit the kitchen.
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night? nighttime is my time.
hell, it won't be us!
captain, we're receiving transmission from paradise city. they're demanding to know our intentions.
wheels?
talk away, lady of my dreams. i'm all ears.
i don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
you heard kelly say "sam."  that was lombardo on the phone.  and you saw the girls...
wanna go to dinner?
so? be real easy.
i know i am. why, i even heard a shot up there last night.
oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
it's the right thing to do.
nicky, i'm sorry.
did you get my note?
if you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
whah you say? dissdee?
forgive?!
yes, yes, i know that. everybody does. lord leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. i can't lose him.
it's not my alibi to tell --
i'll get home all right now.
she wasn't the last one to see them alive. whoever killed them was.
toto, come here.
there isn't one.
wait a minute. what are you talking about?
lookin' at?
tell him i was looking for him, okay?  i'm dan.
ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  a man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what ah mean, ma'am...
the problem is, willy, that charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as i say and keep the fucking cage locked.
well how can i repay you?
the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  if you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  we needed to know what you believed.
he don't sound like he's from 'round here.
believe me, i'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. but it's not in the cards, partner.
have you never wondered -- and i mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
captain, the enterprise!
going out with meurice.
okay.
you bet!  they'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
what about newspapers and magazines?
no, thank god he has not.
who?
are you going to fire me, bill?
yes, owen?
what are you going to do?
well, i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person.
we're only joking.....it is your round though!
well, i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka.
we'll just say it was in bad taste.
harmful, like -- how?  what would you get?
hey, it's cool. hallie's into it, i'm into hallie...
i was her doctor.
yeah, that's pretty much it.
) what do you think?
immediately. you'll be working with ms. kensington.
i'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
we're half-brothers.  paul is mother's first child.  when his father died, she married my father. dr. rand, the missionary.  and you know what they say about missionaries' children.
just a second, mike ---  mollie, i got it!
we are to blame.
i said shut up!  now who sent you?
i'll tell you something, doc. one day you're going to have to trust somebody...
...why?
all we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
joey, relax. you're taking this the wrong way. why don't you sit down and have a drink?
why was i not informed of this?
a pneumoencephelogram, i would think, pin down that lesion. it will involve another spinal.
can i just ask for one thing?
so i'm gonna act!  ever since i can remember i've wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
that's mars.  the closest planet to us, now.  that's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
i was so excited about meeting you. again and again, i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you.
it's always john.
i know.  i taped it.
what?
we're not supposed to think about it.  but i dream about it sometimes...
so what?
play it tough.  that's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  don't lie to helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  say the president believes it's going to open up the whole bay of pigs thing again.  tell helms he should call the fbi, call pat gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
i'm a full-blood oglala.
i'm sorry, sir.  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso. this is the new hotel paraiso.
shut up.
better get that story in, hank, it's getting late.
well... it's the only one i have. it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
what's wrong?
excuse me.
may i continue with the rearing of my son?  load that gun!
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
you can't run with suitcases.
continue on course. chekov, any signs of federation escort?
man, el-rage is el-rage. you know him.
thanks, quince.
that's the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take.
what's the matter? don't smell so good, huh? must'a broken some records.
sure.
might even incinerate the damn thing.
this is a whole different ball game, erin. a much bigger deal.
how do you mean?
well, we need that ring.
but we mustn't underestimate american blundering. i was with them when they "blundered" into berlin in 1918.
i've got to go see gruber.    what's the best cigars you have?
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
no. myers is taking me.
that's bullshit.
anyone else following?
i'm not nick!  you thought you'd fuck him over?! well he's fucked you! i've never worked at some casino! i can't help you! because he's not me!
that makes a change.
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
no.  no, i don't.
ah, craig. just the fellow i wanted to see.  juicer! easy as pie. just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
so what about "michael" then... mr. brooks brothers... mr. bmw.  you still seeing him?
so it's to be torture.
that's very tempting, but it's impossible, i'm afraid. wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. you see, they're all originals.
i don't know... i think it was something else... suzie says the bust was bullshit...
thanks.
you know a guy named merle?
really?  and what game did you want to play?  you carry my box for me, and i fall into bed with you?
great. fine. perfect.
i think i've got it. once i get going, i'll be okay. but... how do i get started? i mean, i hardly know her.
i said give me time.
don't be such a pussy.
you don't like her. you only met her for two minutes.
the boy is happy, fred.  don't be such a killjoy.
no, sir!
look, i'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, i got to tell them the truth. we-- don't--need--a new jail.
what are they?
it is too! now you passed it!
they'll do nicely.
on my way.  alright sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
he didn't?
that's different.
do me a favor, will you?
got it.
oh, yeah? what did he do?
and what have you come up with?
i despise it.
you have to get out of here.  if tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  he's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  he's such a control freak, he's even paying max to follow me around.

look, it was a screw-up, alright? they weren't supposed to find anything.  we thought that camp was empty.
no.
they're waiting for him to walk in.
casper! was up kid?
what do you mean...yale thing?
you have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
good.
yes! what are you afraid of hildy? i dare him to move that desk out of here.
you couldn't have known --
but what -- 
i don't know. i don't know what's happening.
it certainly would. germany... vichy would be very grateful.
i sure met some.
we're done.  oh, i should tell you, i don't trust snow.  there's something wrong with him.
we did it!
i'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. and to what end, i ask you?
what?
look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. look for a kind heart.
here.
go to hell, nick mason, what's that supposed to mean --
i hope you solve the case and i know you will, because you're the best.  ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
they'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
set!
me too! me too!
page 41. "deputy dewey oozed with inexperience."
are you alright, wade?
take it easy.  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
well, you never can tell...  i might get a pet. 
ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  and the scenery has definitely improved.
nothing would please me more.
so there you are. so i guess i'm not such a dog as i think i am.
why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? you bitch and complain... if i thought like you, i would have slit my wrist already.
how?
how much?
so you don't do any of those things.
i mean, that'd be too creepy. with us working together and all.
looks like we're missing two. stone and kkinsa.
where have you been?
a lot of people died.
well, yeah.
explosive decompression.
after dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. big.
don't you have a maid?
and i don't believe you...
i'm begging you...please don't kill me! please!
seriously, ben... i need to keep pretty low-key around here. maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. that was the landlord.
sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. but nothing less, either...
i'd love one.
so you didn't come from the poorhouse!
yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
mr. sulu, switch to manual control!
that's easily arranged. but first, back into bed.
impossible.  once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  mars will go into global meltdown.--that's why the aliens never turned it on.
i don't know.  um...i'm just antsy.
maybe they went out for the evening. let's leave them a message and head home.
what do you mean?
you're damn right!  i'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
why do i have to keep looking at you?
can it work?
am i running away?
a jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. while i was talking to frank on the golf course.
what do you mean?
i've been working night and day.  i haven't had time.
thank you for calling central services. i am sorry, due -
by the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. we'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
yes.
send a man there. a secret agent.
brad. please don't tell mom and dad...
i don't have a choice. keith's been grading me really hard lately.
g'bye, ms. sindell.
what'd i touch?!
of course you have three days.
yeah i know.  i did.
has caesar ever seen him?
how could it not?
right. but gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. have to be careful who we pick.
yeah.
you know what we're saying!
am i wrong!
it's nothing. i'm just tired.
nah... scotch.
he definitely wasn't a midget.
you get to travel around and stuff? i mean, better places then this?
eh, fine.
please, mirtha.  i'll start working for augusto.  i'll talk to him tonight. i'll do something.
i can't do that. not while the joker's still at large.
the poor girl's out of a job.
for rape and murder.
and did you?
we'll be all right.
and so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
i want to do it right.
it would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
tell me where i can find her.
did they take your clothes?
can't see a thing.  are you sure?
harold!
oh you wouldn't talk, well i didn't have my make up man there.
yeah, i'm-i'm-i'm a wreck.
who?
how do you mean?
visual.
i can't go out to california.
sorry.  if i did, i didn't mean to.
what?
no --
oh, yes.
okay.
you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
he's fallen asleep, as usual.
maybe the bureau. or those bastards at treasury. i'll take care of it.  i hate this shit, johnny. you cut their balls off for me. i'm counting on you.
i don't want to...i have scary dreams.
well, do you still plan to get married?
where the hell are you taking us anyway? just blow something up already.
you really do?  ~ god -- how come you know them?
well, you tell her majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  what the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
come on, at least try one.  it took me two hours to make these.
what's the problem with sam wilder's place?
fine.
some favor. i hope they know you're not like wendy.
yes?
because i want to.
yeah.
so -- you want me to send one out there ... okay.  i'll see what i can do.
can you at least let me in?
do you have the suspect in custody?
how could i?  dave, as you know, president kennedy was assassinated on friday.  a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby.  we've heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and we've been advised you knew oswald pretty well.
get me a typewriter.  i'll finish the notice.
order out like a philistine, when you got the galloping gourmet here?...
nothing could be better...
naturally enough, your understudy.
i was saved at the last minute.
we had it done last christmas. would you like to see it?
no shit. like johannes brahms?
yes. unfortunately it's bullshit. the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
nothing.  i said nothing.
do what?
where's mom?
thought so.  turned out he wanted me for something else though.
shit.
but everybody's heard of him, he won the congressional medal of honor, he saved a dozen men.
the miracle kid.
well, then appoint miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
yah. yah. home a paul bunyan and babe the blue ox.
i don't even know how much money that is.
oh god no. this is just junk i have for sale or trade. the record room is off-limits.
you don't owe me anything. we're on the same team.
and i think that the security of the country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  gemme a federal judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
do you have a guy like me every year? a guy to... i don't know, make a show of. teach other kids lessons and stuff?
hey...
yeah? and what are you going to do tonight?
thank you.
oh, i'm sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i musn't do!
g'night.
you're a bastard.
everyone, it's woody!
don't try and change the subject.  oh god, it feels great!  he's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
she's fucking nine years old! jesus christ.
are you seeing anyone? i mean, seriously?
hello ....  give me ....  well ....  ?
thanks.
you want...
well, mister beauchamp... from what i read of this here book, i'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
i know what the fuck he looks like!
well, i know you're busy...
how did you know i was here?
your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. did you know that?
tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
he's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  he sees a shrink in l.a.  he's all fucked up. now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... if he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  he must be stopped at all costs.
now ask him who his mother was.
hide them?  on a date with pilots?  i'm talking about how you make them show!
fifteen dollars.
that's my business. harry.
we have met ...
oh, god yes please.  thanks, man. i'll take you up on that.
i don't have to do a god damn thing.
they won't listen.
i was willing to shoot captain renault, and i'm willing to shoot you.
yes.
i thought you'd be pleased.
i told you she's just..
i can't wait till i actually get to touch one of them.
i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "if you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." and i'm laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag.
who does?
was it a nice funeral?
i think that just might be it!  although it could be riki-tiki-tavi.
john, play the sinatra.
no way.
charlie luciano.
listen to her? <u>her</u>? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?
see the thing is i could make it really easy on you -- i already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. this is so awkward asking like this, i'm sorry --
pardon?
thought you hated sidnaw.
see you next week!
no!  you're one of them.  of course, it makes perfect sense!
i got held up at a wedding in tai koo. ricky here yet, i need to get his requests.
would you like me to take you through your lines?
kill him! finish it!
what about hard work?
roger.
you won't do that.
i've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. yurilivich?
since colosimo bit it, i gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
i should have hired this man.  get somebody up there!
excuse me?
is this the only way?
they're your fans, your audience-
come on, come on! we gotta keep moving!
she's the winner and we're going to state.
where can we go?
that le renard has the power to lead his people into the light, i know well.
thank you, samuel.
donde vamos? [where are we going?]
i can't sleep.
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
let's not think about what i want. how about anywhere you want.
there is nothing in that statement the president can't explain.
oh her.
jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about mr. lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? well--that was *you*. someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. this country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! and when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
but, why?  tell me why.
yes.
yeah...fine.
doesn't matter.  doesn't make one bit of difference.  oh god, george, how'd this happen to me? how'd i end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
my what?
and what about your own hand?
do you...have any more packages to deliver?
where are your parents?
you don't think i had anything to do with it?
can i sit on the stairways now?
you should take this seriously.
you can cut the bow.
got a meeting uptown.
you're welcome, john.
what is this interest you've got in her?
i have no intention of getting used to it.
i was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
good. our first request is that you allow us to build a road. you have no roads in tibet. we can discuss the plans in lhasa. when you return.
i'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. i'm tired of people saying babe brother this, babe brother that. what's my name?
what, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
you don't have a clean glass in the house.
we cleared 22 here.
grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
kane?  charlie?  where is he?
forget her, she's a pain in the ass. let her hang there.
he has typhoid fever, ma'am.
don't bother. mrs. brown'll be along for it in a minute.
you forget what i went through to give ya the best.
who's your daddy!
faith, i've seen it already, okay? if i spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, i'll recognize him from the photo. otherwise, i'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
bela, he talk.  loretta, she talk. but tor, he no talk.
go on. take your bath. i'll beat it.
oh yeah?
we oughta stay somewhere outta the way. not in no holidays or ramadas or motel six. if johnnie farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
at the zoo.
for ten more minutes they love him, wally.  i'm sick of him and i'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
is he all right? why didn't you call me? where was he?
don't be silly -– you're going to make summer better for them...
and then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well i just saw him. a stranger -- looking at me -- and i knew suddenly that all my life i'd been --
you are, i was about to say, no longer eligible.
stop, mathilda! don't talk like that!
it's your hand, buckaroo.
but he'd have to. if he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
mr. liebkind, wait ...
he does that every single day.
bates.
on the contrary, you're not strange. and that in itself is confusing. i have the same idea about shangri- la. the sense that i've been here before, that i belong here.
the chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
maintenance.
what's he like?
and i guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
yep.
selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
you'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
why are you here??
they are here. i know they are. listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
the thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. nothing. i've always hated her for that.
and still got a sense of humour. that's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  ok, before i loan you this, i expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, crystal? that's sunday, ok?
i was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. i must have acted like an idiot.  what does it say about the reception last night?
he said it's being arranged. he said jimmy will know.
i'm sorry, i can't possibly take them paul. i'm overrun with refugees. as soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
none of the servants is to touch a gun!  you know that!
no, you don't understand. i've been inside malkovich when i'm with maxine...
look at you, you-you're such a clown.
what for? they don't bother me if i don't bother them.
yes.
it hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. as a matter of fact, you're looking at it. the remains of margo channing. sitting up. it is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps.
i'm here.
you take charge.
it was only a mouthful!
yes.
care to join me?
they took my daughter.
dead at forty-one.
shut up, you zombie!
we each face death every day we're alive, saavik.
i have my own little island.
it's marked.  also there's june twenty third.  and this year -- march twenty first.  those are the ones ...
i mean, it's not true, is it?
no fair! you lured him with produce.
terrorist.  radical agitator.  stool pigeon.
then i owe you some thanks...
we tried.
what two policemen?
i love you so much, and i hate this war so much. oh, it's a crazy world. anything can happen. if you shouldn't get away, i mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever i'll be, i want you to know...
you don't have to make a pose of it.
yes. and i hate that in a woman.
why?
...well, i've got a large family.
they'll be wanting it back.
just a spoiled brat of a rich man. you and westley'll make an ideal team.
that's right. i only have one vote. we'll go talk with anthony and figure it out.
me too.
you know what i'm talking about.
if it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
don't worry about it -
would you like to sell it?
...piece of mind.
re-runs?
um, hi, i'm ted peloquin. i'm here to take mary to the prom.
noted.  thank you.   miss costello was a rebuttal witness.  her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
i can never decide what i like better. leaving home, or coming back.
you're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  can't you tell us something.
when did you write it?
kid, the plain fact is...you are. i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. technically, they absolved you. you and i know what really happened. you pushed it. you are responsible and you'll always carry that. you know what, i'll carry it too. i should have taken you out of that cockpit. i guess i'm a hopeless romantic... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. it's no trade-off. it's not one for one. what you learned isn't worth his death. it couldn't be. but maybe there is some value in it. i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you. now the question is, what will you do with it. if it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. that's one good thing. you were an accident waiting to happen.
good.
i'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in london.
good point.
annabelle let's get something clear.
just a little something of my own.
excuse me?
excuse me?
sure i'm sure. and just what are you implying? i'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. what's maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? you're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. not by a longshot.
and all those like you.
... well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
our present.
if we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
and you're so beautiful.  what are you doing here?
i thought you were sixteen.
do you know what a singularity is, miller? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  it is nothing. absolute and eternal nothing. and if god is everything, then i have seen the devil.  it's a liberating experience.
people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boy's town in cuidad leon--
no one. but i'm a little nervous.
off the record, i'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
i understand. thank you, my name is galvin. i'll be at the following number in a half an hour. it's urgent.
oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
father...
don't fuck with me. i don't want to hurt you.
keri.... laurie... how about if i just call you mom?
what difference does it make?
well, life isn't that simple. so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? that has nothing to do with either fear or love.
well, i guess i'll...get down to the station.  it was lovely meeting...
it's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
mmm. wal, me, i just enjoy maikn' things up. yessir. escape... it's when i can't write, can't escape m'self, that i want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. mm...
but miami pd wasn't part of the j.i.t.  and from what alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
i called my wife!
no.
he frightened you and he hurt you. it's not your fault. it's his fault. tell us who he is so we can find him. stop him from doing this to other women.
no! mercutio!
no.
no problem, sir!
what's that? you have to speak up.  i'm a little deaf in this ear. between that and my wooden leg i'm a mess. compliments of the united states army artillery corps.
a word of caution, sire: we all remember what happened to robespierre, danton and marat. put the marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
you'd know better'n me.
thank you, jane.
maybe not. i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. when it turned out it was you, i made sure we'd run into each other...
you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
twenty on my man...
i never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
you really want to go?
no...
and caesar!  let's not forget to serve caesar!
depends.  you got a memo?
right.
yes.
clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
what do you mean?  you talkin' about coppin a plea?
bye.
like you said, just gotta know how to handle 'em.  old fred wasn't up to it.  we know that we're doin', wyatt.
fine.
is there anything i can do?
just get the fuck outta here.
to bring the word of god.
why?
could he speak english? emilio couldn't speak english.
no, you just act like you do.
my mother and i used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
bye mrs. sennett.
you got a great ass!  i love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
take...take a year.  take six months.  whatever you want.  who knows?  maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
a new magazine! i never saw it before.
not that tunnel, the other one!
when i'm dead--  or fucking.
luck! whaddya mean, luck?
i'm here.
you're out of your mind!  how can you get away with this?
keep climbing.  i will follow...
the way she looked at me, ramona! she hates me now. i think i've made a great mistake. she's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
sit here.  cognac -- for you?
i'm glad you think so. if you ask me, it's foolish. i told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. we could make new york in less than three hours.
earl williams. the reprieve.
we do.
what can you steal from a man already lost his life?
to have stopped this creature? yes!
call.
i should have been honest with you, right from the start.  i wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  i was born to murder the world.
i am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. without me you'd still be twirling a baton at u.c. santa barbara. <u>you're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
you mean the nature of this conversation?
i'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
got it.
what else?  you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
no.
didn't mean to?  you put your sword right through his head!
san francisco. it was the last week. i went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. anyway... i found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. every performance. then, when the show went east - i went east.
they're already dead.  they can't feel a thing.
you the only cat don't come on with that "whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
i guess living up here makes people look older.
gabriel, i love him!
can you pick peaches?
we ran down that church hill info. she's right.  there is no richard taupin.
the emperor?
but the sith lords are involved! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  they're probably looking for him... i'm no match for the sith. this is a jedi's work.  this is your responsibility!
and it is my pleasure to be here.
nothing!  what the hell are you doing down there?
that's not a spear. it's a pike.
ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  this guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  he's playing a game with us.  who will he imitate next? maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  just to prove he's better than all of them.  they got caught; he didn't.
wait!  stop!  don't give them the satisfaction.  i know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! are you going to throw it all away now??
you talk to bickerman?
no. he was strong, he lasted almost a month. my mother - died when i was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... after he left me, i had nobody. i was ten years old.
come off it, bugs.
well, we're here.  and more importantly, he's here.  we'll cut back on everything else.
it's actually quite amusing, majesty. it's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
what are you doin' here?
thanks... you can keep the doll.
well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
anybody else have a key to the house.
no! they will be the judge of that! and so will i... if you shame me!
what did he do?
<u>no</u>!  do not encourage this little... person.
the weed.
both.
but i'm a married man. i got a couple of kids. i can't get mixed up with—
you sick. you got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
it's a rave!  boy, if i ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
excuse me.
my brother's in jail.
radiation level...constantly rising...
oh no! not in <u>my</u> name.
do you know what "normal" is?
thank you, donny.
have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  from my own fishery.  they buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my house.
yeah.
i know her friends.
...they hold on to their money...
they were for the fucking boat, brian.
home.
no! the man in the moon!! who's driving this thing?
bye....
keep 'em busy.
it's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
if everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
ethan, tell me -
this i had to see myself.
trust him.
what?
oh.
heard you got remarried! congratulations. didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
i thought this was practically a done deal --
that sudden?
so that gives you something.
look, sorry. don't say a word.  i know this is improper. i've been trying to speak with deputy director koessler. i left a message. i must speak with you before you go back to washington.
i love it here.
he won't know you're carryin' it. c'mon, you gotta help me out.
by reading the book of the dead.
well, now i feel so much better.
higher.
now, why in the hell would you assume that?
these murders are his masterwork.  his sermon to all of us.  to all us sinners.
can you tell me how you spell...
no shit? dick, that's great!
but if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
whatever's right.
don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. will i don't know, chuck. it's kinda outta the way.
the monitor! i never ask twice.
as scripted?  you've already lost two of your own.  how many more are you willing to sacrifice?
let me get a shot of it.
wouldn't happen to be the lincoln memorial, would it?
yeah, but didn't you love vanessa when you married her? if you love someone once, you can love them again, i know it. my friend leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. you're just not trying.
fuck do you want?
are you in the service?
of course. wow... you look extremely beautiful.
why should i be?
what are those mirrors for?
what - the curtains?
i read, cooch.
isn't there a guard?  a janitor? a fucking cleaning woman? i'll take a burglar!  somebody's gotta be in th...
you think so?
give up being a croupier, jack. or i'll shop you. all you have to do is keep your word. it's that simple.
this is your home. it's not nowhere. and it's not dull.
it was great. we had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. and then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
no. i will not.
ain't been too good...no sir, not too good...gettin' old, ethan...
in case???!!! in case of what? in case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
i believe that decision rests with her majesty.
check.  then i just hang with these guys, right?
from the rhineland originally.
it'll be fine, marty.  you'll be fine. good luck. he stuck his hand out and marty shook it. but there was still a question that was nagging at him...
dr. argon, i know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  the situation is critical right now.  the replicators are growing exponentially.  if we wait much longer it will be too late. you have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
there is no letter.
yes?
ya got that right.
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
i'm not sure. i haven't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival.
well, you are his grandfather. he is supposed to spend some time with you. you're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
they own the whole building.  they just move from floor to floor.
no...i'll be ok for a week.
i hadn't thought about it.  understand me, gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing.  it doesn't bother me one bit, but i don't get off on it.
stool pigeon.
--torn down in the name of convenience--
i hate hospitals. you're so... so goddamn useless...
we want that money -- now!
go back. i'm going to kill him.
no, this is serious. say it backwards.
disintegrated?
hey, mon, i don't know what your trip is, but...
he must be behind that curtain. relax. we're undercover. we need to give off the appearance of calm. you see esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. act as a gentile would.
but...
that's right on my way.
you get any sleep last night?
i'm unmarried. i'm not available.
you two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
barbara.
nobody?!  what's her name?
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week.  she's a fucking mess, joe.  your sister is a fucking mess.  she needs you.  i talk to her more than you do.
well, mr. feldman, i don't believe in thinking small.  so i've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "the vampire's tomb," "the ghoul goes west"... and "doctor acula"!
how are you?
taransky isn't that good an actor. no, they're taking special precautions.  some kind of new encryption.
i'm sorry, claudia.
is that good?
some men just tried to kill me!
sideways -  for every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
yes! yes! hallelujah!
for chrissake, <u>please</u>!  help me celebrate!  i figured it out!
any friends?
yeah, sure.
the yellow one.
i do not want those cigarettes.
and the ocean!  a mountain range!
i'm afraid not.  he looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  but it's probably temporary. he got all the way to lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. i'm sure it'll all come back to him.  it just takes a catalyst.
you tell me.
the argies.
you got some guts for a rich kid. i guess you and me could be buddies.
oh, david... i'm sorry i caused you that much pain.
well, he got away, didn't he?  riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
she's, uh, sleeping.
what are you dialing?
yes.
black market?
please. i'm sorry. i'll see it through. what do you want me to do?
i think you're lying.
i haven't set foot off dry land since i was twelve, when the ship i was on exploded.  it's been a sound policy.
hi-ya... i'll call you back.  now then...
you're certain?
but one suggestion, madame.  not the major.  i don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. i'll overlook his bad punctuation. but the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  and one lipstick ...  scarlet number four.
yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
i don't have a choice.
... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.
you're coming with us...
personally, i don't know what mr. cedar's raving about. from what i can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
i will, dad.  bye, luv you.
i'm married.
oh, a party! great, great! jolly times and merry pranks. that's me. i'm a guy who loves parties. you know—
well, you do reside their at 1425 fremont terrace?
hong kong?  i'm not in hong kong.  i'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine, two minutes from the station.  how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
i'm a libra too. that's why we get along so well.
i did do that, didn't i?
yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
i don't think i need a day or two. you're even dumber than you think i think you are. not only that, i'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where i draw the line, escobar.
they're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
all you've got is one life. i guess it's worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that's your whole future. that's as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
that's true.
you flew all the way h...

yes i did. you asshole! what about the room?
i like hearing you talk.  if you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. all the food in vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. how does that sound to you?
call him a love-child, if you want to.  duffy!
wagner...

but that one time --
fine.  i want half.  plus the release of the family.
of course. of course she was married. what else would she be? single? i don't think so.
i always thought you'd follow me up.
who cares what you think. i want you back and that's all that matters.

i don't want to hurt you.

mm. well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. beat ya any way he can. straight for the jugular. very effective.

sir henry derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
do you really think your life is meaningless, eleanor?  is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
that's what makes it romantic. every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. but us -- you never know where i am and i'm not sure where you are. that's romance!

i never knocked over any armored- car. i was sent up for practicing law without a license.

you want to read it?
you'll do it, all right. you fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. that's how it works, buster. if you don't do it, i'm going to throw you out of here. do you understand me? if you don't pay auggie what you owe him. i'm finished with you.

they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.

i don't want anything.  i'm just a really big, big fan.  i've seen all your movies.
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions.  see, we're not even sure which agency harry works for.  now, samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.

that's quite alright. if i may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
oh, thank you, sir.
yes to me or yes to the coil?
how?
actually only one cell survived..
no! let me go!
roy.
you're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl.  we get adler and we beat this thing.
no scars.
is it a good morning?
she wasn't really my wife.
astronomical.
what?
yes.
because it means the tree is older than the house.
are you going to kiss me?
good.  you've got nothing to worry about. soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  and listen, don't talk so loud. take it easy. coast a little.
should i?
it would be the beginning of the end for my family.  how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
but... she was a showgirl.  she didn't have an old convent.
no. no, i'm all right.  oh, god, what have i done? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  i must be crazy, a child like you. oh, god, oh, lord. this is awful, this is terrible, i gotta get outta here!
this is the first book that i got you.
i can make that in a lunch break!  look, hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
what?
'thief in the night?'
sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
in a way.
yes.
people forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
maybe you're not aware of this, crow horse, but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, dna fingerprinting; i don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. leo was killed right here.
we'll pray -- and she'll be there.
nice.
you're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
no, thank you.
is him stayin' here workin' out?
those, over there, there.
was what worth it?
nah, i don't do that anymore...
you're right. i apologize. but i still want to talk to you.
how do you know she did that?
she died in a car accident.
nothing... i was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. they are very interested in the case. swana suspects her countrymen.
dad, why are you acting this way?  is this because of the other morning?
where there's a will, there's a way. come on.
was she helpful?
what's that supposed to mean?
what...?
i'm not sayin' i'm not in love with you.
is it weird?
i know. anyway --
where is he sir?  right in front of me.  what's he doing?  he's on the= phone.  i don't fucking know, his stockbroker! oh shit.  gotta go.
yeah!
listen, at least it's warm in here.
oh sure, it was all mean old marcel's idea. give me a break! we didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! not to mention disgusting. look...
relax, it's casual.
what is your point?
slow down, kid.
yeah.  cheers, mate.
they should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
keep it.
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  that's different.
make sure you come right back, 'cause i'm going to make lunch soon. okay?
you were taken for a buggy ride?
low enough to relay internet traffic.
you wasn't with her?
where were you the day he died?
she plays the clarinet, too.
what about tonight?... whatiya gonna do about mr. eddy tonight?
wouldn't bother me...  i wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was i you...
i can quote that too; "those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
according to you i'm a sexual failure. an animal, you said.  you know now, don't you?
no, we said goodbye outside the building.  he went off, as usual, toward his house.
who's going with you?
neither do i, actually. but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
i have to go.
if it will make you feel any better, i don't have a gun.
how do you know that's the way?
all right. but let's keep the price down. i've called ed concannon. he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
i'd say that about sums it up, exposition.
no, i have my things in the car.
my dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  i mean, there's no possible way.
what do you mean?
if you want to.
she's dead now, too. she was a nanny.
i have no answers.  thanks for the stain.  find the girl.  in the envelope are tickets to the dorothy chandler.  we'll chat again, then.
okay frank.
i think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
...gordon.
just for the symmetry of the thing...?
not yet.  don't say anything yet.  okay?
i was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
you knew what we were asking you to do. don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. the fit isn't right.
you don't want to know.
next week.
the things you gotta remember are the details. it's the details that sell your story. now this story takes place in this men's room. so you gotta know the details about this men's room. you gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. you gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. you gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. and if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
rodents of unusual size? i don't think they exist...
ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  all our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. we would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. now we can say: there is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the doomsday machine.
i cannot confirm or deny actions which i did not witness.
i'm not fbi anymore.
i can't leave.
i can't sleep anymore. it's too much like death.
yeah sure, if i'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
oh. thanks, margaret.
ssh...
you date veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about caitlin. you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for god's sake! you're twenty-two!
what else do you know?
the rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
are you treadstone?
yes. i miss her. she died. two years now.
what won't do?
elliot?
all right -- you don't believe me.
principal of jail. wow. what a promotion.
daddy's dead.
multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.
so mel gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. that'd make the feds dig deeper. he wants an accident.
'cause he's comin' back, that's what for. frank's got you really loaded tonight.
no... i saw the man who killed him.
well, what are you talking about? i just told you i was gonna get a—
i thought redding had like three balls!
doctor, i think i need a neck brace.
how would you like to get a ticket next week? haven't you any romance in you?
there is no weather in space.
i mean tomorrow or the next day.
of course. i'll do what i can. i have to go, before they notice.
what's that?
don't touch me!!
we're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'reform the reds with a rope'.
thanks again for not inviting me. i'm only here on business.
what?
i don't know much about him.
his teacher brought him in to see me. said he'd been acting up in class. creating a disturbance.  i couldn't get a thing out of him.
you're a little angle, you are.
i can't afford slack, brigman.
i did.
you sure shout that?
what?! he's a son of a bitch!
i'm going home!
gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
and your mother -- everything's fine with her?
he doesn't want my help.
touch of the flu.
about 250 million of your miles.
sorry ...
you're saying that christ is the child, and --
you can't!
i need to... i need to believe something. this is the first time i've ever come up against anything i couldn't... understand.
don't you think i know that?  i don't have any choice.
dan, great to see you again. like i said, you need anything at all, i'm your man. i don't envy your job. i mean owen was a...complex man.
sure. that's a good idea. one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
always.
do you think you can get back at your dad that way?  i mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  did you ever think of that?
i don't want someone who'll put up with him. i want someone who will enjoy him, the way i do. do you know what he told my friend tucker? he said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if warren wasn't in my life.  well he is in my life and i'm goddamn lucky to have him. the hell with steve.
no, you stay here with us.  out last night together.
who?  oh.  my friend.  my friend is laura.  a girl.  a friend who's a girl.
i came up here after kevin's father died.  they were very supportive and helped me adjust. i got myself together. i've gotten myself together now, too.
i saw how you're putting mal johnson straight.
this one says, "to mother from amy."
nothing. let's just go fight.
then you're a member... three or four millionaires in here right now.
how long you had these guys?
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  something so bad...?
amy's been lying again.
just one question. did you calculate the risk?
do? hell, nothing. well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but i'm looking for a silent partner. i've done the research, i've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. i'm just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--i want the dough; i don't take attendance.
get the kit!
so all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be. then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite--
i'm going to bail on the other side and wait. this bridge is the only way he can follow.
wick.  they got your crew, too?
- - like birds.  what happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
but the police...
hello.
her name's lorelei ambrosia. she's webster's girl friday.
i am harold ryan, her husband.  i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  i have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
just a car.
shit.  when?
that was beautiful.
it gave me a little chance, and i took it. they won't get me back. i'm going to live, and you're going to help me. yes?
i presume you checked your son’s apartment...
when was all this?
can we just ignore it?
the closet
let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
right.  okay.  bob.  nice to know you.
i don't know about you, guys, but i'm getting a little buzz off this.
and he killed every last one of 'em!
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  that's when she started shooting.  can't blame her. the ring was all carlos left her when he died.
that's very kind of somebody. who do i have to thank?  what happens if i miss the train?
your blood, max.
let's just say i'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
charles. have you been keeping out of my shit? have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
goddamn you, joe, don't make me do this!
huh huh. no way, dude.
well, i have this very pleasant room on carter street -- and i've been getting to some classes --
...that's not what i meant.
all right. stand by.
...please... no...
it was the room of the husband. or of the husbands, i should say. madame has been married three times.
mr. bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. he's telling you you're going! and if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
let's have a toast.
who was it?
moonby, 4th battalion, royal australian regiment, task force. ex-corporal moonby, deserted.
well, fortunately, i know how to counter it.  the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
yes, of course. it was quite a while after. i was just out of grade school when they did that.
you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do. okay, so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. you have a purpose though! remember? let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
she did...?
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
see if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
doctor heller?
call me tomorrow.
why?
i won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. it's an act of defiance.
besides, i don't want to be what you want to make me.
i think television's a dangerous thing.
why did they do all this for chrissakes?--what were they after?
you kill me, mama.
for a time it was astounding.  i saw the years spinning by, i was in the years spinning by.  we made such advances.  i don't understand half of them.  there was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... we must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
you- do you love me?
careful.  that mess on the ground is brains.
if it's not asking too much --  for our information just for illustration  tell us how you intend to run the nation.
you always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  there's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
okay.
we don't have a choice!
alright, i love you.
but, mr. m. -
you have anything to drink? you want to go out and get something?
so, are you having a good time on the island?
what do you mean?
ah-hh, no.
maybe not... i don't know.  i'm not sure i'm gonna go.  she doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
mr. beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
what makes you think that!  if you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, bumstead...
why can't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  ask a few questions.
but she's standing right next to you.
everything's fine, pop.
why?
you know, he's got a point.  we're fucking americans.  we stick out like sore thumbs.
cold is good!
you're telling me.
what is it, a still life?
frank. it's jake. jacob singer.
so damn stupid.
...that's what it is.
good to see you too, elaine.
do it.
look, peter, i don't hate you. but what we had was an illusion. mutual wishful thinking.  we both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
he's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  you understand...
that's... good?
in time.
never mind my ears! go away!
uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
go ahead.
it was nobody. ah... he's a poll, taker. i'm thinking of voting democrat this year. but don't mention it to your father. how was school today?
what's the matter?  what's the matter with you?  you look pale.  you okay?
the orangemen!  now there's a football program.  jim brown.  and that other tailback ... the one with the blood disease ...
you're not?
yeah, i guess.
i've been a bad boy.
no.
she poured it for --
i can live with "great."
could i come with you to getting a gelati?
anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  where the dirt is, shelly.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
let me check on scott. he's hurt bad.
she's hormonal. right, june? it's just part of the whole process.
would you guys...
uh, yeah.
he said he doesn't know.
i think we should talk first.
no.  look, it's me okay?  can't it just be about me?  for once?
yeah, i guess it is. we did it! we did it...damn! we sure did it!
hallelujah, jaffar.
of course i remember him. i'm sorry. you were terribly fond of him.
well, i don't pretend to be an expert.
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world...
this is from the highest authority?
back at you.
where's my family?
and mr. kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
three sixes. is that any good?
you were at 4000 kelvin.  any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
i know. i'm doing shylock instead of a shylock. okay, what's my motivation? the acquisition of money. to collect. inflict pain if i have to.
i think we're about half way.
where you think you are, boy? they probably never seen a olive in this country.
precog deja vu...
think i'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. anybody wanta come with me?
five.
tomatoes.
he's nice.
it came out of me.
hmm.
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  i need to know everything he said.
if you like them, they're for sale. another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
i never saw him. why didn't he show up?
then light the match, paul.
mr. san pedro sula is from honduras.
where's that guy going?
i don't know yet.
uh, yes...i mean...whenever necessary. you know.
the room is filled with poison gas.  the hydraulic system must have blown.
remember, kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
is this a catholic guilt thing...?
you forgot her degree in literature. she's a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it's about?
do what i say.
we got a loose cannon here. and we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
hmm. good night.
hello.
what?
look i don't care about the money right now: i just want some sleep. so if you could be quiet -
i'm out.
i know. i know.  i never promised myself a rose garden.
what's her name?
sure did. i'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so's i could help...
go away -- hide yourself.
oh, i'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
yes...
well, like what did he ask, exactly?
both. now.
i was hoping you could tell me.
i don't need any proof.
yes sir.
no -- she left me!  after her miscarriage, i --
shoulda told the one about shu being the bastard child of mother theresa.
you know dick allen, mesa's casino?
i'm still the boss of all the bosses! and you'll do what i say!
you haven't even heard from him?
sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
no you won't. but it's okay. you have stuff you gotta do.
the one time i want it to work...
oh, i was quite a lively dancer.
even when you infuriate me, i still want to kiss you.
why you say that?  just because i help a lady with her package?
whoa, check it out.
just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
if you're lying, i'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
we've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  but up there, in the face of that cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
did you get her number?
it doesn't matter.  even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  what i do with this is up to me.  i can be a victim, or i can be a volunteer.  and i want to be the volunteer.
but do you mean in? ... but you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
you'd like that wouldn't you? you've hated betty since you were in pep squad together...
well what is it!
we're not.  i'm helping him, yeah--
so i've been informed.
father's back?  still angry?
that's not fair!
i killed him???
oh, not here.  there are too many people around.
don't exaggerate.
a car.
what things?
to the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
you killed a prostitute.
chuckie, what are you talkin'...
anne lively.  john was talking about her right before they took him.
y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
they were wearing ski masks. i told you all of this.
negative. it's impacting on all our systems!
sure! mckinney will never suspect you--
you think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
she's not here.
your doctor?  did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in gstaad?
stop her!
louis... water and fresh straw!
monks bottle their own wine. don't they?
sure.  that's one of my numbers.  it's how many months old my little girl is.
how about i go right, sir?
hello.
good evening, louis. you seem to be very crowded tonight. can you manage a table near the floor?
you're amazing.
he told me. besides, why else would an a.t.f. man be after him?
-- this is mr. laszlo.
it's not that long.
it's not us, they were scared before we got there.  what do we know?
we all, had to look at the body. it was awful, kiki -- awful!
well, he offered, and i just couldn't refuse. his car overheated.
well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to christine for some good reason. so i think it's great. it's time. you've got to have your eyes open, that's all. i mean, look at me. i thought victoria and i were set for life.
i'm a greek, thank you.  and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians.  give our new colleague some of the cretan white.  relax, tell me everything, i'm your friend.
no.
yes, mama.
that's a bit much.
it's fine. mind your own meal...
then what will you say?
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  and pretty lucky for you.
no, no ... we wouldn't do it.
she said michael.
thanks.  to you too...
no. i - i'm just curious, you know. i was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. that's all.
i'm sorry, i've never seen any of them.
i don't know...
what the--
wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
the pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
well, why'd you have to tell that indian story?
...but who cares?  it was just--  it was fabulous.
the job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  she couldn't have lived with it.  i know that now.
four or five days.
yeah, well, i'm in l.a. now.
plenty of room for two people.
oh my gosh...
not too bad.
don't ask.
they said it was here. they told me this morning.
oh yes, certainly. certainly, herr director!
no, no james, it's not like that.  tony and china, they're just friends.
i'm not married.
they can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
sure they did....
we don't know.
you look beautiful.
i'm sure you are.
it makes perfect sense.  field work is not our oeuvre.
i'll go, but i want my money right now!
a man after my own heart...
i'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'rule, britannia'.
fuck you!  <u>you</u> come out here.  hey, toss me that j.d.
i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, i believe everything, a little.
move slow and move quiet.
perhaps i did... until fear turned into panic. that’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “you don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “we’re in deep trouble,” he said. “we,” he said. “we.”  we’d both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. we had to stop you and friedman meeting...
you've got to face the things you feel.
do they have a show to give it to you?
take it easy?! why do you think i sent it home in the first place?  so it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
your birth stone.  i thought --
you don't want to hear about it?
kirshner does not apply. kirshner was in kentucky.
don't tread on the earth?
uh-huh.
yes... i remember...
that's more like it. goodnight, old buddy.
... wrote it, yeah.  i'm the bad guy.
isn't there an easier way?
a new disease.
what?
the future, mr. gittes. the future. now where's the girl?... i want the only daughter i have left... as you found out, evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
... in texas... didn't it?  that's what happened... oh my god.
it's fine.  tell me what--
i can't believe elliot and i can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
there, there, lie quiet now.  you just had a bad dream.
too much excitement. how about the surrey. can you fix it?
even your own wife, numa.  any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
no. what is happening?
i just wonder how that happened.
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
listen to yourself, frances. the resistance, the anger in your voice.
he was?
oh? more jewish police? you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit. i see!
absolutely.
so what? where's it say in this script he's white? color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. the way it is now, ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  so whatta you think of the script?
that wouldn't be too good, would it?
yes. whenever... all right, look. whenever i see a man that i think is attractive, i wonder what it would be like with him, i mean, i'm just curious, i don't act on it, but i hate that i think that!! i wish i could just forget about that stuff!!
the red sox were my world. i surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
i beg your pardon, i'm not an asshole.  i'm an actor.
if you wanna help, then help. if not, shut up.
this is business.  there was an accident in maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
alright, alright...i'll call you back.
egyptian mail. morning edition.  run!
get some sleep.  see you tomorrow.
it's like a pop your cherry party. everyone's saying it's 'fuck or die' time.
arrest that man!  he's committed to our care.
sometimes the prey bites back.
it smells funny. like gasoline.
because i can't have you!
not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny california was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
it happened to you before?
oh, wait.  one sec.  open the window.
you still believe in god?
i mean it!  no one else would have helped. i take it all back, everything i've said about you.
i thought it was a pretty good beginning.
have now.
not really. it's completely inert. no sound or energy sources have been detected. the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. a laser drill
really? to italy?
what about it?
you mean, like, "he has the cutest butt"? where did i hear that recently?
i think we should say some words over the grave.
i gave him twenty.
that's why we won't take the train. cookie showed me where there's a farm house. they got a boat there.
you're insane.
that's absurd --
so's mine.
it's like the voodoo dolls of west africa. the kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
no!
but, sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
there are better things.  you see the importance of the "moment".  ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. he'd have suffered it.  this way, he already departed. without knowing.
kyle...
ah, you must forgive me, my dearest marie-louise, i saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at schonbrunn.
the two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't maurice miller, is it? i've seen snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
then you got undressed.
i don't know. marcie's got me paranoid.
yesterday.  afternoon.
you know why i want to do it. just do it.
no.  no.
what is it?
i'm not boffing matthew !
yeah, yeah, i was awake anyway so i figured—  they got it made. eat all they want— fly around like crazy— sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.
i'm a human being, i've got some!
sorry, cooch. i lost eagle bear --
what?!
what's his family background?
they always pick rachel up early on thursday.
what's this all about, tyler?
i don't know. why don't you ask them sir.
and it's good!
you had a son.
i don't know... some people are okay, but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody.
honey, she's perfect. she works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. and they love her, even brother likes her though he won't admit it. i think she's just perfect.
i wish there was one i wanted.
um, i'm gonna need a bag. if you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
no.  i found something new.
why not?
i felt like it.
i'm alright.
yeah. why are you asking?
you want to be like that, swann? mud and shit?
what religion do you profess, preacher?
where are you taking me?
i'm mike.
i told walter.
i dunno. whatever will be will be...
he's been like that all day.  hey danny, you coming?
he knows what he has to do....
intensely.
take me somewhere.
thought you were dead.
heís putting on a show, barnes.
hold those rights.
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar. is this lieutenant dunbar?
that's me.
my boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  if we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  it's hard to be miss perversity when you're the only one at the party.  d'you know what i mean?
yes! remember? you asked me for an application? i introduced you to the manager?
yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
it's okay, stephen, i --
sure.
the contract was stolen.
hey, fuck you.
what you do to me is unfair. the teasing, i mean.
who?
captain morton.
i'll bet you're a real yo yo.
i'm -- i'm sorry.
my fucking heart bleeds.
mother used to sing the songs in german and her voice would echo across the valleys
an abortion, stupid.  i had an abortion the day before yesterday. so you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  bye-bye, baby!
she thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
yeah.
nothing. are you alright?
do you know how you will use him?
someplace safe. how you feeling?
what makes sense, is all.
yeah.
mr. mcquire.
it's real.  i'm telling you, it's real.
it was a long time ago, at some heaven and hell mixer.
soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
no. never. you'll have to kill me.
something awful happened last night.
jeez.  think he's got room for one more?
we can stop him.
it's a little late for me.
i'm here...
she touches me down there with a cigarette.  please mommy, don't touch me like that any more. i'll be good,  i won't be a baby any more.
and how hard it hit?
i spoke with the woman who saved your life. you're lucky she came along when she did.
no, sir. of course, sir. good day, doctor.
johnny, why won't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
the mirror.  you can't see yourself in it.
kablooey.
where did it originate?
a drink.
should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists? why i became a murderer? because murder ... is bliss.  it's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
bruce, you know i'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  walter!
cool.
yeah. me too.
santos... i can't...
very funny. very funny.
otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
knew what?
the war...
what?
no! luke, run away, far away. if he can feel your presence, then leave this place. i wish i could go with you.
that's what it says. you drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
go fuck yourself.
i've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
so, <u>we know</u>.  we know it went through a black hole.  we saw it.  norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  it'd go in some report like some big discovery.  so in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>but they didn't</u>.  the called it an unknown entry event.
i don't know. mr. sampson bought it for me.
dr. mccurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in mr. marsh's condition?
no, we should reach the base of the brain shortly. and from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
sure, carnation. like in that movie you rented, audrey rose.
come on, doc.  he only went to bed a few hours ago.  can't you wait till later?
is he your boyfriend?
organa major is a rebel system. there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
like your father... so human.  all units functional, recorders are on... scanning sector one. foliage in fully developed state of growth. temperature, twenty- two point two celsius.
too much.
hmm.
no more drapes to hang.  now what should we do?
what do you mean what are we going to do?
kim-lo?
well, i'm a college graduate --
nothing.
i know.
let me go first; you stay behind me.
shit, i bet i been laid more'n you have.
such a shame, too.  cause you made such a good impression the first time.
yeah, but it doesn't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
right.
aw, come on, kid. throw me a bone. i'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
frankly sir, you look a little like my father. probably explains the curious feeling of love i have for you.
what?
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlain's men.
i don't want his money.
what do you mean?
you know her?
it's got to be going better than this..
just for fun, i guess.
you know the thing i love about mustangs? the steering wheel.
well, i've got to read them first. suppose i could get a coke while i do?
i flushed it down the toilet.
bullshit!  prove it.
that's right.
no... no, thanks. a bit early in the day for spirits.  well, i guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? i never married; i don't see much of the "old college gang"; i'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  what's on your mind, gavin?
you will??
mood swing. i'm manic depressive.
you're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
i wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  that bear had to be surprised.
you first.
we'll finish it tomorrow... goodnight, bobby.
ahhh.  and is there -- a doll?
have some cigars.
and when was that?
i was offered that job as a waitress.
you do?
how d'you mean?
i don't know. the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband.
how about your two friends?  you don't have a man dying in there, do you?
seeya tomorrow.
yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. how far are you prepared to help me?
i used to play this piece back in high school.
fucking northern monkeys.
i'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
now listen...
no.  no, you didn't.
they may have been friends of hers.
then let's get started... it's senseless to waste any more time.
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up, i'm telling you.
yeah, but it didn't go so good. he wasn't the man i thought he'd be. theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
no.
i am?
when are you leaving berlin?
what could we get for them?  i don't know.  buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...i don't know...hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  all told...must be, i'd... three bucks a throw...i don't know.
it's true -- i know her.
dwayne.
i don't know, honey.
i can't find him.
for how long?
i'd like that.
i guess not. you'll be heading east from here, huh?
yeah. you know, one of those toy things. they sent me to the store to get it.
then i will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a bene gesserit.
you wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. but if you wanna give it to minnesota fats... nothing doing. what do you say?
i exaggerated.
well it's been a while, but i don't recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
no, no... there's plenty for everybody... oh, max, this is sam... and the frog brothers...
aw, you'll be okay. less than a mile.
that's what i came to talk to you about.
a what?
a deer?
dodge, get on that turbine. i don't care if you don't sleep for a week. the sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. how's the food situation?
why me?
i make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do i want?
no, i don't...no.  i thought we were just friends.
we shouldn't have been here, epps.  there is a war going on!
why do i always have to answer the phone?
alright, so i'm gonna transfer you over to frank's assitant, janet she's gonna see what she can do --
what could there be except just another hill? in any event, i'm not curious. at the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. i'd give anything to be in london right now.
the bristo police department.  look out the window.  you see the car?
of course, my dear. what can i do?
martins.
what is that?
i like the diminished risk.  it frees up capital reserves.  i like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  you can predict their behavior....
no, mr. conway, i'm not lying. what reason could i have for lying? the chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but i'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
maybe not. [beat] but i do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. and i'm just trying to help you the only way i can think of.
very good. now we play round 2.
this is ohio. if you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
what's the use of fighting, hildy?
no... i am looking for the eiffel tower.
why are you telling me this?
and you've got me all figured out?
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings. you don't like it, do you ?
don't worry about it. you listening to me? now, come on. we gotta go see paulie.
...the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars...
i can't find any lever! help me indy!
insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people i put away with alternate futures?  my god, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
forget it, doll.  after all, you work here - i work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
will you shut up... just give me a drink.
i ain't stupid.
with you.
hey, don't do that.  i said i wasn't a pro, remember?
cut it out, susan.  you and i've got to talk.  big day tomorrow, everybody.  joe, let's go.
that's right. -- rubbers, too, i hope? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
i've heard so much about this club of yours. i had to come and see.
barry, you're over thirty years old. you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey.
three o'clock.
very good.
great, mom.
thomas franklin, an attorney.
mister data, set a pursuit course. maximum warp.
well, we can't force her. it's her decision.
oh, how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. to show me the way.
what are you talking about?
because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.
and anyway, what do i know about guerrilla warfare?
sorry.
that's a hell of a good age to be.
you're positive of that, aren't you?
i'll offer you more than it's worth. and you know you won't have to move. nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
only twelve miles away! he could be here day after tomorrow.  find your man, sir! captain beams will give you the message.
what?
prepare yourself, drew - i am --
i stole four beers from my dad.
nothing.
of course not.
i'll never be able to do that.
why, honey?
you was our first supreme commander, terry. keep out of sight and i'll tell him you're out.
hi ralph. oh danny, how'd you find me here?
a photon torpedo?
and how did you feel when you ate this guy?
i don't know, eight or nine.
that dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. i know, ridiculous.
great carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that. and i'm not sure i can....  okay, that's a lie. i just don't want to be alone back there anymore. if you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
you don't have to make conversation with me, i'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
you'll hit something!  can't you go higher?
impossible?
wait a minute! really? really? i happen to teach a class at columbia called "tv media and culture"! so i think that my insights into mr. mcluhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
my inside pocket.
god, i should know. your hair was red. i remember it matched the wallpaper.
it's mrs...it's claire...spencer.  from next door.  is everything--
yeah, that one.
have another drink, thelma.
estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
william has just turned down anna scott.
they tried and died....  jessica!
a rose by any other name would --
i never thought about it.
what are you up to?
you're marking us, bill.
how's he going to want the gold?  he couldn't even know we had it.
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
i have to go. he sighs.
billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
why can't i be like you jack? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it.  say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
why don’t you ask when i left the mondrian?
i couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
better eat it quick. it won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
she asked about you, madmartigan.
you're dealing with a psychopath. he gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
after a ways.
yes, miss betsy.  i mean that.  the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa.
what else?
who's under arrest? you pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
fine, i'll fuck off, but not til i say something.
uh...
get it.  from outside, if you have to.
...he's derivative...
another, frank . . . ?
well. shall we get to it? would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
blow out the candles!
saavik. send to ambassador sarek. tell him we're coming in.
she's really cute and she's really nice.
a man has my family.  gold watch here. dark tan.
and you never cried -
sollozzo is a dead man, i don't care what it costs.  i don't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york.  the tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  i don't care if we all go down together.
the law. well the law is a human institution.
well, not too, i mean, a little.
what!?
she wants a divorce.
a theatre poet?
goodbye?
it's okay.
most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  you're good.
yes, that's good planning. tell me, are you a regular, candy, in this computer club?
i remember...from always...at first i prayed to you...come and get me... take me home...you didn't come...
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah... because i've bought options on property all over town.  i need max's financing...
she's a witch, that one. i tell you what happen yesterday?
really?
no, he didn't do that.
you are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  who i have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
i didn't do anything --
well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? like audrey hepburn.
forty-five.
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due. and i believe that i'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
no that's it.
see, it couldn't have been me. i was in jail, remember?
if he tricked me into loving him, is what i meant.
no fucking way.
in the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
you know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
it's in the past.  i'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  no hard feelings.  we need to move on.  and besides, i'm sorry, too.
he tried to warn us ...
that's the way it's done.
you're lying...!
they're always winning. until they lose.
oh no, no.  you're not bothering him.  he has lots of time since he's been retired.
oh, now, i'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
what are you talking about?
they look like they're jumping.
ben is very ill.
what did you do tonight?
no no no, tucker, thank you.
i don't like people snooping around my stuff.
son, lots of people tell me i'm a gifted man, but i still can't see around corners.
he's trapper john! only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a boston and maine railroad car! when the conductor caught him in there with his winter carnival date, she screamed: 'he trapped me!' what have you been doing since those days, trapper?
he is a capable man.
i visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes i've been seeing in newsweek.
yes, he is... look, bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when i say next train, this time i mean it!
we haven't got a spare place.
oh my god...
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
here! this is it!
what about janet?
you're not gonna believe the first picture i ever saw.  your friend's.
i'm using an old phonographic turntable.
oh, it wasn't my secret, richard. victor wanted it that way. not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. that was his way of protecting me. i knew so much about his work, and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
he'll be all right.
never do that again.
frank would open you.
just between you and me, i never intended taking it off.
we can be rich if you say the word. i had dinner with the guizots last night.
i cannot believe this.
what is it, sergeant?
somethin', huh?
cheers.
sure.
m'sieu ...
does jack like to jack off?
you hate raoul?
i got the twister game for later ...
remember my promise.
i swear to god, i'll fucking puke.
how should i know?
i... they're all dead, bud.  they're all dead. i thought... some of them... you know...
i can't tell you that.
you mean...
i don't know. i don't understand dickie, marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
i'm tired of hearing about it. there's no shark.  sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. dad didn't die because of it...it's all wrong... some fantasy you've concocted...you keep bringing it up.
in order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. comprende?
holly -- that's not so.
i think so.
"i get cancer, and i kill joe."
that's a big book you're writing.
i swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. the best plastic surgeons in the world, ben. you had the best --
we started over, you can too.
please stay.
i wouldn't talk.
...i... i know what you are.
this bad cop. he checked you into the			  * discount inn. then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
we are...  "south of the border down mexico way."
good.  vito, you trust that mook too much.  so does pop.
saavik... is... david with you?
i tremble with fear! you're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound!
then so was mine...
bet you thought you'd never see me again.  i didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
what's wrong, jimmy? tell me what's wrong --
in my office?
not a chance.
she's quite pretty.
no, it's better if he doesn't. the house is filled with new people.
hundred dollars?
no, toto, nobody said it. i say it! life's not like you saw it in the movies. life...is harder.  get out! go back to rome. you 're young, the world is yours! and i'm old...i don't want to hear you talk any more, i want to hear talk about you.
we been seein' you all along the way.
try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and i won't have to hassle you...
to do what...? to do what, for chrissake...? to help her to do what? she's dead...
john fitzgerald kennedy.
how embarrassing.  did i hold up three fingers?
no one ever helps me. it's my job.
mammoth.
well, i don't know what you gonna do about it, because i don't hear no riot an' i don't see no riot, an' what's more i don't believe they *is* no riot.  look for yourself.
i will, mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems i've been wrong about that.
i'm sorry, officer.
what you figger to do?
not without claudia. where is she?
weil great. you can watch tv upstairs.
never mind.
uh huh, i've been trying to get out to hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, i haven't gotten there yet.  all right, open your eyes.
where's luh?
she wanted to cook me breakfast.
maybe she don't know. although i don't see how that could be. maybe she didn't want to upset you -
yeah?
yes?
another martini, paul?
c'mere, doctor.
this cell is like a huge library. it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. almost like it was...engineered.
castlebeck.
i'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. give me a month and i'll blow their movement wide open.
no, thanks.
where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what?
i saw the longing in your eye --
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  and another for you?
four days?
i'm sure.
that's all?  that's enough!  she was a beautiful little girl.
she doesn't know -- and she never will.
was your family traveling with you?
me.
you're right.  so why take a chance--
i didn't want to kill, but i had to. i heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
hell no.
no! no!
hi.
why don't you get another one? why don't , you get another job?
i am. what do you want?
yeah, but they leave you plenty.
a good deal, like this with us, for burnett will be good only temporarily.  he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  life is dust, make it while you can.  he's ambitious.
hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
freshman and sophomores...
there's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  i've already been workin' on a young fellow from chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to biarritz for a good time. likes a little game of bridge and poker.
jim.  what's yours?
why?
signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
yes. i liked louise very much. she was his maid.
oh, that's hilarious. they're back from fire island. they're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what i mean?
where?
lecter said a lot of things.
but it's not on the schedule!
no.
yes, it does. the sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
it's based on the life of doctor martin luther king.
of course. i remember everything from your class.
was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
guess again, copper.
nothing...hey michael...you know i was thinking about yesterday.  maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
yeah... oh, uh, and i'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
sorry. i’m a little nervous. i never thought something like this would happen to me.
yes, i suppose so.
no, don't be silly. what-what do we need other people for?  you know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
aren't we full of ourselves today?  i think it's because of the lion.
look, i'm doing mute 'till i have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
i... i can't!
i gotta meet natalie for dinner.
mr. kringelein -- how you have changed, you look so nice.
hey, toyota. he asked me a question.
samuel. samuel lapp.  but what happened here is none of his affair. my sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
i'm a college girl. two days a week, tuesdays and thursdays, i go to college.
oh yes? you always know everything.
i hope not.

she says that ali is still in the casbah.
so who are you?
any of it. if it can be welded i can weld it.
how would he avoid it... as if i needed to ask?
it's not like i'm some modern punk dickhead... it's obviously supposed to be a 1977 punk look, but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it!
that's fair enough.
they never found dad's body--maybe somehow--
why don't we just cut through the woods?
i'm completely serious.  there is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  you know what that is?
keep trying!
that staggering. his dying so quickly.  in your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
thank you.  but the truth is, i'm a single woman in a man's world. that leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
new lives begin!

there wasn't any plane.
do they, m'dear?
what is this? where's reed?
yeah, i thought about that as i was driving... and... i haven't found somebody in my world.  you found anyone in yours?
that's all there is.
it is not a question of liking, your majesty. your own law decrees it, i'm afraid.
right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready?  who cares?
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
you told me about him. i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him. so you told me.
i've only got one question for you, and i want an honest answer.  have you taken any human victims yet?
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
go on, go on, go on. and we'll be at jim's bar up the street.
hey, listen, i hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
he can hardly talk.
yes, ma'am?
who gives a fuck?  in all the years i never seen you cry.  you loved him.

my dad died.  my dad, my dad.
the safe's a simpson 71.  last time i played the game, simpson only had a 40.
that's something i suppose.
i've done that already. he should appear, you know.  it doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
george, don't be so emotional.  this is business.  besides, i can't kill you, you are my brother.

a mistake?
uh, yeah.  cut to the chase.
no.

it was perfect.
of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  and how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
think we should get up a search party, head in there?
fine lloyd.
pray you be sweet as your words, dear jack.
no, it's for the best, it really is.  we were so wrong for each other.
i'll ask the questions, helmuth.
so you sat it out, that's what you did?
no.

stay under the safety light. help is on its way.
gimme the black guy...
it's the future, isn't it? just like you told scrimm.  i knew you weren't from around here.
well, i'm a little muddled.  the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east.  and there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...

certainly not.
madeleine!!
would you say that again?
three days.
yeah. bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
quit while you're ahead.
that's about the only thing i don't do – that i'm built for. i inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. sometimes i tend bar and act as bouncer.
where are you right now?
so?
that was exciting!
yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
you know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
south dakota...  did i do something unsatisfactory, sir?

i need that voucher! i told you a week ago it was important!

the man downstairs said number--

she's having a baby. twins.
weekly or monthly?
shields, aye.
of course.
watch out for drafts. a draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
i gotta work off some of this adrenaline. i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn. anybody want in?
what are you doing here?
here we go!
but wait, harold, what do you mean?
show him who we are.
believe me, i don't blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
lan's, i'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
yeah.
it's the same questions, mrs. little. since the death of your husband --
i was gonna kill them two by myself. it don't take three.
no thanks, mr. eddy.
well, then what are you doing here?
the doctor will give you something.
pretend.

other people can't.
sure.
i don't like you working with wendy. why are you working with wendy?
i'm still better than you. nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
a dress.
i'm sorry about steve, not myself. i'm even sorry for my brother.  to be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
it's not that big a deal.  we just didn't hit it off.
the job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
lunch?
no. never.
it still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
no, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
see, that's the problem with terrorists.  they're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
i've got to find scully.
you humans are very curious to us. you invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  you lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... you give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  you aspire to very high ideals here.
ma's shore gonna like it here. she ain't been treated decent for a long time.
the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but i think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
i worked vice, narcotics... violent crimes... and i saw every known depravity.  i was lost, mace.  in outer darkness.  then i busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. when i met faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  another lost soul.
i... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  to his appearance.
jump!
do you have to ask?
mrs. caldwell i think you're misunderstanding something.
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  we were saved from starvation by the lupi-loopo indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
oh... can i help you?
how do you stay so positive?
whose toe was it, walter?
all right.  all right. i'm taking a break at four o'clock. if you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.

i want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "benny's world of blood."
i don't want to hear it.
shit! look at this mess!
it's never happening again. right?
why?
no, i don't.
yeah.
you are an animal.
it's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, mr. holland.  the insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  the patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. that nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
turn on the light.
goodbye, father.  i am sorry.
yeah.  you could say that.
oh no, no, no.  no can do.  you enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and i don't care if it's a styrofoam cup or the exxon valdez!  you've got to learn to take responsibility!
did she actually say she'd go out with you?
is it--?

i'm sure.
everything can be killed.
either fight the way things are or accept it.

but they all got it back again, didn't they?  we should have lunch sometime.
i seen the angel of death ned, an' i seen the river.  he's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a buick.
all right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
then what happened?
thanks, young man. you've got a heart of gold.
his dream?  you can't control your dreams.  and you can't control your fears, can you?
i don't want you talking to jerry.
i know! starbucks! i served you an espresso at starbucks.
they're paramedics.  they wait at 180 feet.
do you really think so?
one week -- i'll see to it, sir.

never better.
i was an officer.
dave?
it's always politics.  like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  but i could pay you more not to.  see what i mean?  i could write you a check right now--
you and i, niki, have very different ideas about sex.
get out of my way.
look, i just want out of this nightmare. i don't know these guys. a few days ago i'm in paris picking pockets and now i'm america's most wanted.
i want to be the best i can.
this is kind of a stream--
it was an accident.
alright, get in the car before i have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
what's a ditty again?
shit! temp's dropping! we should have left this rock an hour ago!
i don't know about you, but i feed off my emotions.
keep talking, there won't be a next time.
one drop?
lie down, please.
what?
look at me.
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
believe in penny priddy?
name?

let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
that's 'cause i sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, i sticked my *own* knife in there. i poked it all around, i just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
we been down this road.  i told you how it is.  unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano.

no. he was. i got him out.
we invested in these factories. in vancouver.
what are you talking about?
you need five years training to handle a joint like...
boy, i bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
yes.  this kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do!
i don't know why i said that. she's not dead at all.
... but it won't cover annabelle daniels's medical bills.
commandeer.  we're going to commandeer a ship.  nautical term.
more than all right. miss bodwin, she teach me stuff..book stuff. she says i might go to oberlin. she's experimenting on me.
one day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. the first saint of our century. that's a prayer, too. a catechism. something the priests tell us to believe.
danny!!!
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
no. i'm gonna wait.
you're not hearing me here --
haven't seen her - not since we got back.
that's what i told her. if she could just see him a second, then i could take her home.

i've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
"with you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
sometimes i think all men are fools!...
good. for a second there i thought we were in trouble.
you really are a pirate.
i was just sitting here -- it happened. i had nothing to do with it.
i'd rather not, mrs. robinson.
gorman!  give it a rest would you.
yes.
james, you said he was hiding in the barn...
physical?
right, now i need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
obvious?  why don't you and i have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
wrong number.
you've got a lot to lean about homicide, jeff. morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
i thought you were watching him.
y-y-yes--
no. that's all. you made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
it's john who's the target now.  you have to protect him.  he's wide open.

3jane's the only person beside tessier that knows the code.
no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.

then where's it coming from?
i'll talk to her, and to dad, too.  a few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
i don't want to hurt you, catwoman. yet.  after tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. i won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. i warn you, don't tempt captain god when he is angry. let is complete our mission in peace.
did we do it? did we make a difference?
do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing mecca?
okay, great, grunick -- easy shots now -- huh?  good night.
and he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great admirer of your work..."
they could have been put away. anderton could have found them.
probably. fuck that, i'll sneak in. i need some female vagina tonight.
yes.  i suppose it's possible.
it was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
and then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
oh, ellie, look.  they're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
hell, yes!  what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler?
we better watch him. he's crazy.
what did you say?
i beg your pardon?
yes, mr. fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  oh - zowie! i'll give her the message. 
did teddy send you?
asshole probably got lost.
you're exaggerating!
you don't make anything. it's for exercising.
that's just part of being a woman. diet and exercise should help. avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
if you want seconds, then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
why do you say that?
but you can breathe it.
no, sir! it was the hardest thing i ever did, sir! until this.

he might have been wiped out by a plague. natural catastrophe. like a fiery storm of meteors. from the looks of this part of your planet, i'd say that was a fair bet.
where you from?
yes i have - so bad i wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
all right!  i'm thinking!  "let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove."
you threw it in a trash barrel?
hey, captain god!
come on, walter!.
she wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
yeah, that's him.  buddy says glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
why's that necessary all of a sudden?
no, sir.
carl said he didn't like kabuo much anymore.
that's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. then grasp firmly. the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
came here for a wedding, ethan... until that's over, i reckon 'reverend' will do...
i was hoping you'd say that.
you'd never know it.
right. 
who, jesse?
yeah, you already said that.
i was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. they were hiding him!
that's the way it came out.  let me ask you one question.  have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
then go.
ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
i never knew.
what about the intro?
he's the wrong man.
according to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...marcus halberstam.
you give me more credit than i deserve. of course, i'm tempted. who wouldn't be?  but some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. i'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. obviously, some of us haven't.
we got to head them off, right at the start. push them around first.
you can't talk to it?
you're not going to get in trouble. you're going to find out who you are. finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
katherine.
granville?
better start gettin' into your clothes.
god willing.
does he speak english?
what is this "you say"?  a deal kicks out...i got to eat.  shit, williamson, shit.  you...moss... roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? who's up there?
now. now! i have to go now. i have to see the frozen charles! now! tonight!
he cribbed that from borges.
yes.
no bother. i'm very grateful for a little company. you see, i suffer from insomnia.
can you live with it?
are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
i'm sorry.
what's wrong?
no.
roast tom turkey. gee, i'm hungry too --
that's none of your bussiness. i have been a good worker, a good and loyal worker for you, you fucking asshole.
yo' know i iz the best man here! yo' said so yoself!
no i do, captain howdy said no.
listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. you come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
where's june today?
what?
yeah? which terminal?
only if you'll tell me who he is.
excuse me?
i understand the risks involved here. but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid 6.7 than barnes. and, there is nobody who knows him better than you. if a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. i have complete confidence in you.
i know of no better time.
told you what?
i'll leave. but look at me. look at my face, jackie. i'm not lying. i met you and your mother. i told you then that i'd lost my memory. [beat] there was no one for miles around so i know you know there's no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
people talk to winston. he's street, same as them, they trust him. they get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. i thought i might drop in on him. he'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
you're sitting on your ticket.
mrs. sutphin?
do you know who this is?
rico. rico rizzo.
i'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
you bet i will. and when i tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  you fink!
fuckin-a.
i can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... i'm on my way. is there anything more you've thought of-?
hi.
close.  billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.
are you a rotten liar.
sure.
not at all.  you look very -- dashing.  here, you pick one.
i ride around nights mostly. subways, buses. see things. figur'd i might as well get paid for it.
i know.
aww, you ain't that bad. you just need a little flava. first thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
dr. juttson, please take kelly back to camp right away.  leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
that's right, sir -- i come from new orleans -- i was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. we specialize in sauces; my whole family. it's what we do. i was supposed to go to paris and study at the escoffier school; i was saving the money. they called me for my physical so i figured the navy had better food.
it's happening tomorrow morning. get back here now.
as usual. everything as usual, mr. farmer. just give me my due.
a ticking bomb...
because he's dying.
thank you.
all the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. after a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
i know.  i'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. if you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. and bring the sheila 3.2 character module with you...
anything wrong?
still sleeping.
meaning the duck himself, i guess.
it was part of the treatment i intended...i didn't know what the effects would be...
he made me laugh.
you've been cheating on me haven't you?
he ever accept cash for a favor?
current version.  for ten years he's been imprisoned as freddy by the story of nightmare on elm street.  but now that the films have stopped-  the genie's out of the bottle, heather, that's what the nightmares are about. that's what i'm writing.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. you declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
nobody else is going to know it was us.
oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. i wish i'd known...
i’m sorry. it’s just you don’t look local...
beautiful?
i don't know.
snow shelter.  okay.  you dig. i'll have a little sit-down.
i might have to look into that...
yes.  i'm not out of shape.
huh? oh, good, good.
you're right.  at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  smile.
let's check out the scene.
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for williams' capture.
on the contrary.  he wants to see your ratings soar.  he needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
fifteen years ago?  it won't wash, pumpkin. no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. i wasn't born yesterday, you know.
competence.
i wanna know your thinking, i wanna know how someone like you thinks. did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? maybe that's your idea of being anti establishment!
make it yourself, or is it real?
are you afraid of me?
no buts. i told you your friends were jackasses.
you're hurting me.
okay.
it's okay. mr. bixler, i finished all the books for summer reading.
gimme a break!  coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  trust me... they're not speaking russian.
aye. then we'll leave her be.
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. grief, loss, remorse...
i have to talk to you.
yes, but the curtains were drawn.
what're you, nuts?
all right. now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make. it is my dear wife's belief, which i accept although i do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. you will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear rosebud, in love and harmony. do you understand me?
what's your name?
tom, the welsh dude --
i'm not. i don't know what my name is. i don't know who i am!!
must have opened while i was away at school.
the universe is a living creature, like you and me, madmartigan.
just...take it easy, gerry.
let me just clarify a few things.  i don't care what kind of cop you are in china, you have no jurisdiction in america.  without me you are just another tourist.
just in case they don't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
maybe... look -- just...
barks an argument and shakes his head.
look over there. two women fucking a polar bear.
what's wrong with him?
yes. those are our own people. they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. it is much too hazardous.
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters.
right now, i'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
"superintendent j. mckechnie, vancouver police department. vancouver b.c. replaying to your e.p. teletype classification no. 2684 incomplete.  we advise identification possible.  elizabeth kinsolving, arrested greenwater, north carolina, january 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  signed, fbi., washington, d.c. h. cleary, inspector in charge."  have ye any comment, killaine?
do what? what'd you do?
then relax.  it's a federal bank. guaranteed by the government.  and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles.  no questions.  no problems. all the pesados keep their money here. even el padrino.  what do you worry? everyone knows we are with escobar.  who is going to fuck with us?
did you close the door?
no, i'm going to answer you.  you want an answer?  i'll give it to you.  loyalty.  she was loyal.  everything grew from there.
what?
he's firing through his cloak. we can't get a lock.
let me out. stop the car.
yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
really... i mean it.  have you been going to your groups?
yeah.  i heard you.
yes.
you know what?
this is madness!
it's arright ...
then don't come.
we really should get together sometime soon... i-i'll definitely call you this week --
all right -- i promise.
bullshit.
we got about forty bucks, sweetheart. that'd get us to el paso.
well, no shit, sherlock
where?
benjamin, is this your first time?
gimme a break, mr. russo.  i'm in show business.
i said i like all of them.
are you alright, young man?
how can anyone be that naive?
great!
funny job.
why do you think she did it?
white light.  pain.  like being ripped inside out... slowly.  like being born, maybe.
come, come, sir.  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
'fish'?
only two ways i know to leave here early.  one is to escape.
mr. cedar!
it's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
nobody knows anything, believe me.
i'm not myself since i stopped smoking.
i have heard that story but i do not believe it.
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all i care.
i thought you were above all that
let's synchronize the watches. eleven forty-two, sharp.
then, forget it. besides, i have an early class tomorrow.
i got family. ...please.
it's about time.
i sunk most of what i had into this condo, which devalued, and --
okay.  okay.
i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum, is that right ?
helsinki, which is the capital of finland.
you look good, man.
come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
darling, may i have this one?
you know we're right.
how to kiss ass.
i'm scared.  what is it?
do you have cause to bothering us?
i-i'm sorry, sam.
well hurry up. i want to be at mrs. rosemond's before lunch.
i'm fine.  come on, beth!  you know i'm fine!  how the hell long do i have to keep doing this?
i need to get my goddamn head examined.  you can't rule something out on a whim. or because she's cute. i've been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now i'm tired! me!
he wants to kill you, you know... perhaps i won't allow it.
what i am talking about is moderation.
here, use mine.
be back in a minute. if stan calls you, just tell him i went to embers. oh, geez -
it does not come off as easily as the young ones.
i'm not sad, no, i owe the captain my life. it's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. it's a lot more fun to punish crime. then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a warrior for. you just want the kicks. the rush.
so they said more than the address.
yes.
citizen lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  we do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
sure, i'll take her up right now.
uh, what?
his car's still there.
yes.
you're not venturing alone, surely.
...yes she did.
everything was different.
what?
you're wrong.
no.
yeah.
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo?
our own special bus.
it's new.
oh yeah. you two fuckin' micks know what's going on, huh?  fuck you!
dotty -- this is not "guy.". this is a "syndrome."  it's called early midlife, about-to-marry, hanging onto the-bottom-rung dear- god-don't-let-me-be-alone, i'll- call-my-newly long-suffering- assistant-without medical-for- company syndrome.  and if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
you proposing what i think you're proposing?  don't you think i'm a little young for you?
i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.
those white things have taken all i had or dreamed. i'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..they just don't know when to stop.
where do you send them?
this. i can't tell you how sorry i am!
what, you think i'm made of money?
and the last one is the...
do you intend to marry, my lord?
it just slipped your mind.
no, stay in the car.  i want you to understand something.  if i intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
i'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  what a nightmare.
it would seem.
surprise.
who wards off demons.
maybe.
do you miss frederick?
think, think. try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
yes, of course. the hash browns are delicious. i'm just...not... ordering them.
yeah, the fucking lawyer.
scientific american?  really?
you spotted them, huh?
you're welcome. well -- i'll see you later, mrs. robinson.
bullshit --
feel free to correct him if you want.
your majesty --
try and live a lifetime before friday. cram it all in. 
i am sent by god, and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment. or do you think that you are better judges than he is?
enough!
what about you?
no, fuck you.  and fuck him too. fuck the both-of you.
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both.
i'll go...
best friend?
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
long ago.
some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
is it pretty?
i own the house. me, giuseppe martini. i own my own house. no more we live like pigs in thisa potter's field. hurry, maria.
we're dealing with tracy and hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  we must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
what of? look, i wouldn't do it unless i was. i'm dead lucky 'cos i get paid for doing something i love doing.
you know how beautiful she was?   her husband left her, and he took her kids .... they, they, they'd let you die in there.  they don't care.  nobody cares.  the patriot home, the chronic care ... in arlington ...?  they'd take her in.  perpetual care.  they'd take her.  fifty thousand dollars they want.  an endowment.
... tired.  must... lie down.
tell me the answer to this! what bird lays eggs in a barn?
i drink.
i'll be another!
int. brynner's van - day.
yeah, well, if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
mu-shu?  you're hungry?
i don't think i can afford it. i don't want my dad paying.
no, maybe not though. that, that's what i'm trying to say.
that's natchez-under-the-hill.
so, blocker, what do you think of our boy?
fuck you, i'm gone!
man! our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! you french women work quick!
what's he look like?
this is your last chance. tell us everything you know.
marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  that's motive. she admits to being there the night of his death.  that's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
we forgot to stop at the store.
nooo!
oh, god, no!
would you shut the fuck up?  who the fuck is in the bathroom?
i have a son of my own. about you boy's age. i can imagine how painful this must be for you. but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em. you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
he's got that kinda money?
what do you mean, ross?
what do you mean?
whoa, whoa!!  think it through!  i'm the only one knows where they are. just let me talk for a second.
i have already heard about this cafe, and also about mr. rick himself.
block e?
doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? where will we get them?
no. frank was a good bloke.
she'll wait.
later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!
what did you say?
yeah, i always wanted to watch you eat.
lucky pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
blue. that doesn't hurt nobody. yellow neither.
you mentioned information.
what?
-- how did you get here?
he wants me to break a leg?
forced what?
you sure?  a coke or a perrier or something?
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault's price. i get it for them for half. is that so parasitic?
uh-uh. don't tell us, jam. just show us.
nope.
it's mister marion.
my child, you're alive!
thanks...
there's got to be an explanation. it could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  who knows?  i don't know, i think it's kind of interesting.
just electra?
you take a lot for granted.
i'm done drinking. that's it. just church and grocery stores. nothin' else.
he tapped that.
so tracy?
maybe we can reason with jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
you're under arrest. incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
no.
yes, you should.
how badly do you want that money?! how bad do you want to stay out of jail?
 that's why i didn't give it...
and if he alters it...?						*
you do. and once i'm out of here, i'll remind you of the best parts.
that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas, you actually wear it.  i'm touched.  sit down, sit down, what brings you to mombassa?
what are you talking about?
did you hear, father? he didn't mean it when he said i was beautiful.
could you believe that fire? man! first day! there i was, adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! i love it here -- no surround and drown for this company. fighting 17th! goddamn stephen's amazing. you see how he took that fire by the balls? i'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
yeah, first and second.
you're a fucking nut. you know that, merle? you're a fucking maniac!
i thought you wanted to.
like i wanted to talk to you. i didn't need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
will you shut up already?
yeah... and still in messina.  he's my uncle.
listen, listen -- i can speak --
don't think i'll need it where i'm going.
do they have pressure?
... i would love to start looking at least.  you know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in brooklyn or staten island...
do you want me to see what's on them?
his face.
some little kid stole the hubcaps.
oh, cole, please. please come out of it. what would i do without you?
you don't know that for sure.
oddly enough, i do.
i hope it brings you luck.
they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
got the number of the motel out on the old highway? bates, i think. 
risa, i serviced that bus.  at the garage.  there's nothing wrong with it.
dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on saturday night.
stay low.
to be sure, captain.
so this is temporary for you?
quantum is up thirty-five.
no! oh god.
shit...
i told you, he isn't here.
i would have been laughed right out of xenia.
no.
i wish he had a family, though.
if it comes to that, i'll do us both.  let's see that it doesn't here, i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
too bad.  because i'm terrible at 'yes.'
talk to him. you speak shellfish!  hey, look... put it in the pot.
never heard of the place.
fifteen lousy bucks.
black...
thanks, but i've got to be going. unfortunately, doc, this isn't a social visit.
check.
i'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
you asshole.
oskar.
up there! i would put it up there!
it's right here.  this region; an-nagaf. i got recon photos.  there're no troops there, no fighting--
annette! annette!
you can say that again. what do we do?
yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  that's top priority.
no!  no!  we don't make love.  go to work.
yes, master.  are you sure you want to go through with it?
i love you too.
strategically.
dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? what's wrong jen, see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
mineral baths - now really!
they don't believe me.
change my name.
you're damned right they are.
they're harder to do than they look.
whatta you mean, whose point of view; the audience's point of view.
man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
yes, i've seen it before.
waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... two years ago, his annotated dictionary of cuisine, by alexander dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. seller's affidavit of ownership, signed cary panz.  p.a.n.z.  sounds to me like an orderly.  whadja clear on the book? ten, twelve grand?
no.
no, thanks.
look, i'll call harvey tomes in the psych department, see what i can find out.
when was i in here?
no.
animal! got a little something for you!
jack...
it's a week.  we didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
no. i couldn't.
a moment.
huh?  oh... yeah.  s'okay?  uhm... how're... business things going.
got my hands full here.
just some buddies.
it's an easy category. movie trivia.
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
yes i know, it runs in the family.  new book?
no... sharp -- you look great.
what?
you stuff sausage in it.
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
it's for the party, dad --
try cates.  and let's talk in private, okay?
'laura scudder's peanut butter'.  you like it?
jerry lee lewis, elvis, dinky doo and the don't's.  let's book, charlie.  if he starts on motown, we'll be here all night.
i don't understand --
it's against my nature.
that doesn't help anything, bill.
-- small.
graham.
yes.
take a deep breath and count to ten. it's not that kind of work. you're lily, right?
he has all of superman's powers. if i've planned it right. . .
i'm afraid. i'm afraid if paulie finds out.
join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? thank you anyway.  and i like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
they're coming.
why bring it here?
twelve young, answer the radio. i have a call for you.
in a minute...
no, it was so right it scares me.
man, why're you talkin' about larry?  his business is his business.
oh, brother.
no, not really.
sergeant lucas.  may i come in?
that's impossible. i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
we have a search warrant, mr. wigand. there's been a death threat.
who told you this, majesty?
been years since i fooled with that.  you know a white girl? dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
there's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
but how do you know?
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
thanks to me.
boy, i hope so, buckaroo banzai.
we have a good many connections in england, naturally.
good.
yeah?
no, you don't understand.  it's been wonderful meeting you.  but... i have a husband.  i have two kids at camp.  i have a life i have to go back to.
this... is my new home?
it must be up in your old room.  i will look.
don't belong?
with ordell?
you're not going unless your sister goes.  end of story.
you ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, duke?
because it's wreckable. i took another look and i changed my mind.
i could have struck off his head just now!
and you still believe he's going to come here?
i think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
and what does <u>that</u> mean?
isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
oh, i'm very grateful.
one reason... i want to stay the only one left alive.
bye.
you weren't at my game.
think i left something back at the -
er, my check, please.
if you want to see me you will not do this. you will make an appointment...
listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may as well pay my rent.
right now -- i'm at the epitome of my life. right now i feel so good i'm afraid something's gonna happen.
you could get your wish at any moment.
mr. lime's.  accident...
you know how much it is, nick.
okay. i'm sorry.
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
you're welcome. rose.
how are molly and the boy?
tommy, i promised the babysitter six o'clock.
nothing.  everything's great. terrific.
arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
that's my job. i'll take care of that. i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
you don't act like the rest of gideon's friends. they believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
they're waitin' for me, that's why.
your what?
i don't need proof.  i know it.  send it out.
yeah.  some college student who's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime.
sure, ma.
ty and larry fuck with that shit, not me.
no, laddie.  it was a <u>memory</u>.
they are gone, louis. death took them. death which you can now destroy...
he tried to rob me -- he is dead --
my pleasure, al... always happy to help out in a pinch...  excuse me. i better call my service... tell them where i am.
--what happened to the goddamn "witch-watch??"
you have nothing to fear.  you're safe again.
i saw you fight kid gavilan.  i like your style.
what?
--that is a wild boast. you lack a knight's humility.
why, what's gonna happen?
how's that, quince?
thank you.
can you make it back?
you serious?
a new player.  he's using the name nicholai.
laura palmer, you're just too adorable.
oh, that's nice.
i just want you to like me.
i lead maggie through a visualization exercise.  all the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
you don't have a shred of evidence!
no, really, i can cope.  i can handle this lot easily!
business keeps you on the road?
i'm playing to win.
booze we don't need. why don't you join us, baxter? we got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from bellevue.
i think you'd feel out of place at my party.  you see, it's for winners.
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago.
when we fall, we fall hard.
i'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so i can't make any promises.  well, thanks again for dinner. thank your mom again for me, will you?
well--that's very fine.  saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
put them down!  please make them put them down.
you just want to ask me questions?
who's askin'?
what do ya want the others to get?
you would? wow. when would we come?  'think he hung up.
--turn the camera off--
mister señor love daddy, i'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, tina.
why?
enchanté.  alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, i'd worry.
why not?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
what did you think of him?
well, uh... no.
i'd be dead by now if that were the case.
those aren't jews.
that's a fact. what you do, boy?
and what do you propose, professor? shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
thank you very much, hal.
so, this could be your last night, huh?
it's too late.  argon injected it.
my dad plays for the "clippers."  he says i'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but i'ma play for them, too.  same number and everything.
...like fried and chicken...
you think i'm fucking around here? mark it zero!!
the big job.
amy, i'm not going to let anything happen to us.
but isn't fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
it's his life insurance money, you know.
no
yes.
i don't know. i haven't decided yet.
i thought you said 'be sorry for nothing'.
what's this?
look, enough of this "mr white" shit -
how would you like to be yourself for the day?
jill.
that's it. i'm gonna have to tell my little brother, i'm gonna die. i can't make him his lunches anymore.
nature ...
how far is baker? i was hoping to stop there for lunch.
huh? sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  we're still on for tonight, right?
there's a vague similarity.
i didn't want a piece of yours, i wanted my own.
it's ok.  it's ok.
in the knee?
we don't get to talk much any more.
-- let me do this, okay? --
hm.
i wish i could say the same for myself. i was up thinking about you all night.
come on, it's too late now...
i agree.
must've needed it.
oh. it means that santa's gonna fuck hanukkah's shit up.
now, just a minute—you can't—
well... this rock rotates every two hours.  the sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
please, get on the bus...
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren.
as fast as i can.
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait don't tell me ... naked sexual charisma?
i don't want to.  i want to swing....
yeah, dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
well why not?  i gotta make statues leonard.  you heard maxwell, they want me to make them.  i can't go back to being a busboy!
hi, auggie.
why not?
he drives a carriage.
take them.
 yeah.
anytime.
of course.
yes ma..
oh don't be silly.  death is nothing to be scared of.  it's just another way of living.  it's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army -- and the police?
where is africa, miss johnson?
but what about you and the baby? you need me.
a pre-wedding luau?
now wait a minute!
sheet.  did you bring ze mirror?
yeah--
don't do this.
what?
no pain, no gain?
and on a day of mourning. i never met the fellow but once at your house.
that's right.
i know who you are, el americano. mister george.
you can't tell your parents.
i know you're not calling jimmy.
no, i'm not proud of myself... but we don't have the luxury of choice.
oh, leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
hey. what's up?
uh, we didn't score yet.
what if they do question the authenticity?
what?
dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  i mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
it wouldn't happen to be this...
what time?
there was a gun.  who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
we don't have rooms, bob. we have cells.
why did you agree to come here?
isn't that my drink?
anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. i've felt it myself.
i'm not... easy.
look, we'll do our trip as soon as i get back.
ok, so who was it, then?
can i have an evil twin?
came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  told you you would.
oh yes, power and light. thank you.
tú! traidor a tu gente! rompehuelga! desgraciado!
they're moving apart.
for the third time.
it's not true.  you have to believe me.
let us explore it together.
oh yes you will wear garters—
sir, i ain't feeling so chipper on account of wade.
can i ask you something?  didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  so what changed?
it's, it's really nice, paul.
that's right!
brilliantly moving.
you did?  wow, sorry about that.  listen, mario's a little not so bright.  he seems to think that you said --
well - well we haven't quite received my father's consent, your majesty. not entirely. not altogether.
i'm sorry.
no. keep all energy to the armor.
he likes her better than me.
yes. she had a husband and a son.
you're going to hold me up at a time like this?
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
what is it?
maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
it's not working.
i did. isn't it neat-o?
take your hand off my shoulder right now.
no, you're not.  what kind of talk is that...
<u>that's</u> the spirit...
i just told you, he's a big, hairy...
what do you mean about caring?  have you ever seen one of those places? inside? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  why? has she harmed you? she's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
she's a catholic. she says it would put her soul in peril. divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
wouldn't we all.
<u>yes</u>...
i see.
is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
yes.
we had a team at the 325th evac last fall. i coached the boys myself.
who's asking?
who?
perfectionist.
abattoir. huh. but you are going to get the good news this week about your book. i know you are. i can feel it.
why, sure -- i got it!  do you have a match?
yes, i know what they make it out of, so what?  it's food now.  <u>you're</u> eating it.
i was afraid of that.
we're going to get my little girl.
don't take too long. we're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  mr. sulu, impulse climb.
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl's well was carl's own spare.  even though it was too large f...
perry?
of course. i would like to look.
hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
you're not buying a car, for christ sake.  you're having your wife killed.  i'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  it's thirteen, or it's nothing.
no, that is not belief.  that is desperation.
-- until yesterday morning.
i'm glad. hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you've been asking yourself. now, we're gonna have a little q and a, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  want a chesterfield?
i didn't make you. you thought it best.  but, look, i take full responsibility.
just a dream.  you should sleep too.  you're still not well.
okay... about this whistle-blower... did mike and don go along with the corporate decision?
lieutenant.
i know.
then if you don't mind...  i'm gonna pass out.
well, then, how about a cup of coffee, darlene?
mr. sulu... take us home...
yeah.  i hope you don't mind.  i didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides harry.  and me.
listen, did you want to make love?
we got a cookaboo inside.  he wounded some kid earlier.
oh, andy, andy!
fine.  but they'll have to take care of themselves.
of course.
we don't know that for sure.
where's wong?
a leader, like laszlo?
yeah? you know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
out of the room.
then, what <u>are</u> we, drew?! the <u>winners</u>? "ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel..." excuse me, i'm not your lover. i'm your care partner. fuck!
when were the sacred scrolls written?
you're hurting my arm.
give my blessing to the girl. she needs a spare.
where?
know the millertown bluff?
we didn't talk. we never talked.
tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  kids.  kids. kids!  i love them.
i don't know if i can.  but you have this... and you know where to come.
where are we?
all right!  she's alive.  i believe it.  but we gotta get moving!  now!
someone looking after her little girl?
are you all right?  you coming down with something?
an animal that doesn't procreate. it spreads, grows. a living disease.
but that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to leslie.  i've told you that a million times...
that i am very little different from him.
what's that, son?
what would she do that made it hard to resist?
oh, you... you're very popular, i can see.
everybody shut up.
i see...
try "old" on for size.
i see.  let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  now you think they don't exist?
how?  the transmitter was on the apc.  it's wasted.
here, have this can of campbell's tomato soup.
i heard.
i can breathe withour pain now, so i guess i feel great.
do you think it's wide enough?  how much?
i'm askin' ya to go to him -- as a favor.
what?
--how do you know about that?
what are ya talkin' about?!  i was the one saying i didn't believe it!
well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
i don't even tell them about anything i'm close on anymore...
well, i mean, why not?  you know, wh-what have i got to lose?  uh...
i've gotta go in.
like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. people only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
the minute the story broke i bundled her on the first concord out of here. if paris goes kablooey i want the best reporter i've got right there in the middle of it.
well, i wasn't always impotent.
it's been customized for sleeping capacity.
no, i done my time an' got out. come on in. 
probably.
it belongs to the man you took it from.  or should i saw <u>stole</u> it from?
i can't wait to meet her.
shut up.
you just did.
whose ratings were higher?
you have it...
of course. hi, junie --
because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
superman gets mail here?
were all these people questioned this afternoon?
got it. puppies.
and what happend to ...?
hook's on 24...
an honest living.
no!!!
i don't see what else you can do, charles.  if he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
no... no, i don't think that's necessarily true.
i heard a strange sound...
okay.
how old are you?
only if i want something bad enough.
i don't know! i can't see them from here, joel! just pick something good.
who?
no cigarettes.
certainly. right over there.
i want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
oh,--we're doing about thirty--
i must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
what!  say, listen you!  when you get back to new york, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
what a smart kid you are!  okay, eat.
gifts?
i'm cute, too.
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
sssh. don't. don't, please.
i'll never forget this.
everyone's invited, of course.
'sucking off.'
that's why she kills children.
what building?
incestuous.
i want to talk to you for a second.
she was right behind me, i turn around, she's gone. she could be anywhere.
dentonvale has been sold.
oh, she's really enjoying it.  i think. is mac okay?
oh, he's fine! i just heard from him. he's bombing all these places...
the cops are non-negotiable, ippolito.  why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
the question is, what happened to freddy's body?
i don't know why i'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
i'm gonna call the police then, sir.
how would i get a loan, anyway?
separate bathrooms, darling. i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
why do you have to see him?
hello, lisa. i'm trent. what a lovely makeup job.
do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
close, but no cigar.
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? i mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
some of them...
gee i hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
oh, this is andy --
when your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... ignore him.
of course.
if you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
what?
mmm.hmm.
yeah.
you have heard your answer, monsieur le marquis. 
santa claus.
what?
nice work.  maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  but i doubt you'll survive that long.
oh my. you mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
don't move.  it won't hurt you.
how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
yes.  you do that.
i am one of those guys.
sandra bullock. you know her?
not very encouraging.
how grand?
they're fools. why don't they let charlie how-come hunt it alone. he's an indian.
so?
then it's going to be 'i killed for sex'... listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. you haven't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
yes?
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
absolutely. i made enough for an army.
it's on the lake right in the middle of seattle.  it rains nine months of the year in seattle.
keep your voice down.
i enjoy it.
about what?
no thank you, eddie.  i'll be alright.
i carried you up to your bed.
positive. hardy, they planned this.
yeah, but that's not the whole story. she got remarried.
two hundred years old.
not yet, i'm afraid.
it was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. suspect zero came to represent every killer dick low had not caught. the idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. for someone like low, there would always be a suspect zero. we couldn't let richard go where that idea was taking him.
that's correct.
i can't believe it. this is too good to be true.
that's bullshit.
it's cold as charity in there! what he do that for? any number'll take him in.
'they won't.'
guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. and in detroit no less. well, take care, chief.
the order of seating at the upper servant's table is arranged personally by the queen herself.
i didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
yes.
that's what i like about you. you think about a man's feelings. i'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
screwball!  you dolt!  i've a mind to change you into a toad.
you've just said you signed it.
you did.  didn't you?
and these cops? what do they get?
takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  is that...?
fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
well, i'm a good teacher. the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. goodbye, fraulein, goodbye, madame! goodbye, sir!
i didn't.
oh god, i don't think so.
who we working for?
it's my fault. i shouldn't have...i didn't think...
what about e.m.s. recombination?
i don't know.
fine, dennis.  soon as i get my money for this week.
oh please. not now.  she wants you to stop seeing what's- her-name. finally. now and forever. do you think that's too much to ask? for a wife of nineteen years.
what?
i don't know...
experience!  right?
you spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. do it ...
now!  seal that tunnel now!
i'm not certain... but i think there's someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur.
but she must know... unless... unless... rose, was there more than one person?
there's a lot more where that came from.  you're not leaving again?
well, in reality it's not that dangerous, bob. it's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
habeas corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
oh. that’d be rhian, a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. she got wise and dumped him months ago...
and a good thing too.
very.
aren't the kids asleep?
listen to yourself.  digitization.  you know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
sorry, comrade ambassador.
of course.
leland...
come on. there's lots of men around here. keep your eyes open.
when it broke, he said one word:  get me ronnie brean.
it's the transponder.
sir, there's dead american kids here. let's say we don't apologize for kent state, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
mind if i join you?
well, christ, if i'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, i wouldn't have bothered. are you going to eat that?
mrs. hillyer, i don't know who he is, i really don't.
who wants to know?  zeus!
he's in the dark room.
her destination was halifax, yeah.
it's what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims.
approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. is this true?
yeah.  well, you're okay?
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
a receiver tuned permanently to the senator's phone.
what do you mean?
i know.
i can't make the tenth.
with gestures, of course.
best beer in the world known to man or god.
no.
no, thank you -- what's your name?
you already have.  now go on.  do it.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. figured you'd know something about that, wade.
well?
i don't know.
my son... my mind...
jesus!  through a window?
don't worry, i don't want to give up any more.
i told the guy i didn't want to talk to...
uni high tigers, sir. don't you remember ? i was captain of the team.
i thought i did.
mine?
what is it?
for a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  who knows?  it sure could have.  i'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
tell you what?
you got me.  afraid of bad news?
i don't know.
i hate that music.
yeah, but i don't give a shit about.  i trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
it tastes like fish.
lucien baines?
what about tomorrow?
oh yeah?
you could have had it done.  you didn't want us there.
yes, i was.
what medical records?
you got it, sir.
how do i know that? how about it, pretzel-man? what's your story?
nowhere...
hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work i go!
all the little kids arrive today. we're not ready to deal with that alone.
you think that caused the accident, risa?  that it brought bad luck? christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  or maybe they're the same thing.
nor you for me.
i've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off?
ok, last night i was weak. it won't happen again. and all that shit i said--it was just because i was stoned. forget it.
pity.  murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  just look at amityville.  he was one of my boys.  didn't have to give that one any lessons. from day one... but i must be off ... i've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
jackie, i'm william starks. i can prove it.
uh huh. you know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? she came home and painted this whole room pink. she was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
in a pasha's harem, majesty. a seraglio.
my philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department... and here we are.
it's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- i'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
homicidal signs. oh, we're gonna change the light in here for karl. i hope you can see to write.
ah, dammit!
we'll get it later.
there is, but it's not that interesting.
it's nice.
can you see anything?
that many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
fight him --
i hear you. i'll stay in touch.
do we need this...?
you do this -- for friendship?
that's what we're here for. come on, frank.
when can i see you?
and when i finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
i'm still here, doc.
i may spill something.
not really to speak of.
well? you meant well?  people always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
i'm in my party mood.
wanna dance?
oh, yeah - - great.
she may try to kill you.
truman used it all the time.
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren?
so reel him in. but we came here to do a job. so let's do it. quickly.
all that money... i mean... did you...?
smart? she'll be arrested!
and you came all the way down here to see me?
so i heard.
"gadget guy?"  while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, i am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
h'm. this appears -- i say appears -- to be properly drawn. but you shall not have this man! a man isn't property! mr. stone is an american citizen, and no american citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
please, hurry...
you'll know me by the time we're through.
what for?
no, no.  just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
hell no!! the house will kill ya!
tell me some true stories about dad.
well, where are you going?
not *me*! joseph paine is the man they ought to be listening to! come on!
once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
what's your story, baby?
show me.
are you sure you parked it there?
nobody reads that stuff anymore.
aw, mom!
not going, jack?
okay, hildy.  well, we can't get any official statement --
he leave you?
shall i answer it?
guess who?
certainly!
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the poles. but i'm sure you'll find work, wladek, a pianist like you.
well.
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.?
i can't! at midnight tonight, he will kill again. it's crazy!
who's my real father, man?
"of the silvery moon,
admiral, i'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
won't you give yourself a rest, john? she's other people to look out for her.
it's possible.
yeah. when it freezes, i guess that means the molecules are not moving. so when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. the molecules have stopped. so it's clean.
i know, it's stupid.
i hope so, commander, for your sake. the emperor is not as forgiving as i am.
it's been so long i don't how long?
it frightens me.
gee, that's an idea, gallagher. that's an idea there. i wonder now...
i told you you're not supposed to come in here.
let's go, sonny.
nothing. i think i twisted my --
okay.
what do you mean?
two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.
i know, this is fucking nuts.
they're not human!
aye.
what do you mean?
okay...
sure.
that's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  who wants to know?
i guess i'd better get it right the first time.
...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny-five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters -- in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and god forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and god forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
my unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
if he's not madison, then where's madison?
somebody make a note.  i want li..., for the broad...what does she like?  lilacs. okay.  a truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  and get something for bob barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
how can he make any trouble for me? i haven't done anything.
aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
i?
it wouldn't be fair to elizabeth.
whatever you need.
oh, now —— now look here ——
you don't want it though.
we'll move them --
forgive me. it is not here. i assumed he had mind-melded with you. it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near.
don't say "we" when you mean "you."
adam, this isn't like you. please come to the office. there must be something we can do.
you can be cocky now, boy. but you won't make it. you won't last. i just feel sorry for josie. i knew it wouldn't work out.
i've never been to bed with anybody!
right. alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, i'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and i'll give you a call back --
klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
no, i'm not...
you're going to miss mexican halloween. the day of the dead.
i'm a bit of a slob myself.
i was going to catch the last half on tv.
it's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
permission to speak candidly, sir?
the colt's still too small.
oh, shit. that was scary. in the middle of the robbery. the manager looks at me. right in the eye. and goes, i'm going to remember you.
i'm leaving you with my friends. i'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa' that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
i didn't just fuck myself! jesus, i'm going to be sick!
you see anybody else here? just between you and me.
whom you address.
we were gonna ... you know ...
how can you think of food at a time like this?
please... i need to sleep...
yeah, i know, they'll hate me immediately.  thank you.
what's wrong?
pleased to meet you, sheriff.
that's the name they gave me.
lions and tigers and bears!
okay, just calm down. it's going to be okay.
that's a -- that's a pretty big slice. who do you think you are, general motors?
i said no. want me to pull rank ?
this is your room, malcolm. i know you'll keep it clean.
what happened to the donut king?
what about eric?
why?  everybody else knows it. paul saw to that.  sometimes i think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
i'm not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers. you're no longer working with the l.a.p.d. i don't even know why you're standing in here right now. by all means i should have you thrown out.
good.  that's real good.
i mean a human investment, rose, we care about you, you matter to us. but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. do you hear me?
tell that to jack vincennes.  to stensland.
it is morning.
gee, i don't think . . .
i ain't a damn liar.
"wickwire, thomas dane"... second run at coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "appropriation liaison office," whatever that is.
the place is a mess.
all poetry was acceptable.  the name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
at least, the cat comes back.
why, i'm surprised, mr. burns. that's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
it's promising, this one.  we're upbeat.
because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
why?
it's not really working out for me here, dad. i was thinking... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home.
i don't think you do.
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
yeah, i remember.
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
jesus, mace!
you can do anything you want. you're his sister.
oh, no, not at all. and then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
it's a white powder that comes in a vial.
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? when will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
carla pestalozzi?  no. definitely not.  you could have posed for the mona= lisa.  sophia loren looks swedish next to you.
i don't say anything. except it was foreseen.
switch nostrils?
define concern.
this is private property, my friend.
we ended in f major?
how old are you?
velma.
...hey, i don't need your charity...
i promise. is that all?
you're in a tent, darling.  you're not at home.  and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
what did you see, chekov?
tell me the truth.  am i a female fog bank?
not in the mood, i guess.
i'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
yeah, i guess. i'm just a little fucked up.
you mean he withdrew...
oh, for heaven's sake.
did you?
that's it.  get out.
you promise to care for her then?
why are you here?
well what do you think, we eloped or something? or we're living in sin and...
lemon or lime?
i'm doing my job, too.  would you give me a... do you think you could call off your dogs for a minute.
there aren't any.  if the filmmakers are happy, simone's happy.  she considers herself an... "instrument".
i came through for you, mom and the butterflies, dad.
why can't we?
then come for dinner.
pups. bitches. from three to twelve months.  trained and untrained ones. white and brown ones. you understand?
are you sure, kenny?
we'll cut him in on the bets we make. and still have enough profit to send ho-jon to college.
...am starting to get jealous. i read in the newspapers about the italian strike and riots in milan.  i hope you weren't...
what'd he say?  where's the hand- off?
of course, i'll be careful.
i told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked asap.
he said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because i was civil.
you just want to get away from daddy and you're using me to do it!
now i am truly embarrassed. forgive me. i should not have asked such a stupid question. i know you are a very important man and...
you mustn't be afraid.
antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. head split open like a melon.
i … her letter came to me by the nurse.
writer, is he?
yes, sir.
the one good lesson he taught me, louis. never drink from the dead.
what about them?
drake hotel, penthouse suite.  never stop worrying.  i figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  also gale's onto something, digging into his background.
counselor?
you know i am.
you pay me to find you bluecoats. there they are.
bump?
hey but joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. the money's with your brother.
aye, sir --
i've got a lot of thinking to do.  'sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
no  you think she's a tweaker?
i'm very confused.
i'm honored.
check this out, he's from russia.
no, no, i'm not done!  i've got reserves!  nadia, please please please.  i'm begging you.
it's a safety room.  if anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
he did run?
no, but it got you interested, didn't it? got you to dig. inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
first, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. especially where custody is involved.  got it?
nods solemnly. gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
i had to get away!  my life was in danger!
i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  i apologize if i appear abrupt.  i am rusty at social graces.  how do you find cairo?  did you visit the pyramids?
then, it's all over?
what are we going to do about it, al?
look, rob.  if great sex was as important as you think it is, and if i was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. and that is my last word on the subject, okay?
oh, hi. look, i'm running a little late, but i'll still...
well, don't do that again!
i can't go through with it, i tell you.
but thanks.  hey, joe, don't get sore about this or anything. you promise?
i think so.
he knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
i don't think so.
why else would he be taking you to the ivy? you've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
how could i? i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
well, i've been thinking...  i didn't realize how much...talent walter actually had.  it would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  dead wrong.
can i come in?
no, actually i feel worse.
where's kurtz? i want to talk to him.
where are you?  i been trying to reach you.
then we both are.
i was hoping i might be your friend.
estes! that's exactly who it is. that old guy knows something. we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
you know who i am.
yes you have. you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
say again?
o.k., o.k., that's enough.
kay!?
what?
billy?  this was on miller's forehead.  any idea what it is?
fuck you.  i wasn't doing anything. you're like the gestapo.
your son, ma'am?  he must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
i did him a favor.  now come on.
harlan.
only you. and the photo lab.
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you?
what's wrong with this one?
looping right! i never swung wild. i was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
you came in there with this attitude...
get it.
no.
nearly four years...
all of 'em.
right.  i know --
what d'you think i mean, kitten? i forgot, that's what i mean.
oh.  um, i'm ed wood!  so, what are you working on now?
it's a <u>joke</u>.  you're a joke.  you're a joke.  you don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  that is the fine limit of your ambitions...
nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
no. fred hates them.
no...
mm.
i'll give you the money!  okay? i'll give you two-fifty.  just . . . just, please.
good. where is reting rinpoche now?
three.
no.
fine.  why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
i dunno, i...
how's that about your being my friend?
yeah, ray, he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines' jet went down last month.
thank you.
she doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
me? four years.
yes.
i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know. just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
why, yes, of course.
i'm sorry alma, i didn't mean to sound so ...
don't fuck with me, beth.
where's your shirt, mueller?
... see you but can't hear. did you... order...?
i hated myself.  i kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a zombie.
he tortures toys -- just for fun.
no!
put it down, walter.
she's as american as apple pie too. have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
yes.
because god loves a winner.
what happened to him? what happened to creasy?
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously.
suicide is a private thing.
confucious says, the way out is through the door. there's a truck. there's your door.
stay cool. just remember to call him "god."
i did.
this is it, kid. this is our chance. when you got a chance, you better take it.
do you see?
i left three messages already.
on the repeater.
did you ask walter to get you a shrink?  barry, did you ask walter to get you a shrink? what's wrong with you? are you ok?
now i think i have upset you. my english perhaps is coarse.
er ... pray tell me why?
you're a drunk and an idiot.
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed.  you realize how rarely they make that ruling?
ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i don't get if i qu -- it's too complicated. i -- besides...
when - when are you coming back?
that's not what i meant. was there someone special?
i know, man.
can you check again?
because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
i know. simultaneously, they shake and zip. claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born. and if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
here it is.  very first copy.
fuck you.
that's fucking great, barry.  we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  fantastic, barry!
who are you?
when should we do this?
i'll rephrase the question.  mr. roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
they're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
she is upstairs.
i've got a little list here. wandering abroad. malicious intent. acting in a suspicious manner. conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. you name it, he's done it.
maybe that's the price, bud, maybe so. it's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
that's what i was gonna ask you.
thanks.  great.  wish me luck.
shhh. slow down, bob. drive natural.
only fry you once.
what was yesterday?
a madman.
what?
the embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  gestating.  then it...  ...then it...emerges.  moults. grows rapidly --
it's starting to let go!
it's compensation, leo, for the marginal life we lead.  sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
you want to go with me?
i'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
no.
you're going to have to get a new one.
believe me, i'm trying to get this over with as fast as i can. but samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
huh?
ah, no. i was.  it's hard to explain. she had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
why's that?  you said over and over and over, tony clifton is not andy kaufman --
she'll get here.
that's pretty weird. is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
is crawford going with you?
it's ichiro.  ich.
negative...they vamped.
what?
deal, but i'm still detective kincaid,ok?
you mustn't talk russian to me.
who?
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
what and?  that's what i got.
can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
that's something a man could do...?
of course he is.
i would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
did the mescaline just kick in? or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig?!
we'd rather not--
good. in a few minutes, you'll meeting dr. brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. you're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
anyone got a card?
sam, if you're not doing anything new year's -- obviously you're not doing anything new year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  does that sound great or what?  i can't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened.
hi.
can i trade in my car and take another?
for two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. the manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, delyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. can you imagine? all you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
she has the gift -- the blood of thorn running through her veins.  michael's mother had it, too.  so for six years i incubated her, prepared her for this night.  michael has served his purpose.  and soon we will have a new progeny.
shhhhh....tony. rest, rest.
we'll *find* one! only throw compromise out of the window--stick to jeff smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. i don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
charlie!  now you're not making sense.
well, i -
i wanted to see you.
i'll be back before you leave.
am i free to go?
you don't believe any of this. you don't think you'll ever die.
is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
...mr. verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
holy shit, yes!
joe doakes? it's quarter to 10...
cowboy.
billy bob's dead. -- we were wrong -- he didn't do anything. i-it's the scarecrow --
notice the israelis: a fundamentally secular society. they no longer need judaism because they have soil. the real jew is a wanderer, a nomad. he has no roots, no attachments. so he "universalizes" everything. he can't hammer a nail, plow a field. he can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. this is his strength....  take the great jewish minds: marx, freud, einstein. what have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. why? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. nothingness without end...
yeah...
not these people!  they are ruthless!
something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
...everybody. mike says, 'pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'that's correct.' mike says, 'pat. have you been in this bar ?' pat says, 'no, but my sister has...'  everyone. buy yourself one too.
you want me to kill 'em.
yeah.
could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
come here.
yeah, but that's not-that's no good. i want the whole thing.
i never seen a turtle.
cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  sting a bit?
government weather. it's got a transmitter aboard.
son.
we saw.
so did i tell ya?  huh?  nothing to worry about.
no.
somebody else is out here.
hi, rob.  it's your mother.
hiyah, john.  john, i want to have a little talk with you.  what's the matter—are you falling? come here.
c!  shit, i'm sorry!
lots of things.
disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
i'm sure they'll notice things missing.
she came to talk to me...
what are you talking about?  where's that bonding strip?!
naw, it's... this guy wants his money.
sam the bookie?  nothing doing!  you're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
really?
you think you can take me now? come on, try.
i do not accept.
what?
are you questioning me?
who the fuck are you, mother teresa?
it *is* not!
oh, c'mon.  we're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  it doesn't mean anything.  it's sanderson!
-- zero isn't interested in your life story.  who gets killed?
i don't know.
i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it's such a shame.
my apologies, governor.
there's nothing here.
we have much to discuss.  tomorrow.
very happily married.
it's always locked.
you're not listening. your heart is not. love is deaf as well as blind.
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
who?
thanks.
my palate's kind of shot, but from what i can tell, i'd dub it pretty damn good.
there's another man--right outside the booth here.  i never saw him before.
because she doesn't know what a hint is.
epilepsy.
give it everything we've got!
in life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  years ago, the hungarians contacted me.  the government wanted me to come home, to be minister of culture.
that is true.
fascinating.
susan, i sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  i ask that you keep in mind that i am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what i want.
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
-- who's married to --
i'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
what's gonna go wrong?!  i take your place for the royal inspection.  bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
she broke my fucking nose!
i opened marlon.  i think it's somebody's taxes.
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? if they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
better known to his friends as the death's-head moth...
i'm asking for real. i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. will you?
fuck me.
it's not west, is it? tell me it's not west.
this is your party.
mine, and they never tip.
i know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
shhh!
i don't remember any arbor day cards from mr. rock 'n' roll detective.
i'm very happy to hear that, private. now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for dr. innis and i'll be feeling okay, too.
i can't. what if it's the wallaces!? we'd get annie in trouble.
i just never thought of you in that...
where'd you grow up?
you're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  here's your ticket.
i'm not this way, you know. not usually. i don't fuss and fret over my children.  when frank died...  you see, he knew the children, he really knew them. he had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. that's a rare talent.
really?  and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you?
too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  hey! when you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
that's true. what are you?
hell of a way to die.
you were in the m- you were in the building.
what are you doing?
no, you're wrong about verger.
bullshit, i ain't goin' anywhere with you!
i'm not going to "do" anything, i promise.  but you need help, james. none of this is what you think it is.
oh, this?—i like privacy when i retire. i'm very delicate in that respect. prying eyes annoy me.  behold the walls of jericho![4] maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. you see, i have no trumpet.  now just to show you my heart's in the right place, i'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
then why are you here, joe?
who won the fight?
sure.  follow me.
oh, i was just going to...
hell no!
but that wasn't johnny's fault.
yeah, but i'm not sure yet.
why?
i'm sure that's the explanation.
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
make it time.
this sexual obsession of yours. have you considered going into therapy yourself?
his horns. he files 'em. to "fit in."
then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
no, it's tom's. splendid, eh?
what are you talking about? he's fine. he's out of the hospital already. the ratings are higher than ever.
let's remember how i got into this. "please, eddie, do this for me. i can't get a break." 
what do you want?
yeah.
what kind of a deal?
i guess he figured it was better.
in seven years jackie's never missed one of tucker's parties. where is she?
nick... nick!!! it's the only chance we've got!
don't move.
childs.
a user?
are you mad at me?
what are you doing? you can’t. i...
hey, look, gimme a break! all i did was answer the door! how's that gonna change history?
-- something horrible...i don't understand --
you're out of time, man.
you are not in a band, barry.  you are not a musician.  and no posters.
can't you please finish your drink?
it's everyone's trick, kevin.  but i did pick it up from you.
yea, art thou there?
just sent 'em through.
i wish.  you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission.
we're not much good at goodbyes, helena.
we don't know. west is dead.
dr. murnau was the bravest of men. he spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  a great loss.
i've felt that way, yeah.
hey...!
you're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. and you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  but it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
yeah. all week long.
garry's missing!
it's a simple question.
you're always your harshest critic.
i was going to buy a slice.
maybe when they call i'll just tell ellie i haven't seen the damn cat around. you know?
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  you seemed as if you liked to talk.  i like to let people talk who like to talk.  it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
okay.  so this is the story of how it happened.  okay.  it was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when i first started working for vinnie. the summer of the bicentennial.  a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. he's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. it was crowded around the counter just then, so i didn't see him at first....
i don't know... gotta be at least four to one.
i don't know.  i'm just guessing.
all right. five hundred.
we have to keep moving.
very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from moscow? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
now what happened? i'll bet hunk did that.
where do you hail from, doc?
ext. highway - day.
i don't see anything.
yes?
what's the matter?! it's a celebration!
well, that's because he's the devil. and he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of hell, causing my dad...
we've known debbie what, since the eighth grade? how many years of foreplay is that?
--that's right, sean. he mailed it to a professor at cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought ramanujan to england.
working under adverse conditions.  highly adverse conditions.
let me go, don amalio, i'll tear her apart.
a friend.  i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
that's right.
yah, got a front movin' in.
how is ben feeling?
you were having a nightmare.
i'm sorry, i didn't...
i'd go for penetration.  the 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
a weirdo making s+m films?  who'd have thought it?
you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.
yeah?
tell me again.
no, just one.
-- and now i got reporters from toadsquat, iowa, calling my office and askin' what i know about this "g.i. jane" thing.
well, dawn, i'm an optimist by nature.
did you see that?
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance?...he'll put a bullet in her brain! and i tell you martha would want him to!
bapu -- please. where are you going.
the only answer i have for you.
that can't be!  everything has an antithesis!  why not this?
please... go ahead and kill me! this stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
c'mon, pack your things. anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
what's that mean?
cole and munoz are going in the back door.  babbit is backing me.  so i want you at the side window by the hedge.  you're strictly backup, got it?
hey walter--
nightmare.
hey!  virgil!  my god!  morgan!  hey, boy!  you look great!  both of you!
he's being posted. i was terrible to him.
i doubt it.  it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. i know your feelings.  you'd best forget them.  it's for your own good. there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan.  it's the heart of the sith.  the bogan force is the most heavy there.
i do? i mean, yeah, i do.
good evening. very well, thank you. and you?
these seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
...like macaroni and cheese...
okay then.
no... i've seen her. good-looking woman.
how about them?
youíre in prague?
benjamin, i want to ask you something.
and making you feel bad at the same time, huh? but that's the way i am, you know, the way i've always been. always picking on poor little roy.
terrible. after this, no more ballets for me. jazz --  just jazz.
know what you are?! you're a prude, roper.
int. andy's ice cream factory/stairwell - day.
oh, no...did you say rio?
faith, i'm kidding.  is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  when you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
hmm, i see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
his honor, the mayor, now comes out with a statement that earl williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in molly malloy's joint. and this colored policeman, daniels, goes over to pick williams up. williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. that is all.
none of that, lady.
it's perfect.
no, it's not.
don't be ridiculous.
it seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. he thinks you should see a doctor.
you didn't, did you?  you didn't bring it, did you?
no, sir. i was empathizing. sorry.
i'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
that's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. you were dead wrong. we're only interested in one thing: can you tell a story, bart?  can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? is that more than one thing? okay.  the point is, i run this dump and i don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. why do i run it? i've got horse-sense, goddamnit. showmanship. and also, and i hope lou told you this, i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. did you tell him that, lou? and i don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. coffee?
are you kidding? the golden globe, the edward r. murrow award...
but nobody wants to see that. it’ll never go. they’ll rewrite you. you don’t want that.
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  you can afford to spend some money.  if i was you, i'd spare myself all the hard work.  besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
i know!  i know!
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. a fear of being gay. he objects to the word 'fairy.' plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead.  i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr. leeds.
yes.
go ahead, open it, open it.
peter's brother?  but --
let him come to the wedding.  you're not running, right?  say it. "i'm not..."
i'll do whatever i have to do.
we should have just ignored him.
whadda you care?
what happened?
so if you're not running and ike graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  all we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
dr. david ravell.
listen, you little worm.  i could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like i did last year, you got that?  you got that?
those are song lyrics, jerry.
sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
if someone has the horseman's skull... if they control the horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
but right now i'm acting in the capacity of mrs. schuyler's attorney.
they were ...
now that's scary!
then you are too ambitious.
for a fee.
we were looking for this bird.
really.  he has a cop's face.
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place. junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
that's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
i know enough.
okay.
where's the old bag i sometimes call mommy?
oh sure, let's string along poor walter, see how far it will take us!
please.
what?
and they get caught!
what about it?
--what?
if he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
yes you did. you been putting it up your whole life. you just didn't know it. you know what date is on this coin?
shhh... that's for me to know an' you to find out.
won't those two years in court be expensive for you? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
any criminal record?
not good enough, scotty. you've got to do better!
um ... it's ...
i'm sorry. you deserve to be shown.
int. vitelli's helicopter - day.
i mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, i--
oh, you're very clever. let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
i still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops.
i don't know.
like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft.  he doesn't have it here any more.  used to be like a rock.  too bad.  i think it's time for him to retire.
may life be good to you both. as for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and i will be with them.
oh, david.  there's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  you better go, my boy.  you'll be late for that aeroplane.
well, i'll give you a hint. by tomorrow they'll be calling me mrs. bruce baldwin.
hold it, hold it. here.
i appreciate all that, jeff. but, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
the next time i walk into a bank.
oh, god.
we'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. that's a perfect excuse. there was no other safe big enough.
to what? what are you saying? this ship is alive?
let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
i promise not to bring any more venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
i love you too. i'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. i was wrong.
i missed you.  i wondered if you were ever coming back.
what, it's worse? you're pregnant with an asian design major's child?
how do you figure?
it doesn't work on small animals!
why are you lying?
i'll be damned...
i agree, majesty, but i'm afraid it's not possible. the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop.
courthouse back in town.
i'm sure you would.
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god, wouldn't you say?
nothing...
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
i will not yield, sir! this same man-- mister taylor--came here to offer me a place in this senate for twenty years, if i would vote for a dam that he knew and *i* knew was a *fraud*! but if i opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! and i stood here one day and tried--i *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. the long, powerful arm of mister james taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
what...?
joe, you do get around.
agents who died in the field.
tough day.
the disc is still in there.
yeah?  maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
is that a threat?
me? i'm loaded with good! i mean i've never even used it.
your android has turned dangerously violent, captain... considerable damage was done to my ship. he must be destroyed.
no you're not.  you don't even care about being a mom.  how come you don't think about me?
i'm on her.
teddy was killed last night.
the things that get you excited.
back off, man!  i'm a scientist!
i want to talk to general ripper.
if you can't look anymore, i understand...
you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them. in fact, put moore in the ground too.
and i said i would never leave you.
yeah?
the metro.
exploring. in the woods. many years ago. -- i was a solitary child.
the numbers don't make sense, sir. his brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  one private is simply not worth a squad.  colonel anderson this one is.  he's worth a lot more than that.  which is why i'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
never would be plenty.
thanks.
you'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
uh huh.
you are the blacksmith.  ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
oooh. oh. miles. miles.
it doesn't matter where you sit!
marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  what the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  fuck marshaling the leads.  what the fuck talk is that? what the fuck talk is that?  where did you learn that?  in school?  that's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." our job is to sell.  i'm the man to sell.  i'm getting garbage.  you're giving it to me, and what i'm saying is it's fucked.
she must've fallen asleep at the table...
why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
i --
oh. uh. commencing diversion.  alarm in cosmetics.
it's all right, samuel- we all get hit- 
power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. if i can hit him. i can kill him. but i gotta be close. very close.
yes, i know.
hey, it's a sellable skill.
no.
it was nothing.  i'm almost finished.
i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  i know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
see what turns up--which i guarantee will be nothing. some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
we're going to paris?
you goin' back inside?
what is it? what's going on?
both dead.
well -- he died on a sunday and i have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels friday afternoon.
tell me.
at dawn, you were born. one eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. we gave you the sweet drink.
listen to me.
how would you know?
i wouldn't bet on that.
i'm trying, mom.
gonna have to put up cash.
huh?! he -- no, i -- he's just -- maybe i was a little rough on the boy, ya see i --
open up.
i see.
i gotta go take a piss.
no offense, kent. you're good, but lois is the best we've got.
go!
monkeybone...!?
they call me in when they've reached a dead end. freelance. like yourself.
we get off about the same time every night. we should hang out.  you get high?
i keep one eye open when i sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
you can't fire on them.  you're gonna detonate the crystals.
the moon is too round of face, methinks.
ben, i've got a ride home. maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
isn't this 4215 pussy way?
it was a different floor then...
no, please.  i shall be absolutely fine. they pass almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
open it.
welcome.
where do our records go to in the castle?
all right.  take care of yourself.
who died?
it was going too fast.
who me? nah, i'd just fuck them up. that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
to find rogue.
what happened?
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety.
ha!  don't make me laugh.  you're crazy about me!  that's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
why don't we run? just run now?
there are people down there having fun. i want to be one of them. i want you to be one of them. on monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of puerto rican rum and a fistful of cash.
your wife knows that, don't she?
designer clothes.
don't be absurd; it's only a play.
dude, what the hell is going on?
fuck plan c!
and what do you think you will find in another land?
let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
it was too noisy.
i said we'll talk later, roy.  if you're what i think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
yeah.  she was the one called joanne. how'd you find that out?
ok.  ok.
and cosgrove. coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. they weren't very high on seagrave, either.
what good is it? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. pretty vague. where do you start looking? maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. but the entire top portion is missing.
this is anthony adams, mr. henry.
the girl 3jane. we need her.
what?  if we just believe in buckaroo banzai?
what sign?
you're not sorry.  you're scared.  you're a psychologist, norman.  you pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  and now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
a handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. doctors, people who have to touch you. but not by people who want to.
yeah.
oh, fuck you! fuck you, sam rothstein!  fuck you!
how soon can we get up and running?
we said a hundred.
what is bail?
god damn you--what is happening? is there no man who'll have me?  this is the weirdest season i ever saw--the durham bulls can't lose and i can't get laid!
we usually find nothing.  we've debunked many a reported haunting. about ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
this is great, this gives me hope.  thanks.
take it into the living room, would you, hon?
which one of us is the informer?
i don't know. i guess so.
what do you want me to do?
if i could have a blade, then i would be please to run with you.
[beat] i know it doesn't make sense. it doesn't even make sense to me.
well, you know, "the whole thing's theatre..."
look, jason, i need some fast answers if i'm ever gonna fix what i've done.
then why do you call it harlin's?
tell him "bride" is in pre- production.
susie, i want to help you--, there's nothing i won't do for you. you're all i've got in the whole, wide world.
yes, we've heard that. doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? isn't that right? you, you're available for that? when you're paid to be there?
to bring you... your birthright.
there you two are. i walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
i don't know.
leo spanked a waitress?
i remember you...in the elevator.
is that what you're trying to tell me?
pull up next to him!
right. claims assessor.
... okay.
listen, i gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
never mind.  he died two years ago.
who?  who's doing this to you?
but then i won't need your money.
it's okay. it's okay.
okay.  at least let me show my appreciation.  the secretary of labor is going to be indicted on wednesday. for the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
just yes? no mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? that frightens me.
yes, she will. you see if she isn't. and i'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
to us. and to the seeds we'll plant together.
really? really!!!
yeah.
some places, not all.  italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  but try bloody britain, anywhere in the u.k., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  food's not our thing, you see.
yeah, i can see where that'd--
what makes you say that?
hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
that true, fergus? you in love?
she's a <u>waitress</u>.
did she talk about him to you?
he's just loaded, honey.
no, sir. it is a gorch.
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. to know god, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
you spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. know something's up. with a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
that's crazy!
i asked him, "lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  and he said, "bomb the shit out of hanoi, boy!  bomb them where they live." ... john, do you think i was too soft on tv?
i'm very tired. and i'll have a long drive tomorrow. all the way back to phoenix.
i can't stand to see you like that. i know you can't help it.
i— i brought this for you, terry. it was joey's.  yours is coming out at the elbows.
why isn't it doing anything!?
i completely understand ...
really?
well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.
i'll fuckin' take it. to go.
thank you for seeing me.
have you tried to ask the god for anything?
i like you.
christ!
quite the opposite, in fact.
i forgot something--something at home. i'll see you later.
not really. kill the little bastard. see what i care.
ellie, com one!!
and here you got two mornings every day. wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
so, what is it you do, mister...?
it's something.
yeah, that's comforting.  mine, too.
yes, sir.  he issued attack orders to --
who pays for them?
yes.
it's already built!  there's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  we're sitting right on top of it -- here.
yes, you are. you're protecting somebody. now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. it can't be as important as this. now come on, tell me. where were you last night?  come on, don't be a fool. matt, you trust me, don't you?
because i bought the windshield last week. i'm a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do.
we gotta get outa here, dodge. a storm blows up and we're history.
what are you talking about?
interesting.
you don't know for sure.  what about roy?  nobody's seen him.
i mean in show business.
he seems to have won it.
i'm not wearing any.
how long have you been standing here?
rochester? well, why rochester?
all right then we've got clean rats.
okay, but it's not a date.  it's a dinner.
i got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
yeah. scary stuff.
i'll go. you have the bridge.
i vote for me.
me?  i don't know what you mean.
i wish i could help you.
it's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
oh.  okay.
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
when i'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
my god -- don't you recognize mouton -- our regimental dog?  i would rather eat cossack.
bruce, i know, but i was in the biggest jam --
what happened to her?
you're sweet.  and sexy.  and completely hot for me.
i don't want to be responsible for his food. just a small green salad. and a perrier.
high school physics, luthor. while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
so where is he?
the plane is fine.
what a pleasant hobby.
what did you do with her?
not likely, reggie.  maybe i just need some help.
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
carter...you ready to have some fun!?
headed there now. the same shift will be on at noon.
hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
yeah, you did.  i told you not to but you did anyway.
regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
aha.
i can't lose more than a hundred.
sometimes it's not enough!
i'm glad i saw it before becoming extinct.
how long you been married?
even if this vincent luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
right.
oh... i'm sorry. was i singing again?
i had to.  you made me.
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century.
i don't wanna spoil it for you, doug. just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  now you tell me.  is that worth three hundred measly credits?
it's somebody's idea of a joke.
how do i look?
gonna be tough.
joanne bourne.
they're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. it's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night. then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
would you like to see where i was tattooed?
they tell me you use narcotics. could i bring someone around to look at your arms?
i see.
yes it was.
mickey spillane?
what's the question?
did you see the tape?
not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
sorry - it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
she doesn't need the money, for crissakes. she's living with monty. i know it.
who's on the phone, now?  what do you mean... throw it on you?  you knew it, right?
probably the caffeine.
nothing.  he held her and he wept. because he...
what other ways are there to get illegal films?  who do you see?
so let's go. this place creeps me out.
first you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! makes a person feel cheap.
it's not our fault.  we're naturally nervous.
i always knew you'd do the job.
look deeper.
good... good boy. oh yes, i understand you're fond of music. i have arranged a little surprise for you.
yeah, you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'i'd kiss you, but...'
i want to introduce a couple of people. doc white is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
the bonaventure. the bonaventure hotel. do you know where that is?
what for?
it's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  i feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one i can trust.
don't let's take any chances.
on my way. please notify commander riker.
the trap door. that's how he escaped the fire...
if you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
you know, i can remember once, getting back below the dmz -- and the first americans we ran into were a track squadron. i just couldn't believe how much water they had. we'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. and there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. i could've killed them.  i swear to god i would have, too, if ...
but one day i'll catch you... like i caught her...
we're on our way home. i just...we're running a little late.
yeah.
yeah.
fight fire with fire.  threaten to go to her husband.
i have never seen such a stone. will you please tell me where it came from?
it's not the police. it's the department of transport. internal politics. it's a joke. they have no idea who we really are
you know my name?
sometimes neither.
any planets?
that's funny!
jesus christ, pop.  you got two hours until your plane leaves.
don't need to, the krauts go that covered.
in the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
yes, to cease to hope is the greatest crime.  the greatest crime.  perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>i</u> never ceased to hope!
no.  i never drink -- wine.
for a while.
watch the news?
it's boston, mr. mayflower.
oh god, oh god no.
don't even...i'm there.
we're on our third pitcher of beer. just ask me.
she's gotten worse, father. she won't eat, she won't talk. the child won't even let me touch her.
ten pounds.
so was i.
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission...
well, i don't think i can walk.  i mean, i been falling down a lot and, uh...
what do you mean?
really? care to make a wager on that?
you're new to charenton, yes? perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
i scared you -- i crossed the line --
i don't get the distinction.
happy, we've got the man. horace miller!
try to calm down. just think, you're going to be famous!
why would you need two time zones? you never leave beverly hills.
they’re german jews. came here before the war. they both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon. it’s not guilt, more of a curse...  and then there’s something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters... but i think that’s just one of leon’s dark delusions...
i can't go out.
nice.
listen to what you're saying, mom. is there any evidence she is?
six people mutilated? it had to be me, alex.
now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
if we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  a lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  no offense.

if they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
you found the body. she was one of harold speck's victims. in el paso.  they're not just talking to each other, mack, they're trading souvenirs.
wilfred, that's not bad.
no, i don't think so.
you see, my wife -- i mean, your wife -- that is, i mean hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.

debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
blank faces here, o'neil.
okay.
like for you to look for the man.
i don't trust anyone. you don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. it's in your nature to steal. i'm just protecting my investment.
everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
yes, i am looking after him.

susanville, soledade.
don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
oh yeah, i forgot.
and i understand why you might want to think he could.
i didn't say anything.
oh, i'm sorry, wait a minute, i have something. well, what about saturday night?
all right?
that's all right.  i'm sure they're quite lovely.
don't worry.
i woke to the sound of zoe's breathing.  it was laboured.  i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  i grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
warm them up.
i will.
what do you want me to say?

...and she's with someone else.
oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. mr. norton wants to get back of it and sponsor john doe clubs all over the country. he wants to send you on a lecture tour.
someone else can help you. someone else can make you happy.
want to join me in some cartwheels?
who did?
it'll be wonderful! i'll show you my old stomping grounds!
what do you think i'm doing?  look.  whether you believe it or not, krueger is back.  he's after the baby and if i don't try to do something about it, who will??

mom, black folks been praying to god for four hundred years. maybe it's time we tried something else...
tippecanoe and tyler, too!
ich, my name is nick.  not nicklaus, not nicklaus-san, not nick-san. nick.

how do these work i wonder?  i got- ta save one to show the high aldwin.
i just joined up.  but i'm quitting! i got a trial membership!
hell no! the way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gonna stay up all night saturday, he added. always afraid something is going to happen.
i ain't got no eyes.  you want to see?
i love her.
walter, i'd love to --
you didn't beat me that day.  i beat <i>myself</i>.
yes, ma'am. a lot of water under the bridge.
hmmm?
i think it looks nice.
you're a horrible person, barry.  i mean it.

fresno.
roger.
let me feel that.
but all ends well.

well, it ain't just the bed i'm gonna miss. i'm...  hell, billy, i'm sorry. i didn't mean...
conan o'brien? whoa! what are you doing here?
it'll cost you.
oh.
talk? about me--about us?
we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
what are you people talking about?
i'm not positive this means anything.
gee, i wonder why.
are you going to listen?
she say she in great pain.
sure, sure!  everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
thank you, eve.
one more round.
what... huh?
i'm sorry.  i don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  you've been a great help to me, and i've let you down.
so... what? so we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
how i go.
it’s okay. the cops did it.
but i didn't see...
nothing.  i just wanted you to know i was out.  i just wanted to see you.
oh, angela! go with these trappers! they'll lead you safely down the mountain...
we're entering a capillary. remain in the middle.
yes, mama.
i signed-up for the stock option.
i'm not knocking it.  it's a great solution.  not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
i heard them.
god, no.
gettin' in is easy. it's getting out i'm thinkin' of.
very nice.  i'll take it.
no, no, no.
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
you got the wrong girl, sam.

where do you get your ideas?  only joking -- i'm just joking.  let's go to a brothel then, kafka, come on.
yes, cherie, of course you want more. and i'll show you how to get it. you drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? never again.
they'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
that's not fair. you're taking all the fun out of it.
don't i know you?
is vanessa here?
his highness has not yet taken a wife.
right now--everything i own--!
walter, please--
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming.
there's no hard evidence he knew about this. anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
you got it.
can't kill another one.  can't.  can't kill my friends anymore.
... i've seen them, too.
lily... jesus christ...
what is her illness?
yes?
right again. you're no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.
that rhymes.
what just happened?
shut up, you dummy.  who did this to you?
i'm looking!
it's not nice to be evasive.
yeah, but i'm remembering all kinds of stuff. like...my user wants me to go after the mcp
i won't be made to feel like i've done something wrong.
it's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
well, i don't think i can remember it.

and they think they are protecting my by moving.
he's at home.  listen, i can't believe he went to the store.  i'm mortified, actually.  i'm really sorry.  he had no right to do that, and i told him so.
respect is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
look, you guys know how it is. you just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your user knows what's goin' on.
say it in english.
i know who you are, gabriel marion. the last time i saw you, i was nine and you put ink in my tea.
boxin'.
oh my g-d.
i wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded beanie babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
because i fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
i really think you're -

helluva time for vanity!
big duke six to baker delta four -- hold -- we're right over you.
how about the nudity?
it's not that easy.  maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  i can't. i don't want to be alone.  i need to know i'm going to be taken care of.
stop it!
seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee-wee hours.
and you're not?  maybe you're my puppet.  but like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  it's the puppet's dream.  wondering if they're human!
i swear to you that's all that happened.  i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
one more down.  someone tried to kill adrian.  . . . first time i've ever heard him scared.
you think it over.  no reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
only one you've never broken.
holy cow.
you could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
get on the bus.
the struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
i don't need a tuxedo.
- torque wrench.
you slept too near where you got in?
yeah.
these are exciting times, henry. we're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. look at edward jenner. he wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
i don't think so.
animals kill only from hunger or fear. the man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
did you offer the young lady some fruit?
medusa... what's this? some kind of club?
i think i came. didn't you feel it?
that's bullshit, son.  but it's really good bullshit.
very little.  i must be going...
a coup d'etat! of course, that was foreseen by lenin himself!
god's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
don't worry. nobody's going to disturb you.
i'm not happy that i'm 35 playing a 21 year old. i'm not happy that i have to die naked!  and i'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into mcnuggets.
diet soda?
she needed it.
don't call me father.
...of kittens...
that's what you were supposed to be!
because i like to torture you.
howard!
someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. now, as i so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...god. so would your holiness care to change her password?
if you know, i know.
well, whatever you think.
he didn't give me a chance.  look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
yes, sweetheart, shh.
yeah, you don't want to tire him out, doctor.
thank you, data.  let's see what she can do.
it'll do just fine.  bye-bye, see you later.
what, as a sales rep?
officer, i can explain.
th—that's all right. if you didn't call me sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  there are snickers from the background.
milo! what about --?
coming.
and what happens when these guys stop paying?  sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  then where are we?
we ain't got nothing to talk about.
i <i>was</i>...
you said they would be here, goddamnit! where are they?
<u>i</u> ruined?  with all due respect, i told you to abort --
i know.
did you have a nice time?
frank, but not now. frank. you're trying to wipe out some old business. but not now. i understand. but you go call 'em back. you call the bishop back.
ooooooohh. now we're getting somewhere.
are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
well, not much ed. just doin' some stuff for this guy.
you're the man with the gun.
jesus, first mars, now you.  you two need anti-depressants.
someone blew the whistle.  someone hates me.
well, goddamn.  are you threatening me, dick?
i've got a job.
don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
you couldn't do that, doctor.
...captain rhodes is trying to...
let's see!
what?
ouch!
maybe ten minutes...  thatís strange.
can you think of a better one?
i'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. form the eighth dimension, i think.  look...
how do you know? personal experience?
oh, yes, i do, joe. believe me. you say you're going to lose. is it my fault? listen! the damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
i'm serious.
hi.
i think you're fucking crazy!
then again, that's easy for me to say, since i'll never even get a date. i'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
still think we're finished?
no, i'm sorry, darling, i told you i won't be home for a few days.
boy, this is good!
not really.  i triggered the alarm..
hmmm.
well, i can't get out and look, king.  but i don't get a green light.
yeah... me too.
that was twenty years ago. with digital? they can suck a salt grain off a beach.
rae don't do this now...
i mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? if he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
look, i don't know, kent. . . clark  personally, i think it could be a terrific story!
well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  what's your name?
i can't give up looking for her, mrs. redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
not yet. i'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
let me tell you somethin', boy! i don't care if both of my legs was cut off! i can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
i just want to spend time with them when i'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
i'm over it. whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
well, there's a lot of communistic sympathizers around --
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of archangel de jesus montoya?
you love walks.
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
go to hell.
awww, it's just been a shitass day. every inch of it hot and miserable. first off, nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick, so that mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. that fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from rice krispies. i ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
fire!
that don't match either of the victim's.
good lord, what do we do?
we do sleep lying down.
there is no relevant precedent.
you can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
how'd you sleep, honey, okay?
james, where did you grow up?  was it around here?  around baltimore?
well, i guess i got it wrong, then. seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
do you ever get sick of it?
wait a minute. wait a minute. al, you leave my heart alone...
you know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago.
you mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
you're a sick fuck, fink.
if the weather holds it might not be so bad.
that's right, mr. sheldrake. i won't be needing it -- because i'm all washed up around here.
he's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
we're gonna try.  place needs a lot of work.
it's a pretty ring.
so signor miles drove away and you did what?
 there's gotta be...
please!
under <u>water</u>?
i never make bets or guesses, that way i'm never wrong and i never have to pay out.
thank you. i learn a great deal.
well what do i tell him?
tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. you show 'em your id with the letters "f.b.i." in all caps and it's instant compliance. i've seen in happen a hundred times.
what's inside the sphere.
neither do i... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
the crowd is really with the movie. some even talk to the screen. "you dumb bitch. get out of the house." etc.
no, but that definitely sounds like shots and i don't where it's comin' from --
would you like some brandy?
but pappy, they's inter-grated.
son of a bitch!
i don't think we have anything to talk about.
you scared the shit out of me. i thought you were killing yourself.
i'll call you right back.
well, i see it still smells like pine needles in here.
if you're doing all this just for me.
english muffin.  how do you do it?
yeah, we have a van.
well, it's been better. i can't seem to get going on this thing. that one idea, the one that lets you get started – i still haven't gotten it. maybe i only had one idea in me – my play. maybe once that was done, i was done being a writer.  christ, i feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
[i want you.]
yes they are! look how much more hair i have than you!
what do you mean, "in no time"?
if you were my boyfriend, i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
he was insane, baby: a mad dog. i put him out of his misery --
baby, take it easy.
it's aterm of service, not a career. i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years.
they what? what? no. no. why?
do you know how much it costs to go to new york?
you're fourteen years old here?
ssssh!
i thought he would be seeing you before i would, and would give it to you.
you look great.
why are you being so mean?
tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and i'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
w-w-whatta you mean?
uh-oh.
cynthia. john.
"the second rule of fight club... is this yours?
the bastard.  he can blow his nose all the way.
sort of.
what <u>is</u> your problem?
different?
hold it a minute.
what's that?
i guess.
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in death's design.
nothin'.
get down on your knees.
wha'?
i got fed up with all the bullshit.
he is, i believe, a brother.
i don't understand.
hitler!
that is so romantic.
and you?
yes.
well, therapy. and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back. i was living in a fairy tale.
i need it tomorrow. if i don't show up for work tomorrow, i'm fired.
i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica.
yeah?
you splendid bastard...
tremoille, i'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
oh, you know... don't fuck this up. i'll kill you. i'll kill your family. i'll shoot your dog... all the usual. then he said good luck.
put those away.  we can't have marks on his wrists.
sure you do. this ward is air tight, i have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
bullshit ... i ain't moving  till i get something to eat. you've been treating me like shit ever since i came out here.  if you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  and i want some food some place nice.. some good people, nice music...
no. she ate a pistol for lunch one day.
christ if i shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  i've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.

oh my god, he's back.
your father is frantic with worry. our mission was to rescue you and return home.  that is what we shall do.  mr. turner's fate is regrettable.  but so was his decision to engage in piracy.

it's my kid. i've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
when will i see you again?
what happened to your toe?
geller, you don't want a reporter's life. they're very--messy. you're all about order. control. and getting me my copy by five.
it is. you just up and quit. there are other jobs, and they pay better money. you're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. so what's stopping you?
romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes, by her high forehead and her scarlet lip, by her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! o, romeo that she were an open ass, and thou a poperin pear! romeo, good night: i'll to my truckle-bed; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
i didn’t intend it that way... it just happened.  he heard from laurence that you’d been back.  that we’d argued. he asked why and it just happened; i told him everything... i couldn’t help it. wanted to see him scared. i had never seen him scared before, you see...
i'll do it.
what do you mean?
for their meat.
but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.

i've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
maybe their whole technology is based on that. controlling water.
did you do it?
i never danced before -- in public.
what difference does it make where she comes from?
you couldn't say.
you want an address on that last one?
what what? what advantages?
what are you, nuts? you think she's coming back?
start the countdown.
look, i don't know what you want--
never drive again!
you got any books in there?
this is quite a place.
why there is no other man in my life?
get out. get out of here, goddammit.
where's burke?
i'm going to tell you a secret now, elaine.  simone is not a real person.  i invented her.
hang on a second.
pretty fast, wasn't it.  the way they let him go.
you know, there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you. america's comfort to misunderstood wives. i never thought i would find myself in that class.
then, close the case.
look, you seem a little agitated. do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
hello.
yeah, just a nick ...
what're you, nuts? we had pancakes for breakfast. i gotta go somewhere i can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  not more fuckin' pancakes. come on.
how far?
okay, give me the keys.
'cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. so after seven years indentured service in virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  their name was cameron. john & alexandria.
what?
how many times have you done this? i'm interested.
but the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
maybe it's better that way.
but jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
what are you going to do?
yeah, it's terrible.  i mean valli, and i don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  he probably had it coming, but all the other people.  real sad.
yeah, dickhead.
great.
open it.
dad's here.
well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as i can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
i take it you still want the money...
you want me to lie.
i'll be twenty next year, sir.
no.
transference.
well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
yup.
jerry?  please.  stop this.
i love you so much.
what do you want?  encouragement?  'gosh, buffy, you're so special, i just want to give you a great big hug, oh i'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
sir, i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
you married?
look, bodhi man.  people are dead. the ride is over.
you're getting too cool for me, j.d. i don't know how to talk to you.
right.  call me christy.
i'm ruth's niece. my name's betty. i'm sure she told you i was coming.
wait...i need that...
i was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so i closed it up.
i, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? you're worried about my business?
i want to just talk. i want to talk to that irish bitch.
you sure?
stop!  stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...i overheard you and pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...do you believe me?
here, have some.
i haven't been invited.
i think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
not interested. 
liar, you fell asleep. pig!
no, we don't mind.  you mind leon?
then i shall make use of this starship.
come on, bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. it's my money.
frank.
riots?  my people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
i gave it to you.
my, it's good to be....
old woman?
who wrote it?
tell her i'm almost home.
no, it's not.
yes, sir.
sit.
it was like some big fucking secret!
that's where i get off.
that's all going to change, yori...
how do you mean?
okay, jerry. you're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that ciera.
clean?
anyway, what i was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
i need you to pass me fit now, molly.
of course, he'll love it. you're a terrific artist.
believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
what d'you mean, take the table away?
have you ever tried american girls?
i love two things. i love you, and i love the opera. if i can have the two things that i love together for one night, i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
what do you think?  maybe i could reach the ledge without falling. no, forget it.
don't play with me, kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
probably not.
uh-huh. look, this should be skintight.  bright colors.  red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
i'll see you reach the wizard, whether i get a heart of not.  bee-hive -- bah!  let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! you know -- hmm? what's that?
deal. and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
nah. i don't play well with others.
i wanna take that fucking blind in- stitute to pieces .. every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
'u.s.s indianapolis.' 1944.
i've come to see you, sir, about an auction...
there's more.
how many times have you shocked him tonight?
sid, you don't have to.
let's hope not. license and registration please.
ssshhhhh!
look, i came down here to face everybody.  i didn't want to slink away like some coward...
sorry.  wasn't me.
no, i'm hiding out.
oh yes, of course - you've just been elected.
you figure!
you think i'm some whacko?  i like to hurt people?  i'm doing a job here.  if i knew what's right or wrong i'd be a goddamned priest, right?  so i follow directives... i do what i'm told.  it's simple.  if your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
hey, chili? look at me.
stop the tape, okay.  forget it, ellen.  let's call security and get him out.
no i'm not.
a woman.
i can sit up straight.  i just can't..sit up straight very well.  it's not important!  i saw who shot me.  ethan, i saw the mole.  it was kittridge.  <i>kittridge!</i>
i read the article.
it's a single malt, glenmorangie. i thought you'd like it. anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
fine. my mistake. you know, i'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
come around to three-three-four...
because he was scary, that's why.
fictions, my friend. the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman... so we repaired to paris...
do jimmy durante!
you know i love spaghetti.
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed.
yeah. i mean besides that.    they treating you all right? food okay?
just perfect.
that's why we came here, remember?
soap?
you're kidding.
this cannot be.
a stereo type alarm system?
no, baby, don't! can i send you somethin'? you runnin' low on money? i'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
paul. rashid. thomas. which one is it?
every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
mary, i'm a farmer -- always will be. to me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but i guess you're right. we just got to do it. oh -- how's it all going to end?
what do you want me to do about it?
well, sir, consider the possibilities. a:  ryan is alive.  we have to take him back to the beach.  knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
me too.  i feel awake.
michael fitzsimmons! is he here?
maybe now's when you tell me about it.
as opposed to good?
you asked me if i had a dream. i said "sure, i have a dream. i just don't know what it is yet."
the...
i think that about does it, spooky.
i'm the one.  i did it.  i tore down paul's posters.
yes, ma'am, it is.
it's an american boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
i'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
but your men are watching over yu's compund?
gibarian warned me.  he left me a message.
if you want to go on, i can make it all right.
of course it is.
this looks promising...
lewis carroll, who wrote alice in wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
just now. she's thrilled. and the kids.
i dreamed of him too... merlin lives! he lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. he speaks to us from there.
what?
drew, i know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
doolittle... i think it's the phoenix asteroids!
we're not going that route.  sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
yes, i think so.
afraid i'm ruining your reputation, m'sieu laval?
don't sulk.  what brought all this on?
aren't they precious?  ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. does she have any relatives in the area?
you met him. walt waldowski, the dental officer.
tired?
what makes him so special?
that's charity. she's out back. she'll be free in half hour.
exactly.  the trick is, you gotta pick your target.  they have to be nice little housewife types. school-teachers.  but, i'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
two an' a half! say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
just a few then. the big ones.
and church will be fine.
i told you we don't know for certain.
i'm incarcerated, lloyd!  i don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  i don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  and i can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
serafine...?
you mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  what a good detective you are.
aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
i give you my word. put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
you bringing your new friend?
...who?
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
and the deal goes down at another place at another time.
now's the perfect time.  the animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
hyatt... friedman’s... at the hyatt...
half a flounder. hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
and they will be again, spock. that's the beauty of it.  how much?
no, i gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. don't look at the ball, look at me.
:oh, i wish. a woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. no, they don't think that way.
right.
what a beautiful thought, marquise.
do you want to go or not?  i'm offering you a way out of here.
if she paid you well?
clever.
well, rack up your cue. we're leavin'.
probably up a pole starving itself to death.
well, it's just when i see a really good movie i really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. it's sort of tradition. do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
yes. michael myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
good.  i want you to like it here. i wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
yes i do! i know exactly what i am saying.  and if it is sedition, then i am guilty of sedition, too!
me? i said... nothin'. i said, i said, 'no, no, no.' everything he said, i just kept sayin' no.
i just wanted to distract them. i wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
anacott steel. buy it.
i saw his stuff in the bathroom.
hi.  will i ever sing again?
nellie fox.  walter likes the past.  and he likes the little guys.
the way i figure it, it was them or me. i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? bought a little time. made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around. but it's just us on this ship. us and your... spirit friends.
when i have something to say.
yes.
sam.
you're upset.
we let lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
yes, thanks.
see, i'm new.
yes...
you heard me.  why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
who?
maybe we can stop there for lunch.
your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... all this time, i've never had the courage to touch it.
dad, don't start.
of course, sir.
yeah, i know.  this is it, isn't it?
she's not irena's child -- there's nothing of irena in her. she's my child.
where'd you learn how to do that?
no. ours was damaged.
no, no. look. ok. let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
you pathetic piece of shit. i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
i'm sorry - i didn't think
yes, ma'am.  lead the way, sam.
uh, with all due respect, sir, dr. long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
i am see-threepio, human-cy...
city hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - i see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
i wasn't knocking anything. it's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
god, i never thought of that.
well, i -
you at least bring the gun?
oh, darling -- so will i.
bam bam.
not this time.
sure, mr. muss -- uh, sid said i could have the job back.
i know daddy. i'm worried about him.
yes, indeed.  it's cost my family quite a bit of money.
do you believe that?
missing????
jim, that bunch is out for blood. if i throw horace in their teeth now--
get away from that door.
you mean there's something you haven't asked me?
everything okay?
veidt¹s complex.
down boy.
think i could rent a scooter?
i came to see you. how you feel?
no english lord would trust an irishman!
and tell me that she's happy.
it's because he's too tired to sleep. he has to.
if you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, i'll have him hold it for you.
stop calling me vernon.
sure.  i really like annie.
but you don't have the money?
i'm calling gary.
hello.  i wonder if i could have a little word.
has he been hurt?
alan's in utah.
so's my johnson.
you like to play games, don't you, peter?
you know what he did.  he's doing it again.
they have him in the lobby, go quickly.
what about you, mare? how the hell'd you manage to stay single?
ah.  then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  so if you'll excuse me ...
well, i was just calling to see how you're doing.
perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can't he right, can it?
when he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
i know that. but --
just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
scared, huh?
you want me to give up, huh?  look, sal's in back with the girls. anything happens to me - one move - and sal gives it to them.  boom boom.  how do i know you won't jump me?
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
she went to the fight with herb shuttle, i guess.
because i didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
oh, no--no!  my dear *senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take french leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
lloyd?
buddy deeds--
no? how come?
i wouldn't mind being famous.
was there anything unusual about the driver, dolores driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
i don't want to be a fool!... i want to look them in the eye and say, i know!
he's a big one.
all of it. about him, an' you an' uncle pete... about robbin' the rock island pacific... an' about them missouri banks.
i find most criminals slip up somewhere...
is there anything else i should know about him?
oh no...
so far..
i've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
uh . . . no, man. i got some work to finish up here.
but "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  how perfect does your child have to be?
it does.
in the car?
well, what am i supposed to do?
man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. all the cats.
not that i know of.
agents.
i... no. you do this for money?
they said five hundred.  i said six. they said the man in the gray flannel suit.  i think i said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
how much provocation am i to endure from you? the more license i allow you, the more you take.
for you.
this girl has a child?
how's that?
s'pose you've never thought of killing him--
perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me philip?
...not at all.
he should. four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
why would they fire at him without provocation?
and then?
no, i don't think i am, susie.  anyone else?
you quit?
it's my subway defense system.
no, it was another woman.
you know, i - i'm too upset right now. and - an end has to be put to this.
sid, why would a guy like pierce patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
so?  it's going to break sugar's heart when she finds out i'm not a millionaire.  that's life.  you can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
yeah, nine years straight.
i don't know.
there won't be any rest of the trip. over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. so keep your money. you'll need it for the fare. i'm fed up with you. i was fed up with you before we started.
little slow tonight.
that beynon's got a long arm.
as a matter of fact, i do sing a little.
what's that?
would it be asking too much, miss gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
i wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
i'll be a nice gaiijin.
put on your blue suit...
march 11th.
you gave them the tape?
plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
shoot him.
don't worry.  i've done my homework.  i'll get pollux to talk.
why did you send me after friedman? to atone for your sins?
sock her!
i like women like that!
i'm not the first lady, anymore.  i shouldn't be here.
those "dears" sound like daggers. may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak?
if you'd like to tell me, yeah.
you got me beat on both accounts.
well, thank you very much. you can go now.
it'll all be over tomorrow. no more wars. no more killin'. just livin' normal like everybody else.  you'll be stuck with me for good.
but not unless nashville really inspires me.
they'd never make it in time.
no.  he would give it away.  i know how to repay a consideration.
i don't know.
where's the professor?
well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
i should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? or would you prefer jail?
are we in some kind of trouble?
yes.  au revoir...
...cannot go on the air.
sleep is all stress reduction. here.  you take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  why do you think i'm telling you this, frank--for my health?  you ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. kanita, get him a glass of water.
how do you like your bath, sir?
i can turn on all the faucets in my house.  even the hose.
heh heh. thank god.
god, i've never seen anything like this before.  are all of these indian designs authentic?
yeah.
it's good.  let him go.
d.c., chief.
you feign ignorance?
no.
i don't think so. it's like a tv station. and they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
kind of. except we've already got the keys.
we've broken a lot of promises, haven't we luke?
we never had a problem with that before.
mr. gardiner, my editors and i have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? something on your political philosophy. what do you say?
at least i'm a growing person.
i need my sodding parents' consent.
 he once made me an improper suggestion.
he could?
never mind how i found you.
hey karl, you off work?
how is she?
then take the final step... give me the enterprise... and we can be together... always.
but...
roger.
misunderstood what!?
the trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
yep.
and then sunday?
boy, that's terrific.
get the car.
no good. i said they disabled the communications system.
oh yeah.
certainly not to me.
uh-huh. another news clipping. another one about sid's mom. dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
yep...  yes...  it is.
at the old house with the voice.
mmmmmmmmmmmm.
ok. ok. fine. but -- do you believe in god?
no, fax is no good, that's what i have and i can't read the darn thing -
yes.
thought you might get lonely, mad- martigan!
yes.  cyberdyne systems, model 101.
well that's not going to happen tonight. george said carlton's a nice guy.
hold your goblet with two fingers.
we are at least four acts short, will, if you are looking for disaster.
i'm a man.
go on.  good so far.
so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
ok. take your coat, ann?
i just don't want to go over it any more.
i heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
i think he's lying to us. i could see it in his eyes.
jimmy.  i don't know.  i got so much else on my mind.  i got the kids.  we got no money.
i'll be waiting on deck.
no.  what's wrong?
don't spend too much time searching. you ever vetted somebody's old code before?  it's a different skill. stay close to the surface. the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. you know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  in a tree.
look, the girls of xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. next month we'll be back to normal.
i can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. she's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies. i've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
i'm a cook. do you understand 'cook?'
i'm not sure where i can talk anymore.
what we gonna do?
look, look, just get off my property.
i know. let her alone.
need a lift?
easy.  slow is best.
so you'll think about it?
michael, i...
of course.
you didn't like them.
oui.
yes, sir.
i'm sorry... you said it hurt?  why?
we don't -- ?
otis what?
why, of course.
better.
it seems fine.
it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. i told them. i told you.
fine with fucking me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
--and the ass of the man who adores her.
you've just to love me and i'll be the happiest woman around.
you've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? your last one left you when the cops came... and now luke. you should complain to the s.p.c.a.
oh --
that's good. i like to watch, too.
i don't think so, sir.
can see you do. sorry i couldn't make you feel better. you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... and the theft, is what you want to do!  sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. how about that?
i don't know.
what do you want the kid to say?
i remember when i first started reading these i thought dwf stood for "dwarf!"
i'm glad of it, honey.
saving them some paperwork.
congratulations, brother.  i've been waiting for you.
oh, my god.
now i
oh, i forgot to tell you, they're prescription x-ray glasses. i have very bad astigmatism.
maneuvering thrusters, sir.
you probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  dreams work like that.  you want me not to go on this job?
--he's not my husband!
thank you.
oh? oh, really? now we're getting down to it.
oh, there are so many.
okay, okay... they discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. they're frightened for themselves, their families... maybe it's the homo angle. maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake?
then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. i got somethin' to show you.
i've met someone else.
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
i'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  get this door open!
yeah, i thought he was supposed to be helpful.
can't you make other creations?
amy, there's nothing there. there's no one at all in the garden.
and too many of them are produced.
swear.
depends, don' it.
all set, ann?
and still mrs. harold ryan?
boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
ma...
you know who you're fuckin' with?! huh? do you?!
well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
uh, i didn't hear the...
are we in brooklyn?
we're losing the war, aren't we.
hello... my name is john merrick. i am very pleased to meet you.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
our mistake.  but what does it matter; it was our money.  we don't even expect thanks.
take it off! take it off!  ...s'il vous plait?...
immigration officer?
i was hoping we could talk.
cost less.  that's the point.
but i'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
chekov's on reliant, isn't he?
uh-huh?
just her neighbor and doctor? that's all?
i think it was a disgrace.
i'll have it for supper.  so long.
you know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
yes, sir?
okay.
i don't know what i'm gonna do... you know.  boy... i'm dying.
christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
why should everyone dance the same way?  it's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
i don't know...
first of all, mr. fox, you can't just come barging in here. and what makes you think it's his birthday?
then take her to radio shack.
who are you? what are you doing to me?
that's great.  i was afraid i'd have to go to sleep.
that so.
'yes. you're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
walk? naturally i can walk.
neat. goodnight!
it was just a trim.
i don't mind her if you don't.
do you hear from him, son?
can't help myself.  corbett's type always pisses me off.  oh, i found this at the post office.  had your name on it.
like the saber-toothed tiger.
great! ... if he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. come on -- beat it. it's five o'clock. you need some sleep.
the rangers and dea are heading out to the desert this morning. you gonna join 'em?
you were a galahad, compared to some cops i've known.
talk not to me, for ill not speak a word. do as thou wilt for i have done with thee.
not for long...
sure, sure. i've heard it before.
max sayer -- national echo.
second you get something on those teeth, i want it
if you knew why, you might know where to look for him. i don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  now, i've done what you asked me.
that was your dinner!  i do hope there is no cabbage in paris!
you lie!
me? why me?
broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. this is too much fun for one person.
i was doing it for them.
hell, no. i ain't goin' down in the ditch.
take a guess.
first of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
yes i did.  i said mmmmmm!
yeah, sure.  i'm corky.
you're going.
do justice and the fbi know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
ninotchka, or shall i say special envoy yakushova...
it tells me what every face tells me.  everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  what is it you want?
sounds perfect? what do i owe you?
and where you goin'?
find out anything you can...you got a grand coming. 
i frisk you?
just a minute, rose, you don't understand. this isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. a neighbor of cousin hop's, i talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! stop crying, rose! do you hear me? stop crying, it's ideal!
i'll tell you in a minute. first, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
say again?  all after incinerators?
i, the best knight in the world, bested! this is a great day, for my search is over. i love you, my king.
last night you upset my sleep. tonight my social life. we have two minutes. my dinner guests are waiting.
it is entirely up to you.  i want the best.
and then you...
you're joking --
yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. that's the old maintenance grid, doc. swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
i speak english.
and this is your club.  great club.  i really love it here.  great club.
i didn't tell them to come. tommy como...
i'm not afraid. i'm just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
uhh - martini?
run it then.
helena, please.  this is out of your hands.
i'll get rosasharn.
come on, say it.  you know...
a what?
uh, yeah. does she have big hooters?
i didn't do it. i didn't do it.
nothing's going on.  maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  he's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
yeah, i think you sounded pretty good.
janet!  oh!  yes it's alright.  janet. everything's going to be alright.
i told you.  it's a useless talent.
do you know where the adagio begins?
it's all my fault. oh god. i wish i were dead.
you're kneeling on my hand.
i am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
that's the core: the gravity drive. the heart of the ship.
it isn't the fourth dimension. to you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
blame...
tonight we open new doors.
nods again.
richard travers.
that's okay. live a little, learn a little.
i thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
this is where you're heading. a cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. do you really want that?
i'll say.
at sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. she is brought to the duke…orsino.
nah. i'll be around, red, just back in the field.
well! i'm not talking about mac. he hasn't toughed me for ages. and not often ever. my life started when mac went on nights.
well, i guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
i know, man. i love this table too.  but i also love my wife.
it's what i deserve.
we're all on the same hajj now.
oh, leave me alone.
what's to like?
do you always ask so many questions?
i'll listen one more minute.
what about isabelle?
because i like you so much.  now i've got to go.
it was the best thing i ever been to, miss johnson!
i have to go...
he doesn't speak english.
me too.
how long will it take?
will you come here?
a recent acquisition. we’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. an easy living indeed, mr lombard.  i got through to moreau and jane. i left your landlord out of it. your flat’s been broken into. jane wants you to call her back.
you're not, as you americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
sure.
but it's romantic.
what made you ask such a question?
yeah. i guess i do.
does it feel like a boy?
yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  you've got family and they've got clout.  with we it's different... with me...
tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  twelve minutes.
excuse me?
yah?
what do they have in there that's so valuable?  a cure for aids, a cure for cancer?
that's all you have to say?
understanding the following rights...
since when?
you flew before?
you a scorpion? that's it. you're a scorpion. i can tell.
if you go, i go.
how did you get in the house?
i know. the one who phoned. your old college chum, elster.
you want to crawl, crawl.
what were you going to say?
he's sulking again.
but will he be house-trained?
who?
not often, but it is possible. most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. they don't know how long the shadow really is. they don't know how far away the real limits are standing... they stop out of fear.
i trusted you.  i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you.
thank you.
yeah, i think so...
we were due to go back out on the same ship. six months of tests.  if you were married you got a state-room.  otherwise it was bunks.
why young girls, walter?
a half hour in the lobby.
what post office?
wait a minute, wait a minute. she's unconscious?
did he ask you to take your clothes off?
then let's go talk to her.
great.  i'll see you at the office at nine.
... but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. and it is certainly not cia policy.
yes.
sort of.  we used to come here summers when i was kid.  now we're here on a permanent basis.
bill, you know how much i do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
bear with me here...
let's go in.
it's ok to ask that.
what we're doing is kicking ass.  for god's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews.  the war is over.  we've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
miss gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
of course.  he was in great danger of harming himself.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?  what the fuck're we gonna tell lebowski?
you should be dead.  how do you feel?
what are you talking about?
i understand.
i'm waiting till the time's right.
god damn son of a...
please don't play governess, karen, i haven't your unyielding good taste, i wish i'd gone to radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  i'm being rude now, aren't i? or should i say "ain't i"?
she used those words. look, i doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
sometimes. i'm in divorce, mainly. some property. some personal injury.
let's talk about you.
you should have gone to china. i heard they give away babies like free ipods. they shoot 'em out of those t-shirt guns at sports events.
good morning, gru -- your --
you are seriously deranged.
if he lets you get close enough.
your secret admirer?
he'll survive.
i got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
i don't want to do something anybody can do.
i wish i didn't love you so much.
terminate with extreme prejudice.
have you guys seen jeffrey?  the limo never showed, i thought he might be here.
don't bullshit me.
who the hell would you call?
working with a dead man. shit, i've done about everything else.
this is gonna be cool! huh huh huh.
look at him go. bam! bam!
you want to go to a movie tonight?
half and a dollar.
make time, okay?  you're the one who told me to act normal.  i've missed three practices already.  if i'm not there for the barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
what else is new?. right?
oh, as beautiful as ever.
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal. you've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters i never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. and now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  in your eyes, that's power.
baby, i didn't --
i know.  that was for the smell.
dad, you and i have talked about this.  lloyd and i have talked about this.  believe me, this is well-covered territory.
yeah. kinda. anyway, once i have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, i can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
doesn't need to be. use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes, stick out a thumb. you'll get picked up.  right?
but you --
i never lied.  i may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
lemme go!  lemme go!!
yeah, i know bill, i came up with the plan remember?  just have those hangar doors open and ready, i can take it from there.
i'm in construction.
car pool?
i can't believe the captain went along with a memory download.
yes, comrade?
yeah. that warehouse over on merchant street. the volume on our import business has risen dramatically. the proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
how do you do?
what's so stupid about it?
i guess there's always a chance.
sixty-nine cent.
ever so nice. aren't you, jimmy?
but...wait a minute!
no.
i am?
going home, yeah.  i told them what you said...
he's drunk.
hi.  i know you!  i've seen you down at the jabberjaw plenty.
it's undamaged?
oh, i wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. so i threw them out!
you are?
cynthia, i think you're laboring under a misconception. you seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. we're not. anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. i want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. remember this was your baby.
i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
so it would seem.
i swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff i think i ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  rafe was...he was lonely.  he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
fuck, yeah!  i told you so.  and you can tell'em all i told you so.
seems too coincidental that way.
... but he's...?
'bout fourteen miles this side of mississippi.
well we can definitely call the police. that's an easy call. if we call the police...what happens?  they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...they ask us...what happened? we say, ah...our friend, micheal...  your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  isn't that how the saying goes?
sorry, little man.
you're not working at random house, i talked to them.
so do you.
presumed dead.  no one knows.
downstairs.  there must be an extension.  oh my god --
lloyd, i want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
i can't see anything--she's too bright!
shut up! where’s your wallet?
i believe he believes him.
not out the other side his face, though.
pardon me?
were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
what kind of bomb was it?
thanks, al. we'll be all right.
sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
he could have killed him! okay? he could have killed him.
what?
no shit.
mantan?
wrong. i've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty hail mary's since i saw you. hungry?
ten dollars? let's grab a highball!
where did you go to school?
yes!
the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans.  no matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. if we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  in that time we can conquer all of the pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
so do you.
yeah, well... me neither...
ready!
i'll take you to the bridge.
look, i can't help you with quincey if that's what you're after.
what's it to ya?
what?
hi.  sam?
the forest is not safe these days. you'd best travel with us.
well just so i got a quote in my head. what's the rate for the swede?
it’s just two kids, right?
d'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
but scottie, you don't have to!
i didn't say it bothered me.
what are you doing? advertising martini?
lemme tell you about history: black history. you listening?
fix raft first.
when he uses a phrase like "i am happy", i think we should think twice about what we ask him.
and whatever you sensed out here....
what are you talking about?
i'll protect you, dollface.
he fell out.
well, i can't let you down now, can i?
it's all we've got.
but-but, but how about you?  do you, do you share any of my feelings? or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
it's me. what is it?
it's to follow my instincts. and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge.
there will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
your spanish is good enough. you certainly look the part.
i'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. glass the planet !
watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
why was it you never took her by force?
on you, maybe.
but you are taking it?
marty, what are you doing here?
shit.  think we're had.
chemco's been developing nerve gas?
are you busting my chops or what?
i think --
i had to tell someone. he put it into perspective.
datura.
some french guy. at least that's what his passport said. you know joey, i shouldn't be talking to you about this.
yeah.  i'm ghosting pretty bad.
why don't we try the giga-meter?
we have that taken care of.  you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. no one, you hear?
sleep 'n eat, what do you do?
there's no need for language, mr. hockley.  go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
okay.
how's he get around out here?
but you can't.
i meant did you find other stuff to --
get on with it, counselor!
i didn't see you.
i never said i didn't.
fill 'er up.
me.
that's it.
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
it'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, brad.  we'll cover it the way the "hickville gazette" covers the church social!  the names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  i tell you, brad, i envy you.  by bradford leland, the "enquirer's" special correspondent at the front. i'm almost tempted -
maurice?  from lompoc?  good god.
can you get us out? it's all a misunderstanding. we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
girls, i wanta apologize.  for my language back there.
you're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
stable.  we're looking at low twenties.  it's a good number, considering the fallout from --
i am arthur, king of the britons.
sorry, sir.
they'll be up there in a half hour.
500? sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
all the more reason to eliminate him.
staring at us?
and you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
dad--if my curveball is hanging, god ain't gonna help me.
i know.  you're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
into what? a lampshade?
i did alright.
addison, won't it be just perfect? lloyd and i - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, i'll make them be great!  you're the only one i've told, the only one that knows except lloyd and me...
let's try this way.
maybe soon--
huh?
mars.
this wasn't what i had in mind, nyah.
mummy!
now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, i suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "stabilize -- all clear."
honey.  nothing's impossible.  you just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  maybe he was askin' for it.  anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' harlan.
yes, under "u.s. government." now we need directions.
how's that?
you do?
... well, we did do the nose.
you think he's for real?
i think he'll be in bartlett's one day.
yes.  money.  which is what, george?
eddie and tinker died.
you stay offa this alphabet soup detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
sam ... we're proud to have you at information retrieval. merry xmas. 
taking my pleasure.  do i need to clear my lovers with you?
give me your gum and grab the wheel.
okay... thank you.
no, i really don't.
what?
nexus designated mary:  incept november 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
unless what?
susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  rachel?
that is why they call it coach?
come again?
just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. keep moving and file on out when you're through.
honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  don't get in an uproar.
tell me what?
it will happen, laurie.  i've already seen it.  neither of us can do anything to change it.
man, you have got to get some therapy.
it's a mask.
one cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--douglas points. one medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret, or work, or that i'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but i'm not.  i'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but i can't. it seems very funny to me.
yes, sir. but this -- creature is a special case.
but you couldn't have been, could you?
this is colonel richards.
jiminy christmas.  what do you want from me?
she ain't crazy. she love those children. she was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
you smashed it!
nobody cares about me at home. they wouldn't even miss me.
it's better that way.
i'm not... bobby i'm gonna need some more stuff. i mean it. i'm out.
stop -- singing!!!
that was -- oh, shit. what if he's on his way over there?
this is my place and you can't have it.
i'm at mile marker...
you'll leave -- ?
you know, i've always been fascinated by show business.
meet me at the starlight motel on sycamore... i'll be there in twenty minutes.
yes. each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. never in the same place twice.
on what basis?
what 'look'?
no, wordsworth .. do you like poetry?
sure, lenny.  the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
roki has a vivid imagination.
sure, whatever. maybe i'll catch a movie.
i really should get home...
i've got to get ray to o'hare...  come on, let's hustle...  john!  call american express in pittsburgh for mr. morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
it's a wonderful piece.  emotional. i love it.
why, jack, then tis your death song i'll be strumming.
there's no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.
but of course you are.
you goddamn bitch!
there is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. from there it infects our dreams. our thoughts. grigory gave us a glance tonight --
great.  you know what?  i'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before i start screaming my head off.
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now? because i am.
yes, but very well.
you don't know anything about me.
i know where it is.
oh. i guess you got the whole story.
hey, i saw that movie. true story, 'bout some killer in texas.
i see, your excellency.
then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
this tree is strong with the dark side of the force.  a servant of evil it is.  into it you must go.
that's what i've been trying to tell these people.
he didn't know. no one doing the deal knew except a few key people. this guy says they were real hush about it. whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
you promised to give it back.
yes.
i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.
you know he's a little dog. next time, if bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
no.
listen to me.  i don't want sex.  just give me the address and then you go.
i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at least he had a chance to give you the ring.
you go back, you won't be alone. you'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  you're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. depressing.
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
this was one sadistic motherfucker.
then he will die!
less than you would guess.  most days two to three assistant d.a.'s. a handful of police investigators.
i mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
for now that's all.
i was the lesser of two evils.
no, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
i don't know what you're talking about?
no. but tell him i would.
yes... leaving immediately.
cool.
my grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so i would come over and ride all the time.
figured you did.
what does that mean? you don't have any tomatoes?
bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
no jeremy.
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, jerry.  it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over.  but seriously, jerry, people aren't interested in jim garrison - they want the hard evidence!  they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
that's nice, stan.
what?  what, that guy?
yes, he's very bright, dear. much like his father. but you know, calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
talk?  about what?
must i? well, i won't! i tell you straight: i will not!
what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces? he committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
you don't know he did it.
no no no no no no no no no find me the money...
are you threatening me?
life is a burden for me.  nothing gives me any pleasure; i find only sadness in everything around me.  it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
what are you talking about?
nuh-huh ...
easy? no... we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
i told you i'm looking for someone.
i'm certainly not.
yeah, well i don't blame him.
yeah...i remember.  i used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
decent?  i guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
i'm not on the tour this year.
sure have...
gimme one anyway.
so?
yeah - it's all right... let's go.
mr. henry?
einstein, right?  we'll see ya.
this?
why is it moving?
best game in the world.
how?
that kid's name was jim marshall.
yes and no. did you recognize him?
lloyd was such a gentleman.  he was funny and nervous and strange, and i met people that i never would have met before, then i blew it.  i called him basic.  can you believe i did that?
keep talkin', preacher.
why would i care where you're going.
so what's the deal, huh? go into l.a., find the president's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and i'm free?
want to go? let's go back in.
jesus.
we will be fine!
hey, mutch!  you want bacon?
dad around?
the ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...i was one of a group of...
somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it. actually, i didn't think about it at all, really.
forget about it, doesn't matter.
why?
ok and one of them  jane mckenna -- she blows a little jealous of bree - you know? -- bree comes first? and evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to bree, you know, so bree'd get hurt. i didn't know. till afterwards.
you analyze everything out of existence. you analyze me out of existence. i won't let you. love is not so simple. ninotchka, ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? why do flowers open their petals? oh, ninotchka, ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
how do we do that?
but not to last.
you are the dumbest person in the world.
look, why don't you just call diane again?
i can't think any more, unless it's about you.  i'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, i think about how you look when you smile.  remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard?  ever since my wife died i've been...  i've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
how long would their shields be down?
sshhh! he's in there.
where has it been for the last seven years?
credit?
i'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and i'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. i'm so excited to finally have some free time. we have to get together this summer!
boy scouting.
ask if he can check how many sick days i've taken since i've worked here?
something like that. but i'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
that's why my wife adores me.
mrs. connelly. i'm martin bettes ...  dr. bettes.
okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  d'you mind?
george.
these are fishermen, alvin.  they don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  specially gossip.
i live or i die.
establishing a perimeter. making it safe. these guys are really good. one of them was a green...
you know, buddy, sometimes i can't figure you out at all. you can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
oh, i suppose you is a doctor, homer?
i'm fired?  because i let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
fuck you! i told you i never saw him before!
i saw it.
have you played the game yet?  it's incredible!  i was just...
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
i don't know. but all i know is that i kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
what's he doing here?
that doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
they gave up...went back to the cotton rows...so'd the jamisons... without martha, i don't know...she wouldn't let a man quit.
honey, i'm sure he's around. you'll find him.
do one thing to me?  get me one shot at anchoring the weekend news -- they've never seen me do it.  i think it could turn them around.
call me later, hon.
do you want to talk to  zoe?
he's doing the same thing you did to him, playing letterman on tv.
the high command? our high command?
they're still there!
how come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  john <u>wilkes</u> booth. mark <u>david</u> chapman.  lee <u>harvey</u> oswald.
when in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
don't tell rowan about this.
donnie... it's friday. shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
to save us work on the spring plowing?
cheer up, man.  half this money is ours. we're fucking rich.
no.  look, we're kind of....
no.  i mean it, thank you.
yup.
that's what i thought.
go on to the next question.
i don't want it this way.  i wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but i can't let you lose the gold for me.  not when we're so close.
darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
so isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
come here.
i shivved him.
go ivan!!
just come on, i've got an idea.
we'll see.
how much can you lift?
well, there's got to be a way...
you're brill.
control, this is enterprise requesting permission to depart.
i want to ask you something.
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert? alone?
i'm fine--but thank you.
fishing! duckshooting! how do you like that. a guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected governor and right away he thinks he's tarzan!
they're not talking to me.  saks looks right through me.  i ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  condescending bastard.  helen, on your lists to call is san quentin.  daryll lee cullum?
well ya know, delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. yep, it's like our friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. but don't worry, delmar; he'll be back on top again. i don't think we've heard the last of george nelson.
i'm not afraid of his words.
did you call someone you knew?
okay.
and how do you suggest i do that?
and i have no idea why.
nothing. two nights later i was robbed. i'm pretty sure they were pros.
you <u>are</u> the first woman i'm going out with.
i can't sleep.
there's the fence...
uh, no -- i've never really found the time to settle down.
hunh-uh.  what's that?
please look at me. you must believe me -- you must believe that i love you -- that i have never known what love is -- until last night. 
well, bye. she laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
you're not going to tell me that.
if there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
oh.  i better get some spackle.
mr. wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
i...i wasn't thinking.  i just did it.
we should get her out of here...
stu, are you...feeling okay?
nobody.
yaay!
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
it is?
audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
just some local pinot, you know, then a little burgundy. that old cotes de beaune!
big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
the guy you killed was an off duty cop!  if you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  they have a new thing called radar. maybe you've heard of it.
you do? boys, you're aiming low. you not only surprise, but you grieve me.
what's it to ya?
hey, terry, i'm hit.
well... can't i play the romantic part?  i'm tired of always being the bad guy.  you know, back in hungary, i played romeo!  i would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
then, you kiss his ass.
transmit image of the alien to starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
what's a triac?
of course it happened. why would i lie about it?
isn't there something called group hysteria?
tell him.
yes sir...
as long as it gets us out of here
naw, it ain't like that.
okay...
yes, of course.  there's nothing to worry about.
do you accept anyone of the jewish persuasion?
you got my note!
you're bad.
lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
really?  congratulations, by the way.
he's heading down the stairs, now..
in group?
the locks.
it's a shame he died prematurely...i was hoping to kill him myself.
yeah, but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here.
well i'm real happy for you, cobb. but i think i'll keep looking for mine.
stay and listen!  besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. this is no time to go to bed.
don't hate me, trinity.  i'm just the messenger.  and right now i'm going to prove it to you.
figured it was something like that.
what did they do to you?  tell me!
3:30 i guess.
well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  only when it was funny.
it's all right.
no. i couldn't do that. i have something for you.
had a letter from my wife.  the wisteria is still out, which i'm looking forward to.  she says dorset is gripped with invasion fever.  wrong coast i should have thought, still…
that's what i'm here for--to get out! i want to get away from here, from you--as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  sixty-five, ninety-four--
very good. very good. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.
what.
i'm the emancipated type. real emancipated.
how come?
you're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that george viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
why? i like spending time with you. you know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. you have killer legs. killer.
i'm sure.  if i were you, i would use this time, to think about my life.  and its direction.  or lack thereof.
well... sure.  she will have the seafood salad special. and i will have... the same.
right. little twerp thinks he's colombo.
agent chase, does it appear that they are heading for mexico.
wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
okay, sonny.
no one's perfect, kate.
charged. receiver?
yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
what two?
you sound like the tourists. know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  fuck you.  you won't make it off this mountain.
not really.  i figured ganz was put down for a long time.  and i knew luther would never job me on his own.  he's too chickenshit.
gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
oh.  you're them.
i got lured.
oh my god.
i am.  i'm a pretty boring guy.
maybe if i --
until now.
definitely.  colson had him trying to break into bremer's apartment after bremer shot wallace, to plant mcgovern campaign literature.
last month you wanted to play the violin. then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
show them one interesting modulation and they faint. ohime! morbidezza! morbidezza! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
we didn't miss anything.
what?
what?
implicitly.
this denny's.
you're always so coarse... "do her right here." let's just see what happens, okay?  "i wish that i could find a way; to speak my thoughts on mother's day. there are no words that quite express; my gratitude or happiness. a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; i would not fail to give her this. i'd make her glad the whole day through; by sayin' 'mother', i love you!' p.s. i wish i could say this to my mother's face, but i can't anymore."
the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass i'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  the only people who i've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them; an m-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  now if you'll excuse me, soldier, i'd like to get back to my box.  i've got a treasure to find.
i've been looking all over for you. you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
morning painless. how they goin'?
i hear you...  partner.  and la's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
found them?  in mercea.  the coconut's tropical!
you really enjoy yourself, don't you?
i didn't think so.
i'm sorry, i'm in a real hurry.  see you around, pal.
are you crazy?
i told you! i've got everything!
nick!
grace. i'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim, if you feel up to it.
people are pretty cagey.  who do you know?
do you want to take a quick swim?
it is.  only the poorest families ever ate it.  we kept ours in a crockery jar.
please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
first time i ever heard that.
mom, we already...
do they have the report? have you discussed it with them?
sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. the evidence of every scam we ever pulled. the evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
the candelabras were my gran's.
yup--sweeney, flood, farrell--waiting for you--
yes, my aunt. but perhaps she wept a little. tell me how you love her, will.
and where is she?
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  but he knew right and wrong.  oh, and we kind of messed around...
good to see you, diego.
just what i had in mind.  everything dead on earth except us.  a chance for mother nature to start again.  plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  sorry hon, this is for science.  behold the dawn of a new age.
honest?
we leave it.
no, it's a prophecy. the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians didn't have unions.  i know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. he don't give a damn about northstar or us ...
it was...  ...one of them!
her favorite poet.
you didn't have to shoot him, bo. we coulda just beat him up some.
if i had everything i need, i wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
no. he's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. he can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
what about that d.b. cooper guy?
i didn't say i remembered killing him. i just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
why would we do that?
i'm tired of praying.
you want to take a look at my car? i think the radiator hose is--
is he going to see this?
you know my back.
you do not know all that has happened.  you cannot understand.
how was your date?
thanks.
if we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes.
he's gone to dinner! search the place. i can't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you.
so you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
...nine seconds...
he's staying at the hotel i've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. must've seen us.
sure.
i counted four.
xxxxxx
tell me what i am, rowan.
hey, wait a minute!
you're welcome to one.
you're wrong.  i didn't know.
now?  why not tomorrow?  after the show.
what?  no kiss?  not even for old times sake?
i must find the means to save him, then. i was hoping i could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
really?
don't rush me, sonny. you rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. you got money?
hello! . . . yeh?
haven't had so much fun since live tv.
fuck this shit! i ain't dyin' in no white man's war! ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
i don't know.
yeah?  what about the other five guys?  the five before me?  what about them?
i don't know.  big.  dark.
if it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
it's a tradition.
they found prints at blue legs' place.
and i'll never understand terrorists.
you'll never understand. me and you, wayne, we're not even the same species. i used to be you...then i evolved. from where you're standing, you're a man. from where i'm standing, you're a ape. i'm here...i'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. you say why? i say why not?
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away siwash ridge. i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
why?
you never lose a gift like that.  you just forget how to use it.  how about it?  will you try?
there are others.
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
rich? i have an inheritance. it's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. that's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. this is what i'm doing with that money. i could have done anything i wanted. i could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
american currency.
- inauguration balls -
in his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
you said nobody would miss her.
what did you find out?
well, no. i'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
i'm okay.
you can still work.
was there anyone with you last night?
out front.
you see the lever on the green box? upper right hand corner?
no, no.
all the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  kent, i bet you didn't know i won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
what what's about?
i think i just broke my hand.
okay, we need wallpaper paste.  hey cece!
yes, i'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him.
gunner's mate, third class -- l. johnson, sir.
why?
ninety-six.
thou hast most kindly hit it.
bingo.
- and you got to be girls.
very good, chief. chief guard turns to alex.
that's right.
that sounds like a curse to me.
say, ni...
i'm not sure i'd be good company tonight.
no, i'm divorced.
no, he didn't make me touch it.
do what? i don't know. i'm no good at this.
honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
i told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
i can hear her. oh mother of god, i can hear her.
nothing! i'll be out in a minute!
let my daughter rest in peace.
just let me tell you how it begins.
why did you phrase it like that?
she's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
is there a problem?
what's that for?
check.
and if nothing's lacking?
i've got a <u>name</u>.  it's <u>z</u>.
haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
you're getting warmer.
he was, he's just as crazy as ever. he was on his way to get a blood test. 
never happened!
dr. argon, i demand an explanation.
a what?
keep going west. last building before the river.
it was warm.  i was outside.  the ocean?
we'd travel north, my bride and i. to the furthest reaches of the pole, where no man has ever set foot. there we would live out our lives. together.  no human eye would ever see us again. this i vow.
sorry.
sure, sure.
you should go on a trip.
they didn't have a leg to stand on. there's no case against me. it's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
no, sir.
captain howdy.
deductive reasoning, my friends! that's the name of the game. what does it say here?
you were asleep.
why, yes. they're all i need...
the important thing is not to panic.
fine.
yes, sir.
yes. i don't remember where agnes was. i was needed in the sick room.
i thought so!
i'm taking you back.
that's funny.
let me out, captain.  open the door!
something most important you can do.
oh right.  i mean, i am a friend -- i'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
oh, i worked there for a couple of vacations, but i don't know . . . i guess i was homesick.
wait. how about this?
i'm so happy for you.  takes the edge off, doesn't it?  and where might your date be?
what?
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
be quiet and listen.
they can't shoot us in here.
you are woman.  i know woman well.
too bad. i wasn't in it.
no!  there's no such thing as "just two ants."  you never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
who's mr. lindgren?
no, just a farewell appearance, batting for sweeney. i'm going into business for myself.
you fit a lot of descriptions.
thanks.
well, you better move holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
i said, do you come here often!?
no.
"the fifth one this week"!
just a boy. he's picking me up this morning.
did you think i could just leave you...?
whatever you say, man.  i didn't see shit.  the safe combination is 34-5-27. just take it all.
yeah, what happened?
well, i'm carrying three people. and he's got only himself.
well, it pretty much speaks for itself. peter, you want to run with it?
yes, lovebirds. we couldn't let you...
till today, i haven't believed a word.  now, i'm curious.  six months, eleven days.  i'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  where to?
quietly.
thanks for reminding me..
oh, sean --
yes, well, it's probably best. no sense bringing someone else in.
no, no they know another track - to the side of this.
you'd know i wouldn't run off.
john merrick.
somewhere else?  mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  how you planning on getting it there? you gonna push this heap yourself?
yes ... yes. the problem also involves the un. i don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength.
i heard it too.
i'm not kidding, graham, you'd better do what i say. give me those tapes.
so are dogs.
michael's around someplace...
that's what i'd planned to...
have you known him long?
uh-huh.
take it easy. take a deep breath.
what?
oh, i know. she's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
bread and wine... in that cupboard.
twombley involved?
"yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim, before the blazing of a single thought -- "
plain-clothes man.  come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death.
yeah, you still with northland?
excuse me, mister... i'm looking for mister rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and i got lost...
who fired you?
wrong, dad. your idea.
where is she?
turn around.  now!
where is she?
well, it doesn't matter.   go and tell your master that arthur from the court of camelot is here.
doing what i did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. it takes it's toll. it took nine moons to get back my strength.
of course not.
yes.
kill the men who killed you both, and the day of the dead will be your reunion.
bad food, brutal discipline.  no women.
may as well go out under my own free will, right?
it's every bit as hard as they say. unless you're a genius like meeks.
i don't got no daddy, you dig? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
where is the subway station, please.
what is it?
he's like the pope. like we're gonna snake a girl away from the pope.
you use needles?
not this week.
i think you should go now.
there was none!
what do you mean, i'm here?
on screen.
hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
she's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. oh, i got rid of her, buddy, i didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. hell, she was screwin' everybody in savannah. i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
something like that.
okay, i guess.
we killed him.
to keep the daylight out! this is where they sleep! get to the door!
sure.
happy birthday, darling. ...
no. i only let her go with edward.  it's alright.
why do you hate me?  it's gotta be more than me private you, you cop.
maybe.  what's this about?
my son is out there!
hey. check this out.  look at this.
<u>am</u> <u>berliner</u> <u>zug</u>.
you're a fast mover.
wyatt earp is my friend.
he must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. when the plane landed he was dead.
-- and this is confidential?
but i'm afraid of--
learning our history! the last 5000 years that she missed! she's been out of circulation a while, you know.
are you alright?
it was the biggest i could find.
no, i - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
how can one man possibly be so selfish?
sure. what's worth doing is worth doing for money. it's a bad bargain where nobody gains. and if this deal goes through, we all gain.
okay.
you have to be experienced to do this. just wait outside. otherwise, you risk killing him.
i see.
in my bag, in the car.
the name's walter.
you liked your teachers?
recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the confederate soldier? leanin' against it. and you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'you feel it beatin' in there, lula?... get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' d'you recall that?
-- mulder! get in the car!
... cigars in bed? i broke him on that.  but the bathroom's a swamp, he wears reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
no.
she knew about it, jeffrey.  she knew you were going to try this.
oh.
tell him i'm no fool. a prison's still a prison, even with chinese silk and chandeliers.
pity.
think real hard, benjamin.
perhaps not.  you seem to have misplaced a private.  no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
that's typical.  i hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
the magic word is "please."
passed out?  can't hang, huh?  boy, i knew you was a lightweight.  passed out on one funky ass blunt.  they don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
maybe. can't really tell yet.
i was on the team at school.  i was never very good, though.
where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  it's not...
that again.
yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
who?
yes, very.  and very married.
"eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
we don't have to help anybody.
it's so beautiful!
all directions are the same here.
you can't open it yet. you have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
tell me i'm fair, as you did the hag.
not for the actions of another. no one is responsible for any actions but his own. human beings -
keep your voice down.
oh, mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
look at her.  now, wake me in an hour, i'll take over.
this is my brother-in-law, karl matuschka.
i was going to fake it.
he said he was just going up to talk to him. he said...  i want to be put on this case.
that's fine. now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention webster.
michael!
thank you.
spooky.  i'll process her.
then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
...coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
tomorrow. one year tomorrow.
how come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
i didn't tell you everything.
listen.  understand.  i'm not a military objective, reese.  i'm a person... you don't own me.
yeah?
got enough, thanks. we're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. anything like that around here?
he'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
palmdale
oh my god! adrienne?
she *did* love him!  how many women have you known?
have you ever figured they might extradite you?
up and around?  soon?
crash, i get wet just thinking about you.
no.
baryonyx?
oh no.  i really like it sometimes.  and if it weren't for him, i wouldn't have met you.
i'm totally serious!
yeah...
no offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
you talk to him?
well, one day i'm invited skiing, the next day i'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. you tell me.
my daddy gave me this watch.
he wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  and that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. the irvings.
you're a beast!
i only have something like sixteen weeks.
sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
you're upset about me -- i made you fight --i hate for you to fight.
tell me why...you've got to tell me...
look, this is not my field of expertise. you seem stabilized, but why take any chances? let's keep you overnight and have the staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
the purse is still at the house.
all about me...
i'm sorry. i was...busy. in the lab.
i need ...unguent.
look around, sis!  <u>she's not here</u>.  so you can stop talking to me like i'm your little boy --
i'm not hiding. i'm right here.
you're not listening.  really know what you're going to do before you do it.
of course.
it might not be far, but it's another galaxy. black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
yes.
how do i know?
leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, i can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that i flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
i have a good crew.
but it's true. take 'em up in your hands, mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  aren't you glad?
well... we're not in kansas anymore.
i didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
double.
maybe luther hopes ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
no argument there.
for what?
then what else can we do?
drugs? god, no! i'm totally against drugs.

world history.  but, i'll see you in the morning, right?
i wanted to thank you for covering for me. you're a real pal.

the f.b.i. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  i think he's a first- timer.
suppose our theorizing is correct? then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
good.  i'll see him in there.
i don't like to use that credit card, dignan.
why would he be frightened?
me, neither. i don't eat meat.
i know, but that was before.
so we're working?
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth's relationship?

i know.  but chances are...
you've been doing a bang up job so far. right now matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
yes!
be honest, i can't say i did it all myself. my grandma helped me get the words right.
my folks are.
what's going on between you two?
oh. uh, tape. duct tape. i...need it for... taping something. bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.

...uh-huh...
forgive me, godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. how can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  the two  go hand in hand. and with you gone from here the barzini and the tattaglias will be too strong for us.
he was dead.  he had to be dead...
yea?

they said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
yeah? if this be execution, lead me to it.
i think a little of both.

now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
hit me in the face.
too risky. we don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
why me? what do you want from me!?
can i come in for a minute?
do you have any idea what this means, simone?  our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
look.  can i pay you properly?  you don't have to tell him what you got. send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  give it to charity.  or something.
not quite. i envy the hair- line.
you wicked old witch!  uncle henry, auntie em, don't let 'em take toto!  don't let her take him -- please!
that'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
my father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man i ever knew.
i don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! she can't stay in this house forever! i fired her, damn it!
is that jango?
yeah. it's like all i think about now. not just that, it's like lately during sex, i start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
you're talking to an authority in that area.
well, thanks for your help mr. rosenfeld and i'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, i'm sure she would have had a really great time.
manual overrides aren't working.  i'm getting nothing, lieutenant.
yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? i mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
this was all for your sake, wasn't it? having me here?  trying to get me to like you.
just a coincidence?
what?
i'm going completely crazy.
my pleasure, jody
thank you.
i was afraid to ask.
but what's wrong?
no.
ah, it's just old, like me. you don't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints...i say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. but, 'long as we're here...
it comes at intervals.  they used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
you promise?
how deep does this go?
signs of the lord. they just appeared out of nowhere. i thought you were loco!
i'm not bill mitchell.
sh, sh sh sh sh.
i'm going to california.
i couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. sheila comes over to take their orders.
for more than forty years. so madame told me.
there is no conflict.
you remember the fellow this morning -- galbraith. you've got time before the supper show.
john, how's your wife this morning?
and that?
what?!  how do i do that?
six.
actually i'm feeling up to leaving.
i'll do it tomorrow.
what...
what are you going to do?  hide me?
i don't control minds. i free them.
dr. klenstein.  it's not a pleasant procedure, but if the ks is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
you know what's goin' on?
oh, i was scared of the same thing, heather. the minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
and a leader. didn't she meet castro on foreign exchange?
oh, he said rim job.  it's when someone licks your ass for-
shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
a lucas jackson.
yeah -- he really dug his playboy mag, man -- i mean like he was there when it arrived -- he just knew.
and that's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you'd thought you'd known.
thanks, but i was enjoying that dependency.
and you can depend on me, son. trust me.  whatever comes we'll face it together, i swear.
worried!
oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
stewart!
honest, i feel fine. you better be married.
what are you talking?!  he's had two months training in those choppers!
yeah, i know.
materially or spiritually?
about forever.
let's get outta here, honey.
whoa, i just...i just...
what do you do, with the money you earn?
of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  have you got that, mr. bernstein? in the opinion of this reviewer -
well, i always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  how did you know they'd get into the vodka?
has threepio turned up yet?
what're you doing with all this shit?
uh, sorry, general, i...i've always had this animal magnetism, it --
i never said that. it was just that boy--
graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
be sorry for nothing.
yes. thank you.
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. he was engineered to skip thirty years of life. but since the rna sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. he's dying.
and the, uh, the briefcase?
i can just hear you now. "get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! you're too good for me!"
i'm sorry i brought the whole thing up!  if you're gonna flip your wig --
well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
i really don't know. i don't live there. i was just visiting...a grave.
no, that's,..that's fine
we can't... stay here.  that traitor d'artagnan... knows about this place.
oh my god --
where is this cave he's talking about?
i have a phrase i want you all to memorize:  "lushu hoo megwa fugi."  it means "i am an american."  in chinese.
it's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  look, look, look, she's telling us.
you two are majorly demented. anyone ever tell you that?
i can quote it fully, mrs. redi. "we will avoid violence. for once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
you ever try to run in high heels?  you probably did.
you're not a moron.
what?
it's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. not a tenable position, sir.
i was about to throw in the towel.
just better.
well, we'll do that this weekend.
hello, jason.  i think i've had a change of heart.
this money is evidence.
thanks for the help.
no. i'm just not tired. let's go.
gilbert!  is he here too?  we might as well be living in the lobby.
you what?.. what are you talking about?
it's about atlanta and birmingham.
give me some narco skinny.  i want to put out an all hop-head issue. shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  maybe tie it into the rosenbergs.  you like?
i'm not sure... i don't think isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
i should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
"my parents are right upstairs! they think you've left..."
she's right.
yes esther.
you will have this baby. if you want it. if you don't, i can stop it now.
yes.
you gonna get married.
yeah, yeah, never mind.  you gotta be careful.
take it.
i'm glad you like it.
she's very beautiful.
let's lift up her shirt.
a proud tradition.
leave the pills. i'll take them later.
no!  don't go.
sure i do.  you heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what edvard said.
why?
a princess?
no, don't!
then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the asylum's equipment- test list. maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "saturation chamber."
they can't be serious.
well, remember, its leathery magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
it's a shame, reverend. it's a damn shame.
oh, you've noticed it, too?
doug, i can't just leave you!
yes.
has this ever happened before?
of course.
if you will forgive me, ever since you met that bolshevik lady i've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
i understand, but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you.  is this somehow related to the fire department?
you know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
that's so weird...
he was murdered.
the girl worries me. if she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. you seem to certain she's dead.
roger.
i said i thought it was in the rolltop desk.
you are forgiven. goodbye.
mr. spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. you're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
very well then.
a meeting tomorrow on the tgv, enroute to paris.
you know how i felt about her.
it was implanted by the agency.
i won't be at the office except to sign in.  i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.  i'll come home right after work.
so what'd this guy do? snitch off a dealer?
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
hooray for me.
yeah jimmy?
i certainly was not!
and her...?
get more coffee.
yeah. yours?
i'm relaxed.
they're gonna tell their grand kids.  that telly. he sure was good in the sack!
you don't get it, he's after me...
okay.  you didn't like the party, huh?
uh - right. sure. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.
oh, mr. martins...
we should just do it.
you're forty-two years old, johnny, and mama is still running your life.
ah, history i think.
i had no idea until after, but --
i'll watch for him, sir.
actually, diz, i promised carmen...
i don't know.
you're being childish.
you're saying i have no choice.
how was it?
because you're going to bed. i don't think i should be up here.
i will.
i think we should go straight. i mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
i wouldn't say so if i didn't.
peter...
yes.
look, thank you for this but--
he was a good man. now his wife is a widow.
jon!  get back!  you don't understand.
like what, sir?
yeah?
a soap?
i almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
on a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
there's something i want to talk with you about. it's...well, we.. i...
uh...
oh no!  no!  i can't believe it.  i can't believe it.  both of them, both brothers, oh my god!
somebody shut his lights. i guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
well, we were once. you know, that time.
oh, i am happy, harold. ecstatically happy. i couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
did you find him attractive?
what's that? what is that that you're doing?
jesus, just what i need, another blue flamer.  johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
no one really knows that they've seen it. but they did.
so why don't you just ask him for the money?
i'm right here, dad.
think about what you're going to say, ed; we are on thin ice.
yes, they do.
yes. you've made yourself quite clear.
you want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...
garcetti thinks everything is shit. he doesn't even like dolphins.
you know where i been.  i been on vacation.
well...i suppose penetrate the base by force.
you're not going to notify my father, are you?
let it go.
you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom.  every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away.  dad?
yes.
she most certainly was not!
same here. you can retire my number.
it's not ignorant.
bad. she couldn't make the trip. you know her boy...  susan told us before we got your letter. she's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
it's impossible. it's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  it's...
but he won't shoot you right then?
impersonally.
frank? .can you stand up?
of course i'm on it.
i do not.
out.
that's a movie, you moron.
a transport.  so are they coming or are we going?
we can't spare the personnel.  we've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  that's why chaz left us on board.
we're not on the pier yet -
yeh?  who else?
back up!  back...
stanzi!
...polacks...
tempura...
no one would ever have to know its not him.
no.  i can not just step aside and let you escape.
you bet i will, ma.
didn't ... ahhh...look good.
in fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. you've just sworn to that.  isn't that right?
i am so glad to meet you.  we are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...i, you know, they had c...i'm, <u>yearly</u> i redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
i locked the door!  get out!  i locked the door!  get out!
most of it.  i just hate to see you in this situation.
dissent?
what do they want?
does that mean that the bath is my own? --- private?
what you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
a new pediatric wing at the hospital? a presidential campaign? name it. anything.
shells and lobsters and stuff?
please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
i have to reach him. this is an emergency. could you give me his home number?
my man, i speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. i've been giving this one a lot of thought, and i believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
yes, mine. i'm going to have one.
it's over.  i talked to her this morning.
i'm sorry, eddie.  i'm so sorry.
now don't be absurd, smith—  may i come in?
you know them personally?
sir, dunbar, sir!
why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
what the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
hi.
three, four thousand...i don't know.  the guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
wait!  how are you going to know they're all following it?
yes.
let's go.
the enemy. who else?
it's ok if you are.
i thought it was appropiate.
i don't want to run short.
yeah?
how's mom?
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight.
but i had to. it was the only way to get to you --
that's because i wanted them to!
it's nice to see you again.
oh i love to cook. i guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but i believe you should trust your instincts. when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... i don't know... harmless. ready for ice cream?
i thought you were asleep.
it wasn't very good last night, was it?
are you alright?  did they hurt you?
it doesn't matter how.  i was driving a stolen car--
heart. give magua new heart.
you came underground when the world was ending above.  and you evolved. some into the morlocks and others --
i shouldn't be. we made great progress today. i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. he did rather well, too, but i had to lead him every step of the way. though frankly, at times i was unsure of who was leading whom.
yes.
aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
what would it take to buy our stock back?  name your price.
...you don't have to come in...
that money is my whole future.
the slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
yes.
me, sir?
j.j. gittes. and it's not a departmental matter.
i'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. i think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
the american theater doesn't need people like that.
you must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
you mean you bring other girls up here?
i'll say.
when you return please extend my regards to mr. maranzano and his family.
daryll lee cullum?  i don't think so.  if he's escaped we'd have the national guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  you'd have a guard on your front door.
so... the university of kentucky. who runs the program down there?
yeah. the graduation dance mr. hand. it's the last school event of the year.
i think you're swell company, knott.
no, it's not... fuck fuck fuck fuck.
yes.  and i don't want anybody to steal it from me.
yes, of course, uriah. i feel his evil presence.
ooh, well excuse me.
uhura, i had the strangest dream. i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise.
maybe you should be.
...i believe mr. sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully.
so.  i receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  no worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
he's a very unusual android.
i'd love to have a baby. but i can't...
sir, yes, sir. breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and i asked him to show it to me, sir.
make it our first date.
i know.
no you can't, jen! it's a new tv. it doesn't work without a remote.
lemme guess.  the lottery.
gopher, everett?
is he all right?  is he all right?
hey, bud.
are you kidding?  he'll piss himself with joy.  he's the ultimate kiss ass.
i can't sleep.  my beds lumpy.
oh...
gimme an hour.
see you later.
hold on! no fuckin' way! you fuckin' notish ish? i got fuckin' shot inna faish! i went'n gotta fuckin' money! i get shot fuckin' pickin' it up!  i been up for thirty-shiksh fuckin' hourzh! i'm takin' that fuckin' car! that fuckerzh mine!
where are you from originally, annie?
listen to me i --
well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
i think he got a little scratch, mother.
don't get up.  and don't act as if i were the queen mother.
oh yeah. oh that's load off. i thought everybody gone crazy.
okay. go ahead. i'll settle up for the beers...  an' walk rayette over with you, will you.
stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; stage three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three. please watch closely.
i'm not dead!
look! i don't feel bad about it. i just feel ill.
sir... i guess i do, sir.
are you sad, bill?
you and 'honey'?
just play one set of downs. i told them you were great.
hate that.
oh -- good. and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger? and thinner?
oh. what are you talking about for christ sake! did you see her or not? she's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
those guys bother you?
he's drawing an isthmus... he's saying we're on an isthmus.
i keep explaining.  you've got the wrong man.  my name is bellini - antonio bellini.  bellini, caravaggio, both painters, i think that is confusing you.
no need.  guards' station's right there.
no you don't.
right...because every ant's important!
...soon as he finishes his thesis.
you mock us with a smile?
'cause that's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty. they think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. ya get no respect... i gotta use a bad word -- whore. you'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
oh... um, william.
okay.
so have i--i can get it right out of my trunk.
i never did.  or the whole idea of an afterlife.  but i don't know any more.  i have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway.  so what is that? it's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
yes, absolutely. is there a ballet in figaro?
shari, i really like you...
yes, he does.
no. please. they're going to arrest you.
well, then... i hope we don't run into any tonight.
not exactly.
for godsakes, jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person.
if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic.
well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  wait. here it is. yep. surgical removal of two moles. tissue was benign.
good, good.  and your sister... catherine -- she's still your best friend?
i don't know yet, doctor. and i won't know until i test it.
no!!!!!
i allowed it to escape the city.
it seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  they don't use women anymore.
i want you guys to adopt the buglet. i wanted everything to be perfect. not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. listen, once i have the baby, vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. believe me on this one!
good idea.
no. i'm good.
i don't know.
i'm telling you it's not that.
me still. they left you alone?
yeah, i guess so. i'm real tired, you know that. a kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
it helps if you don't think of them as human.
czar peter gave it to his wife, catherine the great. for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
sure.
what about me?
take it easy. what's goin' on anyway? why are you in so much trouble?
very nice mitchell turns.
fine. be that way. jim morrison.
there's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
yes. and believe me, of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. but none of the other mothers are able to go.
fuck you, man! where's jerry? i gave simple fucking instructions -
no, thanks.
yesterday.  they're back.  haven't seen them for a few months.  i have to be careful.
you aren't angry with me?
hurting.
i'm giving her an assignment.  i am offerring you a choice.  if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  if not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  your like will be destroyed.
what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than --  come on, sandman.
i'm gonna hate it.
fifty minutes.
there are no twos, max.
who gives a fuck what you think?
and the problem is you only got three.
what now what? now nothing.  she passed the polygraph.  that's it.
and when is the next lesson?
just go around him.
the king can do no wrong!
it's our pleasure.
you're the faggot.
i can't.
yeah, right.
hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
who?
thank you, trubshaw ...
why, you sweet kid.
yes, ma'am.
alas indeed, for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
i broke up with my roommate -- he was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
... a person.
any reports about monsters, people in halloween masks, anything like that?
watch this.
when you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. cause that's what the white man wants you to do. look at you.
if we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
well try this one on for size. i think i'm falling in love with you.
<u>fuck</u> them!  now get your head in the game, phil--we have to handle this.
four cases in three years...
wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...do you think i'm your father?
then why does she act so dumb?
what's happening?
yeah.
tibet, at war? no. china is close, america is far away. after countless people die, china would still, always, be close. we will work with what we have.
yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
who are you?
yes!  i was abso-- and...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
salina, kansas!
horny as shit. flopping around like a landed trout.
it didn't bite me.
okay--now you listen to me ...  you're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
dmitri <u>gusunov?</u> what the fuck, why? forget about dimitri, feds are all over him.  they're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
unpack nothing.  i didn't say i was staying.
fuck!
logan-5... francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. intrusion accidental.
the motorcycle gang?  don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
come on, day, try it.  for moms.
no, i wanna kill my boss!
i'll testify, sir.  i'm not afraid to do what's right.
go where, ray?
we've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  it must be!
i'm going to throw up.
no it's not okay. it's not.
yes, we call them that too.  ahhh, here we are, lovebirds... 
look, your trespassing.
okay.  take me to your leader.
you will or you won't.  don't look to me.  i'm going to sleep.
honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  i tried --
but even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. you won't even know it's happened.
it was too dark, daddy.
you're being narrow-minded.
i'm losing my faith in humanity.
i don't care.
why the change? what about your work?
have we been invited?
and likewise.
that's nice.
at anything. at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. if you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
yes i have - so bad i wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
calm yourself, nurse.  scotty, get us out of here!
and what, you'll shoot me? hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, i'd like to make retirement in one piece.
you print pictures of bigfoot!
where will you live?
oh, um, like famous quotes. i find reading them inspirational to me. and in my reading i've come across some i thought you might like, too.
you thought, willa, that the moment you walked in that door i'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. ain't that right, now?
i don't...  i don't... geez, i don't know, i've... i wa- this... yeah, i got this vw out there...  what a jerk, yeah. would you like a lift?
you know what he mean, dude.
i'm having a stroke.
it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
mr. lipnik, please –
an ape ... some kind of ape.
i can look at dead things.
'didn't mention he was going to the justice department?
sure...sure, colonel.  now look, i'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  right?...hello? ...hello?  hello?...hello?...gee, it must be edad. probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods... so... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
now. i'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that drs. towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed...?
what?
doesn't matter.
oh yeah? prove it.
are you following me?

leave to carry on, sir, please?

you were never a kid.

i will.
oh, buddy, i've never had someone be so protective of me!
the place is pretty dusty.
he fixes the cable?

what is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
i don't know. i've never seen any of them before. cornballs from jersey on x. feelin' the effex.
and they never proved anything against him.
you wanna commit suicide, fine! you got some death- wish, fine! but you will not drag this company down with you!
what you *have* to do is fight!
the style of fighting that tim studied didn't believe in belts.
arghhh! oh!
o-kay.  we'll skip that question.
surely you can be more specific...
in my pocket.
my wife and i had not... performed the sex act in many years.
i feel much better now...
yep. we're heading for the rendezvous right now. we get there, we pound booze till carlos shows up, he escorts us to el ray. and then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. how ya like them apples?
i am a professional man.
edie...
stellas. i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs.
it was my mother's.
colonel. is uhm--is otis in?
goddamn.
i'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  if you'll excuse me, i've got a jack vincennes press conference to prepare for.
oh, don't feel sorry for me. please. no one's forcing me to stay.
roger, i've got it.
stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
whatta you mean...
get in the goddamn room.
pretty sure or sure sure?
i've had some experience.
fuck you. i can carry it.
wonderful psychology. why don't you say something about my mom?  excuse me.
send a unit.
really.
i guess so.
dad.
good. or should i speak slower?
w.p. mayhew? the writer?
margo.  margo, i want you to know how sorry i am about this...
don't be. i'm not cut out to deal with the west's of the world.
he doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
yes, i know. hi, ho-jon. how did it go?
after your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
but sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
we were just chortling over that. blasé and epicene.  it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary. so--i hope you don't mind, edward, i pinched it for my piece today.
where are you going?
there's no secrets here, al.
all those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call bottoms, have all been changed to drives and heights. everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
hey, i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo...
to tell the truth, ever since i found my natural callin' i done time in so many small-time jails i could write a brochure...
ray --
sure, on me.  i got diner's club.
you hired someone to open it.  i'll bet the lawyer loved that.
make it ten. i am only a poor corrupt official.
hey bela, how do you do that?
what?
i took a cab.
there's explanations. rational explanations for everything that's happened. we'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
i know what you mean. after a while they all look the same.
i'm looking at you, and the whole time i can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
well, what if this guy's just playing with you? what if he's lying about who he is?
i don't have one. i don't believe in them.
like what?
i'm sorry, man -- but i ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
maybe she used another name.
we better go to doc's, see what's going on here.
what the hell's going on?
but the sword could be in his compound.
you're just reading me.
where is luh?
what's he holding?
i gave up my castles and my lands!
that's not my ring.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
hello ugarte.
stop!
i'm cooking pasta primavera.
you guys always look great.
the middle colonies?
i hate them.
i have nothing to reproach myself for. all i know is that i've changed. with all my strength, which is not much, i will follow the road that the lord has shown me. one can also serve outside a convent.
what do you think?
i'm fine.
mmnun.
so tell me more about this job. what exactly will you be doing?
she ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
a flack jacket.
will you be alone?  the merchandise. is it just you or...
bourbon and milk.
mrs. mathews?  it's thomas.  do you remember, i was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
"death at the double x ranch" - ra- a-nch.
sorry!! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. in case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and i'm the last course!!
you got the keys to the shop?
in human life? in greed? in suffering?
i am sorry, mary clarence.  i seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  good day, mary clarence.
the last i heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed's hill.  with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
you were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
hey!
but scott, who's going to take over the world when i die?
shh! just a second.
you also cut your hair short like a man, and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  it proves your desire to deceive...
oh, okay then. maybe later then.
no one. it... seemed the proper way.
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... and i always have a hard time finding one.
what?
i can't believe it.  these sound like <u>my</u> problems!
excuse me -- theresa, was it?  there are no holes in my research.
it's getting there.
how much?
no problem, mr. ullman.  i was just getting to the ice cream.
that is called a crab apple switch. it's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. now i don't know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. i was up in memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon. sure enough it was emory. my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it. got in a blues band and what not. he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town. emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. bad luck i would say. he got to drinking that corn liquor. we went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. he started talking about the old days and he went mad. he pulled his knife and i got to mine first. the lights went out.
you from around here?
how do i know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
do you have to swear all the time?
what are you getting at?
he's my father.
it got lonely upstairs. there's someone on the roof.
he was always nice to me. he found me. he saw me in his dreams.
i had no idea you were even here.
leif, you sit there. even, you sit there. harald, you'd better sit over there...
you see your office?
ginger's mad, he says things all the time and eddy's good at punching and spitting.
what are you doing?
i actually got some memory back last night.
-- to take you to jail?  it'll be my pleasure.
we were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
yes, that's why i brought it.
fine thing jim taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--i need this job like i need ten pounds.
it is, roy! and now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since i've been in the game.
i don't know what you're talking about.
sure!
yeah...pain in the neck, you know, i was all set
you're mad. why are you mad?
she's just a damn road hugger, allison.  plus the man can drive.
true.
o-o-o-okay, lee.  okay, okay.  you, you, y-you've said enough.  it's my responsibility now.  i will work things out.
it's not like this all the time.
goddamn it. i want louis.
said, a person's gotta make a living.
and thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; i generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. there are those who attempt both at the same time but i find it course and vulgar. now where were we?
get a life.
major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
mccool's that same rank.  we're both j.g.'s.
settle down beavis.  why don't you tell us the truth?
nikki.
but you're not?
obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
nothing. i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
i always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  we're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
yeah.  goodnight.
alright, cut, cut, cut.
hi, dad!
there <u>have</u> been northern sightings. but not <u>this</u> north.
i'm a deserter.
oh my god! he ripped out his -- he killed him!
let's grab some food.
and now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
thank you.
still clear?
little bill? he didn't say nothing. like i said, he was buildin' his porch. have you seen that thing?
i don't need to talk to you.
oh, that's nice--
i wouldn't know anything about that.
are you done?
so, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... i'm turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  they'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
dr. woodly?  you know who this is?
come on.  ease off the girl.
uh ... nah.
we can't leave him!
asian? no.
no, i don't believe i know anyone by that name.
try the car.
...yes i did...?
put your eyeballs back in your head, william randolph. i'm on assignment. a girl has to fit in.
i have a better suggestion. let's forget that the telephone ever rang. i never heard that you are yakushova... you are ninotchka... my ninotchka...
for me? trevor! how romantic! come here, you.
excuse me?
they won't hurt us, donny.  these men are cowards.
he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania. he disappeared from there last april. i've been hired to look for him.
well, clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
what now, sonny?
all i know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
i'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. i have to know who is in my house.
she don't wanna use my pots and pans!
just get back here!
pardon me?
give me the bad news.
who's gonna tell'em.
elizabeth!?!  'can't waits any longer.  arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' oh, god!  not tonight.
learned judges: my case is simple. it is based on our first article of faith: that the almighty created the ape in his own image; that he gave him a soul and a mind; that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would i be?
yeah.
the sooner we do this the better, mr. baker.
leave her out of this.
yeah, right.

make it twenty.
yes, i guess you are.
thank you.. .goodnight.
where he used to live. you can catch the riot squad -- it's just going out.
how can we stops him now?
i should be eating with the crew.
one word.  you won't find it in the phone book.
haven't you had enough of us, dad?
yeah, i'm really, really happy. really having a good time.
i'm in love with you.
it's a complicated subject.
yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to mexico to work in the sweatshops.
you hear me, girl?
please don't do this.
what?
that's government property, major.
...the solution presents itself.
it's not good for you, animal.
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
you are this museum.  it won't be the same without you.
twelve.
what programs were accessed?
you mean we're moving in?
where is it?  i don't see the --
i know what mommy says. i'm in charge today, though.
have you got the will?
what's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. it's a cut and dried case.
really?
i'm sorry, john.
keep me informed of what he's up to. you help me, i'll help you.
local?
so, how are you doing in marlboro country? is the magazine complaining at all?
well the answer is that i don't know either.  we haven't done it yet.
nah. we still got billy bob.
goddammit, i am sick of this --
welcome to work, ed.
you cannot say that!
don't try to speak... it's alright...
seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
something lecktor said.
... blind as a tiberian bat. what do you make of the plantoid beyond?
oh, come on, bill.  don't patronize me.   i'm not one of your little...  turn around.  i'm talking to you!... turnaround!
i think so.
i miss them, too.
hello there. are you two heading for las vegas?

your father is proud of you.
oh my god, so good. that girl can fuck.
yeah. he said that.
thanks.  so which one are you? sister bruce?  sister doug?
it'll be wonderful.  we'll be at peace.  in the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
look at me! my dress is ruined. i look like shit.
i got seared.
uh huh.
wait a minute.  there's an apartment in that area called the castle arms.
who could better understand than me?
a water main broke.
it's <u>garlic</u>!!  i like garlic, but...
which you don't have.
she was very badly raped, you see. we were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. i was left a helpless cripple. the doctors said it was pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. the doctors told me it was pneumonia, but i knew what it was. a victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. suddenly his mood changes. he wheels right up to alex.
but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
when i'm on my bike i feel like a wild person.  better than any sex i've ever had.
to a hard night's work, son. come on! 
that's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
to the bastille.  and death.
found?  where?
uh... hello?
ladies and gentlemen...
i was the more deceived.
oh no. thank you. come on in.
oh, yes sir.
but i am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
good night, daddy.
what?
then come with me.
oh romance is not a children's game...
now who's being sarcastic?
i moved the couch. that's all.
i didn't think so. i've fucked detectives. who are you?
today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
i don't know very much about her...i was hoping that you could help me.
...and i have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
i feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
i know that this was probably a great white shark.  car-cadon... caradan....
i borrowed it from this guy i know. so?
can you loan me a 20?
i never even visited nursery before tonight.  when you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
bene! bene!
i'd love to, but unfortunately i'm expecting some company.
sexogerarian, eh?  yes.  yes.  but i can't put that in the paper.
because it's fair.  give me next quarter.  if you still feel this way, vote your shares...
the last four.

-- leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard. he came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy. he tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. he started running for the open grass. with the car moving, jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed leo's spine. leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. and some chicken feed. stale chicken feed with four days mold.  electromagnetic printing.
i don't have anyone to talk to things about and i understand it's confidential with a doctor - i'm embarrassed about that and i don't want my sisters to know?
yes mam...
hi, melanie.
yes.

yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
who's fred?
yeah.
they have repressed the creator.
men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. i will not budge for no man's pleasure, i.
well if it isn't vada, the grasshopper girl.
'anything funny' like what?
you also have a power, conner.  it is why you have survived.
i dove back into work, everything was fine. until the lesions started...
yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
we're under investigation now.  back in seattle.  hap wanted to talk.  as soon as we got back.  thought he could work out some kind of deal.
when i go off?
quick, everyone to the lab.
come on, mom, you can't be serious....
right.
i don't think it's negative five.
and how long are you here for?
because everyone knows he's guilty...
let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call -  'hello, adolf? wilhelm speaking. listen, old pal, there's a jew-boy musician i want you to help. he needs a permit to get to paris.'
two minutes, 35 seconds.  damnit, i'm involved in this thing, so i just wanna know what this thing is. i wanna be treated as an adult.
closer to japan.  you're fast.
what?
what?!
okay... if you're the president, when's your wife's birthday?
ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
tip was fine, jake. we were a little more curious about the fed.
i almost didn't.
no. then they were led by his underlings. but i knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of the fortress. they use up much of their strength to do these things. they are taking great risks.
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
always, my dear one, never any further.  love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  a full diet can only kill it.
i don't know. i'm lost. i'm scared. i feel like i'm disappearing. i'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
they're all fine.  just bruises and shit.
madeleine, a hundred miles south of san francisco there's an old spanish mission, mission san juan bautista. it's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. now, think hard, darling. you've been there before. you've seen it!
i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?
what an odd question!
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
we played with a code using <u>the new</u> <u>york times</u> obituaries.  over three years we played twelve matches.  i never won.
xxxxxx
scotty!
hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
screw it. we been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, emily, or to let me use your phone? because we seem to have a slight problem...
god, i want to do everything!  i'm going to explode.
yes.
come over here.
you ever think about gettin' remarried?
i ought to fuckin' have you committed. you fuckin' do that again,  i'll f-, i'll f-
now husband and wife.
i think it's fizzled out.
look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
did you get it?
you know, i saw you once there, in london. you're a great attraction.
cuz, dummy they're canadian, just like ike!
...never reads the paper...
look -  this pose is all wrong!
why don't you ask them?
i know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
ain't no one seen him.
don't go blamin' yourself...
for dignity. my reputation is at stake. just put it on.
yes.  now about our date for tonight...
oh no. it is a sublime piece. the grandest operone. i tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
you're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
last night in this very restaurant mr. jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
you, an army brat? i don't see that one at all. did you join the service as well?
for the flat.
what about you? what are you doing? something strange, i bet.
mon captain, it's for you. 
many happy returns of the day...
yes, you could.  i think you need it more than i do.  it'll help.  i promise.
look!
where's the new drop point...?
well, you got it now.
do you know why you shot those puppies, john?  is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
my wife needs space, i don't know my kids ' birthdays.  everyone wants tiger woods, but they could get me, so i'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
come on where? back to a one-room apartment that i can't pay for? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
it was a mistake.
you son of a bitch! i'll have my lawyers shut you down.
nothin'.
what for... why?
what department store did they go to?
the only thing i know is he's an anti-semite.
clockworks.
you?
well, i got homework.
forget it.
i like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
what do i do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
i didn't know he had a wine cellar.
what?... maybe... no... i dunno...
why are you doing this to me?
for your eyes. for most patients of your age, i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens.
stop me.
i hear we must pay for everything. how much for this?
who is it?
it came from across the lake.
yeah, you know. probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or...
i'm retired.
i've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the eastern shore.
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him?
i --
duncan...  duncan, i promised you an answer. you have complimented me with your persistence and patience... but the decision i've come to is i'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
no?
roof? jesus, skinny, i done practically every damn thing myself. roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
yes.
have him committed.
just wanted to let you know you're sitting in my chair.
i don't know.

working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. you go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
shut your bleedin' hole!!!
what's he sayin'?
it affords him other interesting opportunities.
sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
gimme those dice. i'll blow this board to pieces. here we go...  lebenty leben, count me over eleven, martini...
it’s complicated, dad.
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  but i'm trying to be honest, okay?  three years is a long time.  don't ask me to predict how i'll feel then, jordan, because i don't know.  and either do you.
that's cool. well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
do you still love her?
night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  it's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
finally!  so you're our canadian pickpocket?
groovy!
hop away little bunny.  before i cool your jets.  permanently.
you're too late.  there was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  but he turned to dust and blew away.  i don't have any power for you to take.
dad i'm kidding, you can have the room.
of course.
better safe than sorry.
my god!  wha-what is this?  the gestapo?  no.
what are you talking about?
he suspects i know something. i think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case i do.  we have to go in tonight. i'm two hours from a beta version.  but i've gotta go home for an hour.
what?
he had a pressing engagement.

i know! he killed kincaid!
i am sorry, madame. it is not permitted.
no -- clothes.  stevie, they changed into them.
mmm, that's a good one.  maybe his echo...  okay, no more stalling.
i'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, mr. gardiner.
trying to write our report....
it's great and everything, but what am i going to do with all this?
okay, dennis.
she's younger than i am. did she tell you that? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
sure thing. please don't worry about me. can i help you with the dishes?
yeah seems okay.

that's it!  the unbreakable line! we'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, i'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
i'm sorry, was there a question in there?
i can't wait for you to meet her!
eggs he asks me for. oranges. what you need is a good horse-whipping.
he and his love are like a retiarius.  do you know what a retiarius is?
uh-oh.
right. cool. so, how about we take a bath together?
so you found mary?
i've got to work...
some people like it.
he's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
no, you're not.
so the scots will have none of them, will they? my armorers have already made a thousand.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
leaving?  for how long?
that hurt my feelings.
well. i can't stay.
no--
from that moment on, i foresaw what i might be.  already i felt the earth flee beneath me, as if i were being carried away up to the sky.
...both maybe?
don't need luck tonight.  i'm just letting 'em have their say before i say no.
what do you mean you can see?
this way, sir.
alright, go to the belt store...
what is this, some kind of joke?
do you have a moment, sir?
how's the birthday girl?
i'll talk the way i want to. i've had enough of this.
what's the matter... they never housebroke you?
no! you get it!
you don't owe me anything.
the tank will be finished by morning...
it's really slow. it's slow boring.
i have an idea.  but, i mean, i'm just making this up...
sure!  i'll even let you drive.
you certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  nice lookin'.
absolutely! i was there twice last year. which building is yours?
not too bad.
oh, yes. right. the rat and parrot.
do?  what can you do?  what did you expect?  he wasn't jewish. did you know bow they live?  your father would never stay out this late without calling.  in thirty years he never stayed out all night.
it's nothing to do with you. it's me they wanted, not you. why do you interfere in other people's business?
oh, sorry, right.
he's got my daddy's watch, claude. i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock. and that was you, mr. pike.
i'm glad you stayed.  thank you.
wait a minute.  "raban?"  where have i heard that name?
you klingons never do anything small, do you...
i've made arrangements with dr. gynde for 10:30. but jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; i need the car this morning.
oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
great...  ...wanda!
what is?
got it. thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
so that's the way it is?
you want to come here a minute?
alright, alright, enough with the boy scout routine.
don't move. we --
how's your war, mac?
it's my mother's piano.
why wait?
"i will follow you in all our vows and duties."
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  you realize what would happen if this fort fell?  the whole hudson would be open to them!
what?
my first squadron in vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. ten guys. the first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
those checks take forever.
i just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching tv.
and i believe what you say.  but this is tv.  no pictures, no story.
good.
that's all right. if i think of something, i'll send my butler over to tell you.
you've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. ellie and i got married because we love each other. and she's proving it; as far as i'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
i guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
i thought they came right past here ——
not at all.  margo, this is eve harrington.
how far's the river from here, mose?
why is it called hellgate?
he said it was important to have standards. he said nobody has pride anymore.
i won't.
do you want to talk about it?
nothing to tell.
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
our lord said just the opposite.
i suppose it is.
you're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  that's why you're so tense!  forget norbert. relax.  it's body time.
yeah! no more clicks and whistles! now she speaks perfect english!
well, offer her a seat! you want me to do it?
about what?
but i thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
what...
i have been... and always shall be... your friend. live long... and prosper!
hello, miss ukraine...
you were around the old timers who dreamed up how the families should be organized, how they based it on the old roman legions, and called them 'regimes'... with the 'capos' and 'soldiers,' and it worked.
thais.
and sarge?
i realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
who was the friend?
avionics compartment! it's the only place. you better get zedeck down there fast unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
sometimes i only think about kissing women.
-- it was a betrayal.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
how many families live here with you?
it's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless.  unblinking in his prejudice.
what peace conference?
it's up to you. air patagonia. new outfit: via caracas and bogot . no catering. four hundred and eleven pounds. four one one. good value, but refueling at bogot  is variable.
sure.
lots n lotsa cash.  stay on for gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
there isn't anyplace else --  except the worker bar.
all right, darling.
i, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
you sound bitter.
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
i bet mom could've helped her.
i love you...
who's in pyjamas, walter?
megan halesy' little sister.
i tried it once... fourteen years ago... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father. the only thing i'm good at is this... at least until yesterday.
then, you have my thanks, captain charles, for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
why?
i had to quit, midge.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
sunlight?
which is?
what are you talking about? we went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
it could be anything. you're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
i guess i do too.
well, i'm really am most awfully sorry but i ... i can explain everything ...
honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  but we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, sam? all that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know i was tightly wound--
you have to! quickly!
unbearable, i'd imagine.
hi, dolores.
sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if i hadn't tol' you.
that room!
i just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
i don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. i've been through this a hundred times.
hey, big fucking deal.  broke a bad streak...
well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  i'm sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
which way to the hollywood bowl?
lots of times....
it's not my fault.
okay, what happened?
sorry.
already? you poor thing. it won't last.
no prisoners. don't worry, frank, just a little psychological first aid.
you don't sew at all!
oh, he's all right.  we know all about him.  he does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
don't worry. thanks.
not me. it would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
why not?
go on.
...there's nobody.
let's see...  next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
i'm sorry, iris. i didn't mean that.
right from the start we didn't do it right. could you kneel down?
how'm i doing so far?
promise.  cross my heart.  but until mommy gets back, dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
i saw it. i saw it in your eyes.
me?  sing?
then let's spend some money.
what did they say?
my dad's name was frank patrick sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard mets fan.  and every night when i went to bed he sang to me...  take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
was there ever any kind of investigation...
you weren't going with her?
i thought you had to get to miami.
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
she didn't hand you to me.  she doesn't even know who you are. she told me about lisa henderson.
now you got me.
my what?!
no.
jason. he's what happened. then grendel hit space lab.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
...don't you like me?
baby listen, there's nothing more american than not doing anything and getting away with it.
we've got six hours left.
did you bring that tape?
since we was just grasshoppers...
i have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into mr miles' car. she wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  tomorrow then?
you're losing your temper!
yes please!
i'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
hell, jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
what you need is an engineer.  if you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
they were using m-1's, yeah--
what you want me to want, you mean. what you've decided i ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. but you've never given me anything that -
do like the soldier, toto! go away! this land is cursed.  when you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. then you go away, one year, two...and when you come back, everything's different. the thread has broken. you don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. isn't that the case?...you've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...but not now, it's impossible. now you're blinder than i am. 
i'm sorry.  that was impressive. the...  tumbling.
don't keep calling me that. it puts me at such a distance. i was not born a court composer, you know. i'm from a small town, just like your husband.
it's creasy.
yeah?
the way what is going to be?
look, everything's going your way.
not the 't' word.
you already asked me that.  why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
how could you forget? we talk about seeing other people and you forget?
dancing?
no.
they'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
hope you find him. i love that dog.
i expect.
no way. there's no way i'm giving that money back. it's my money now.
well, bravo!  what with you and whistler's ma - i think i've got a winning team.
well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
i never saw him before!
just following doctor's orders. i've decided to become a mensch. you know what that means? a human being.
or perchance...
my pleasure.
well...
really?  look in your ex-wife's eyes.
listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
you've got to help me to remain faithful.
yeah.
sorry, police orders. i'll stay out of the way, i promise.
no fucking way.
no.
have i? do you know when i come to think about it it's staggering. if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals. imagine! an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
are you asking me out?
but, you know, so what?
the little people?
what, and i care? remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
looks like he lied to you too.
nice.
when?
everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
you're a whore?
uh huh.
the date.
yes sir.
listen. do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they'd do.
is that so?
guys, guys! come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. i was the one who grabbed trip's jacket by mistake. it's my fault and i apologize.
are you all right?
the red dress?  no. my black one. then i'll be just like him.
she's coming. charley vidal gave her a lift.
all right. but just remember, my name is roger murdock.
why do they listen to guy?
so...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
hit the lights again.
'course i do -- i deliver money for him.
monsieur andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  and guess what else?
can i come? i'll start a fire...
how did you find out?
he's full of shit.
i'll need something personal of theirs.
goddamn you! that's trespassing!
ok. lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. it's going to be a long walk. 
can i tell you something?
mmm, i love cristal, let's have some.
oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, sooze, screwed up the tickets.
the past, the future, whatever this object holds.
i've lost you.  you're gone.  i can't hear anything.
no one else in there with you?
and they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
dude. seriously?
conrad, what a surprise.  gesundheit.
must you use that awful word?
didn't you see it? he lifted me up and crashed me down.
why? come on, leonard, we talked about this. it's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
i'm just trying to help you, sayer. i don't want you to be disappointed.  it gets cold out here at night.
exactly! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. that's it! if you don't do that, nothing else matters. the cars, the clothes, the houses...
horror flicks. b-movies from milton's heyday.
i hate the platonic idea of you.
but it's not a year from now, is it?
you bet.
uh huh.
i am you, you little bastard.
you're not safe on your own.
i'm shootin' pool, fats. when i miss you can shoot.
hmm-mmm.
i'm just getting started....
dad's way? where did he tell you that? in a fucking seance?
we know these people...!
sad? what made you sad?
give me a goddam break. i'm not going to go anywhere alone.
debbie.  she's gone.  i've...collected her, like the others.
she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the doctors.
why? the guys is ready to deal now.
don't call me that --
listen, i'm coming over. don't go anywhere. stay right there.
that's sick, dante.
i just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
what if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? you could sit and read the national geographic.
it's closed... closed. we need one that's open.
janie?
give me two more.
shhhh.
in their eyes, the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
stay calm, identify the problem. problem, rope fraying.  solution, fix rope.
i'm game.  sure.
because he knows how to get to our man.
i just want everything to be perfect between us.
goddamit...
he wants to know do i mean that.
i see. was that all she said?
yeah. i mean, you are my brother and... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. so, i've decided to make it up to you.
could be a stroke. who knows?  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "like wild dogs."
i've been on a plane for twelve hours, i think i'll stand.
--i'm woodward.
--colson.
this is my home.  i'm part of the wallpaper.
who was this partner of his?
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today. don't you agree?
it would make a marvelous attraction;  the only great white in captivity.
so was mary magdalene, and our lord loved her.
monday.
just a thought --
soon.
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
you sober?
i didn't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here.  you don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  i studied it in high school.
if we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
mcmurphy, doc. r.p. mcmurphy.
so you're in?
she did?
like your step-brother sebastian. i can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
i can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
i don't know the details of the treaty, sire, marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau.
johnny friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
what can i do for you?
so, what do you say, let?
we just got a bomb threat upstairs.
yes.
my mouth is kinda dry.
... brom bones...
did you send this? is it a joke?
we all have to be strong, right?
funny, jack.  i’m laughing on the inside.
how do you know what i experience?
when i was a kid? and he was moving us all over the place? i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 1.0. i thought gary boyd was the greatest.
i'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
i'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  you're still in command.  clayton forrester!  i haven't seen you since oak ridge.
well that's a no.  no wonder you're not psyched about sex.  you've never even had one manually?
i'd like to believe that i'm not... but i've just never seen any proof. so i just choose not to bother with it. it's, like, i could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. weighing the pros and cons. and in the end, i still wouldn't have any proof. so... i don't even debate it any more. because it's absurd.  i don't want to be alone.  so, does that make me, like, an atheist?
it's not a long drive. an hour, an hour and a half. we'll be back in time for dinner.
"i can always find someplace else to work. someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the french riviera ..."
did i tell ya it's great to see ya again?
you're firin' me?
i can show you how to get out of prison. and it's no hype.
well... i've got a little more news about your friend healy.
that's all i want... it's the only thing i have ever wanted.
you got a minute?
you talk as if—
what i want to do!  right now. what is really inside of me.
"dracula."
we're being paid to see where they go...how they propagate....
how are you, raymond?
what about her teeth? what about her fangs?
look, maybe you oughta' leave.
a journal. just have him write down everything he does.
i'll hit you, frank.  i swear.
i'll tell you what it is, mr. dugan. i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways.  i ain't used to 'em, sir.
would you do us the honor of joining us? we're just sitting down at mess.  pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
june 3rd, god willing, i'll marry your dad.  and then i <u>will</u> be your stepmom. and right now, i'm not looking forward to th...
dizzy wouldn't want our tears. she'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. so go out and kill a bug for dizzy. kill as many as you can. you are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
nonsense!
how?
can you handle the door gun?
about what?
i feel so ineffectual. is there anything i can do for you?
the l.a. river?
how come you wanted to meet tonight?
main street.
moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, i have the mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: i may own the studio when i get through with you: i got a civil suit, i got rape, i got collusion...
c'mon. let's go.
i will miss you.
nothing, thank heaven.
good.  i want you to have a good time.
thanks, mac.  and thanks for being so supportive about all this.  i really love you, you know.
well, it all depends, leonard...
huh?
we take off our hat and coat.  we sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. we look at each other. we smile.  well... we don't smile. how about some music?
that doesn't matter -- you don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
no, buddy, i'm the one he wants.
aren't you allowed to kiss back?
i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission.
i want to do this for you.  i want to do something good for a change.
oh god, i'm so glad, robert, that you're coming...
he didn't.
no.
cool, can i get one for vada?
where?
that's the way of it, fettes.  you bring the lassie to me.
stay with me, gib.  we're gonna do this.
i could be mentoring kramer. kramer clerked for scalia.
i was twelve.
wait, jimmy.  think about it.  you woulda done the same thing if you was me.
right! she called me an old lady here, too! and i remember, i said...
maybe it was more than that.
i don't know. i don't know what happened mother, i woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but i don't know what happened.  i don't know what i did wrong, i don't know and i should be punished.
they broke when you fell.
i'll be at the wheel myself.
because he is trying to retire me.
married boyd aviation. he's no dummy, that's serious coin.
how's this going to work?
they live here, used to be like us. but after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. the only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  snake, nobody who comes into beverly hills gets out alive.
tch.
he doesn't look like he's going anywhere, bill. and if necessary, i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
once i got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. i didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... you were in too many discos during the seventies.  the village people rotted your brain.
this isn't a request.
i don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
it's not fair!!
you don't but it, do you?  she knew nobody would but it.  she knew i'd say she did it.  and she knew nobody would buy it.
the "stiff?"  he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
i don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin irish. you heard of the westies?.
the old ones were much spookier. they had castles, full moons...
joe's escaped. dieter's in him.
what's that supposed to mean?
nowhere. i'm trying to find her.
everyone has to follow his own plough. a man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. city people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. you don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  it's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. you sell it to a stranger. you worked your whole life, for what?  i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. all what we've experienced has no meaning.
stop that, fran.
well, i've flown seven million miles. and i've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. i make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. and now with this arrest hanging over my head, i'm scared. if i lose my job i gotta start all over again, but i got nothin' to start over with. i'll be stuck with whatever i can get. and that scares me more than ordell.
nobody touches her. except me. i touch her. sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
some people might.
now, sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
i was doing my job.
that's more like it.  two more nitrate-sicles please.
you mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? about how much?
hello, is this elaine?
good argument for gun-control.  what are you going after, rhino?
a three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. for what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player?
i can hear you good. can you hear me?
the add just said &quot;makeup artist&quot;

top left, like you asked.  today wall street.  tomorrow, who knows...maybe washington.
is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the bureau, the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
so if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
i wasn't finished.
hope so. he's working for us.
take note mr. mason...this is why you hire a professional...no whining. no excuses.
on account of me.
well done, mr. scott. how soon can we be ready for warp speed?
she probably got a date by now, angie.
i'm going to kentucky. to louisville. with a friend. try to make some money. i need it, the money. i'll be leaving early in the morning.
really?!
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
-is it, i'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
i'm an old friend... i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in --
kurtzweil, we think.
any day.
i thought so.
anything...specific?
what is it with this guy?
no.
you ain't got to do nothing. just point at it and push the button. you'll hear the car go "bleep." that means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even uncle sam. they all want their share.
i want to go to an east coast school! i want you to trust me to make my own choices.  i want --
i was asked by my father to open neg-
answers.
of course not.
he knows me?
thomas. he told me it was a very nice place.
yah?
no, do you really?
call me david.
for vienna?
oh god!
i need your help.  in order to fight blackheart, i must wear the armor of achilles.  i --
i think so, beth.  yes.
that's fucked it. what do we do now? no money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
why would you ask now?  you never asked before!
hey, tattoo!
yes, i'm from cleveland.
so you're just going to be vindictive
you were one of those guys that played dungeons & dragons with real swords, weren't you.
god, no.  i thought about it for practically the entire flight...
what do you want me to start with -- the golden gate bridge?
mm hm... two ball, side pocket.
when will you wake up?  you wouldn't know a normal life if it bit you in the ass.
carl, that's insane.
story of my life.
and what was that neighbor guy doing here?
go back and tell dr. neilsen. have him report to the skipper.
so long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  don't you understand?  they want proof that god is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
you still mad at'm?
yes.  dead.  two nights ago.  the night of my dream.
nick, no --
hi.
don't get any ideas. of course it comes out of your share.
he'll not flee if i show myself?
business.
i don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. it's ending at your doorstep.
hell, yeah. to her dumb country ass, compton is hollywood. close as she's ever been, anyway.
listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
edith, i'd like you to meet my son, harold. harold, this is edith... eh?
just don't worry about it.  how we doin' timewise?
i knew this guy was too perfect. he was destined to have a flaw.
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
bet.
about six years. my partner took me.
love.
you're not getting any navy contracts.
i don't know.  maybe there's two of them.  maybe he hired some wino to make the calls.
you were never apart, you and clive. he kept asking and asking.  and i waited and waited for you to say something. and you never did.
what about citrine?
what do you want from me, colette?
oh. what... yeah. okay.
i'll go. i don't mind. really.
he was major andrew bryn-...
she knows now.
that's following a train of thought.
now.
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car.
i think so.
what about sports?
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
four hundred bucks.
i've had two meetings with him. he's a great musician. maybe the greatest conductor in the world. his brahms, beethoven, schubert - unequalled.
hell, that rings a bell. someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the nothin' fancy yesterday.
if i die, then they'll be free. it's getting late, isn't it? i can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. it's warm then it gets cold. jeffrey. i feel it getting cold.
antarctica??
i hope everything is settled.
it's not your fault, it's her fault!
i'll handle it. i'll handle it. hi.
what do you want?
the lesson being?
what happened to her?
why don't we start with that next week?
they're liars and cowards.
it's a surprise.
i'm all ears.
you shut up now, boy.
they think it's school-related?
give me a break, would you?
are we done now? you've got nothing on me. so if you ain't booking me, i'm walking.
i'll be up soon, little chief.
oh -- not too much. taking it easy.
wrong week. next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon.
two hundred cops?  was mario sanchez there?  he owes me money.
eighteen yards.  that's my house there.
good evening, wilson.
roughly, one-zero-five. i'll have it plotted in a minute, major kong.
we'll see.
ah, your journal. this will be invaluable.
but how?
why they glow like that?
i am uncertain. i have had little experience with emotions. i am unable to articulate the sensation.
my tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
why?
sir? 
but he had a spare d-6, you said. right there.  why not use that?
what, it's not weird.  i just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
we're doing this for ma.
no shit -- hot damn --
all right, amy.  go tell edward to take you.
dad, i don't know how to tell you this. and i was going to wait a while, but i think...dad,there was no bomb. a plane crashed into our backyard. i looked it up in old newspapers.
where are they holding the wake? i'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
thanks for the movie, randy.
no way --
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
my mother's dead. my daddy's s'posed to be around still. he don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
must've...anyway, i ain't goin' back to look for it...
i ain't scared of you.
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
you know tony doesn't have that kind of money.
yeah, you're probably right.
i had to...in the games...
what about?
right home after. see you.
i don't expect to live that long.
i'm a simultaneous translator -- like sylvie, only she's english to french -- i'm french to english. that's what i did before i married charles. the police probably think i killed him.
stanzi-manzi, i'll put it in your hand!
just a minute.
i should look different.
...are you alright, sir...?
we made it. commander, we made it.' m alexander sort ov) by grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
anna?  with this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause i'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
first you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
so read it! you just hung a target around her neck!
it’s like a museum.
...we put your guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
no, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  okay, let's get a move on!  when are you leaving?
the amulet...
can i help you with something?
what plate?
i'm not supposed to.
can't live without trouble, can you?  nice place you got here. real nice.
pow.
do you suppose it has anything to do with lila's unusually hairy body?
serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
-- there's no time --
she's on the north head bluff - approaching the cliffs.  one klick away.
but...
oh... er... yes...
listen to me. i am dr. smith's brother -- reverend smith -- and i am supposed to perform the ceremony. i just got in -- from -- portland -- and i've forgotten what church -- you see?
yes, sir...
koros, as in...koros?  dimitri koros?
i'm your soldier.
pierdo.
show's over.
how do you mean?
the heelots!
could you please put my glass on the table?
i like--really need a cigarette, too.
. he will remain always as he is.
just a friend.
ever heard of knocking, mayo?
absolutely. we would be honored.
across both tracks!!
more questions. always the explorer. if you stay long enough, that'll change.
i know exactly what i'm doing.  get out!
uh.
-- water! --
it's nothing. c'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
yes, she takes care of the garden.
here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
okay.  frankie, you're a good boy.
guess maybe i'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
i'm clementine. can i borrow a piece of your chicken?
well, kind of recently, i guess. but not too recently.
you don't live around here, do you?
and just how do you figure that, bert? what do you figure i owe you?
claire--
yeah?
she's home -- stuffing a turkey.
nobody's that unhappy.
what is that that smells so wonderful.
yes.
we were talking one time, drinking rum.  i may've mentioned adele, how she worked for a magician.  chino got interested.  he's like, yeah?  how does he saw the woman in half?  he wanted to meet her.  or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
what is it?
fuckin' mau mau land, that's what it is.
oh really. then why is he called jake. why don't you come clean and call him jack.  there's no hope in it.
pain can be controlled. you disconnect it.
more than that. i believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
you didn't take it.
friday...god, i hate the thought of him home all day.
man, why do you keep asking me that?
diane takes care of the books. i don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
no sir, not at all. it's just that i'm going to open my own business and...
but what about school records? homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
i thought you got rid of...
oh? did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
oh, sure, i unnerstand, i didn't mean to -
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road?
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
he's not finished.
right next to the one you already had.
oh-oh.
oh huh
go back to where you came from.  or die here.
what do you want me to do for you, mr. stephens?
you driving her?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
i know.  i like your little outfit.
is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to drake bishop... owner of the stratosphere hotel & casino?
uh, why, why are you doing this?
before you do, ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
it'll never stick.
sustained.
only common sense.
calm down, bud.
what'd they ever do for you?
his name is maurice.  he's dancing around everything else.
he ain't really new.
yeah?
-- i'm going to try, mr. webster.
i'm not kidding. joan gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and i saw the most horrible thing down there.
it'd have to be pretty good.
why? what for?
what class sub does your nephew run?
i'll scream.
nine ball.  three ball.
it's not what i heard.
boogerland!
more people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
i don't know.
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
okay.
uh... nightmare on elm street.
in a corridor.
where are you going, sebastian?
table 122?
oh, you're wrong. he told me --
i hit her.
word.
aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all i got!
i did--and--and i got right up.
well, hello there, honey-pie.
more so than the shark?
you know, i don't love anybody.
is this a--what day is this?
well, we're...
can we go now?
hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  me and mitchell, bob and lemalle, we were teams.  i'd always go with mitchell.  good man, mitchell.  i'd let bob worry about goddamn lemalle.  we'd hire a plane in october.  on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  we'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas.
oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. anyway, hillary said that you had a black ford truck and this policeman i know got in touch with motor vehicles and...he gave me your address and here i am.
the caddy?  why don’t you take your own damn car!
it's just one of my students, grant.
but i'm concerned with everything, mr. bebe.
it's just that i've been out of the game so long. trent, i was with her for six years. that's before aids. i'm scared. i don't know how to talk to them, i don't know...
no. okay. i'll think about it.
good to meet you, dr. wigand.
switch hands.
i thought you were quite good in it. i also like the girl in it. really thought she was good.  i wondered if she was still around. if she was still working.
i am not afraid.  read it!
yes'm.
yes?
sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them. just sometimes.
but there's the doll, sir.
i agree.
if they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. we can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
sure. i love venice.
where are you going?
now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
some.
who's next? you? me? bob?
daitz hinted it existed. it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
she may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
it will never make house beautiful. i guess it's o.k. for one night.
so you think it's all nonsense, huh?
poor freud, turning in his grave.
why?
open it.
i think you're the greatest. but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
well, happen, in the sense that i picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k.
yes...yes, you have yours.
you should come. i'll buy you a drink.
well, he can just fuck himself.
i haven't any.
because i don't feel safe until i get the lights on.
coupons.
no!! we're going all the way!  you got that, dyson?
what do you want me to say?
i'm doing the best i can!
he could be brought back.
what are they going to do?
i see.
i'm too busy, actually. not for the army, of course, but where i live. dr. yamachi's new era pediatric hospital and whorehouse. i'm serious. the guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
no again?
no.....but i think honza at the office has. you keep shifting this crap and i'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. take a break for lunch and i'll catch you up later.
i'm back from the dead.
yes.
wash them again.
what happened to your hand?
he wouldn't say. you gonna follow her?
you've checked that end?
no.  she's a school teacher.
you don't want to be sheriff.
the manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
you've got it all figured.
what variables?
yes.
oh, it's unfashionable, i know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by god, we get the job done.
what about the cellular phone bill?
why?
let us not discuss this further. i am very pleased....
you're a lucky man, all right.
i think he owes more to you.  but that's not important now.  i know what's going on between you two.
the greatest.  they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors.  hey, easy on the punch bowl.  budget only calls for three drinks per extra. fake the rest.
-- i have a feeling you're going to tell me.
yeah.  i can tell.  victor was right.
bob. you're trying my patience. andrew beckett is making his private life our business. we gave him kronos. did he say, "i'm sick. i might not be able to see this through?"
is he keyser soze i don't know, verbal. it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield. like you said, a spook story, but i know keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. stay here and let us protect you.
'thank you.'  how many mistake did i make?
i'll go.
no. they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices. the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. which is where the bodies were found. but that's the thing...
you should.
a mistake... it was a mistake...
it matters.  we do the best we can, that's all we have.
yeah i want something.  i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
you think you are... .
yeah, right outside the door!
sure looks that way.
that's what gordon's always saying.
i think we've all seen "bonanza".
fine.
i'm giving you three leads.  you...
hmmm.  but, consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
why is everything about you, jeff?
he got a little jealous.
fully.  i like her.  she has wit.
where. up joey's ocarina. didn't you know?
if i'm real, they'll get me out. if i'm not, they'll treat you. either way you'll be better off than you are now. you'll get a reward.
i'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i've never even heard of these people.
yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, i'm not in. hugo you're not in.
yeah?  so?
what makes you think we want to be cured? blood is only part of the equation. the hunt, the killing, that's what the thirst is really about.
i thought i would need it.

hell, i didn't know you was married.
you're not death.  you're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
calloway - i'm english, not irish.
and is that what you're going to do?  is that what you're going to do...?
you know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. that's the thing, romeo.
no, ma'am.
ladies and gentlemen: the "straub country-residence".
i'm hip.
i love you too. good night, darling-
the creatures?  they attacked you?  they tried to possess you?
it doesn't make sense to me.
no.
hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. have you got a licence for it?
what was that? i'm sorry, i didn't catch it. would you repeat it?
i'm serious! what happens if he blows up the school?
don't worry about it. he's not gettin' any and neither are you.
that's another thing i can't do.
we need all our fuel anyway.
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so, sister.
or did you steal it from your old friend renard?
i don't understand.
why didn't you say anything?
good. so did i.
that was the order, mr. sulu: clear the bridge.
lions and tigers and bears!
i don't understand.
yeah, well, that's enough.
i'm sorry.
no, nothing.
i thought you said no more aches and pains?
please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  but because i'm a female, i get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  i'm a ballplayer, okay.  a ball player.
it's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, distorting space-time. they could be what hit the lewis and clark.
wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
deep shit?
no, i am.  i am.
hi.
what's it called?
but you do. what does that say about you, ray? what does that say about me? i've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. but he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess i'm gonna have to school you myself.
oh--what's the point, bud?
you never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
in any state.
huh?
i want debbie.
yeah ... where is this? bosnia?
what if it never happens?  what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- this place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t keaton. it wasn't like that. sure he knew, but edie had him all turned around.                 r i'm telling you straight, i swear.                        +
ten throws it is.
nothing's wrong.  i just want to get something straight.  you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
what for paul.
bye.
why?
ch...
quite a good one. a monet. not major, but it is giverney.
the bar code on your neck, max.  i know who you are and i know who you're running from.
but it was your idea: "use zero," you said, use zero to get low.
you've been up all night?
holy water.
nothing like--uh--susan--or anything like that, huh?
i don't know him.  mr...
i'll schedule the launch.  call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
i did not--
opera? opera!
it's just as i thought.
under the underground?  what's that? where is ...
no, estellita.
yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and kevin haven't even done it yet.
what. what's the matter?
okay, colonel.  but look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  maybe that works, huh?  maybe it'll work?  what do you think?
i tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
it's silly, really.  i mean, i'd seen him at the office, obviously i'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and i got his lettuce and tomato on white.
that's because there's a lot of bad people out there. hey, puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
no.
fine. you got five...
aren't you?
that's risky gear. it can drive you schizo.
yes!  yes, i want her so badly i can taste it.  that's the whole point. look at us.  orphans.  isolated. obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  we're perfect targets. she's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
and how do you go about getting an exorcism?
how could i be?  the mainland has been found.  exactly as i said it would.
i'll have some coffee, please.
and that's why you're leaving?
bourne?
well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
what shall we do now?
is that all?
i'm fine, thomas. the garden is a healthy one. there is no need for a claim.
i know.  i know that.  don't spoil it.
who?
she can't really love that idiot, can she?
look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. you can help me make beds if you like.  come on.
he said i was right. i shouldn't wait for him. i was better to make a clean break.
well, i don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
that's out of the question. no one is going to genesis!
i don't understand..  reveal yourself to me!
yes, it is.
well, you got to get hold of yourself.  you got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
my dreams died long ago.
the what?
i said i never heard of him.
oh, the complete works of jacqueline susan, the novels of harold robbins....
this isn't what we agreed on. you guys have to take care of... this! you are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
what do you expect when you talk like that?
where's the dough?
no, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
that's what we're here to find out.
reed's always right. good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
not even daddy...or mommy?
 my two friends have my share of the money.  i'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
you be quiet, frank, we're talkin'. the adults are talkin'. were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
how will they come at you?
hey.
in the end, the jury saw it my way.
he probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
i wouldn't do that. it's against the law.
what the fuck i tell you. you don't hafta shoot nobody. just hold the gun. they'll get the idea.
you mean smashed!  she called up at midnight last week.  talking a bunch of crap.  pat can't stand her.
mmmmmmmph.
thank you, daphne.
twenty five minutes. they should be here any moment.
oh, naw. hi.
eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
i don't understand. who's responsible for all this? who is khan?
why?
how do you mean?
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party, theo.
because i was driving behind the bus, mary.  because i saw it.  i saw it happen...
strudel, this is herr mozart. say good morning.
how much sleep?
what is this?
which one is for the car?
don't try to change to the subject.
seventy-five percent.
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
say, all this john doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
new orbit commencing... coming up on sector three...
all right!  very good!  there's a barbarian in there after all!
i hate your kids, frank.
it's not that. it just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. in the trunk.
anything.  it's important.
you wrote bill's scripts!  jesus christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
fine...except when mom was airing gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into grampa's study and pooped in grampa's favorite chair.
you're so spoiled. what is "not good" to you? only a few hundred --
i'm sorry.
oh, right.  at my old place, we used to... wash cars.  groom dogs.  so... nice loom.
wasn't hocker lynched?
now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, ma.  we just don't pretend we know.
you seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
mrs. brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  i believe the stress is affecting you.  escort her to quarters and have monk prepare a tranquilizer.
commander... we have a problem.
skeleton key. this opens the gates of babylon.
i'm gonna call you back.
what about nonook?  what have you done to nanook?!  what have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
what? no. i'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
you've got the wrong idea about me. i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger.  can you help me find him?  i'll pay you anything.
what do you do?
i think so.
your client is guilty. don't dick around with me.
i'm going to try and locate redbeard- i assume you've heard of him.
not as yet, sir.
because...  i was already dead.
taylor, you surprise me.
what is?
yo, benny.
hi.
i got scared.
all right, brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - i'd want to.  hello, georgie.
confusin' me with johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. i only deal in life and death. all that stuff in between? some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
y'know what?
well... thank you.
then you're safer in here.
good god, you're really-
this is a mistake. no. this is a disaster.
sounds grim.
michael, you're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family.
you're getting obvious.
i don’t know. he seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
officer, i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody?
well stay for tonight, then.
moreover...
yeah?  well, fuck you.  sorry doesn't feed my kids.
five minutes, suzette, come back in five minutes. i'll ring.
no, i need'm now!
walking where?
really? do tell.
shh. don't blame yourself trevor. please.
and if it should change?
a comedy. all but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
well, uh, trini and i have an early plane.  we were hoping to get back to new york in time for ...
why not?
a new pair of panty hose. is it enough?
what're you doing in los angeles?
integrity - acute, like indigestion.
perfectly all right.  but if you'd like to sit --
mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
well, i hope you like these! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. or "nori" if you prefer. i love sushi.
i never make plans that far ahead.
i'm not cranky.  and that futon was not too big to carry myself-
you're talking too much about black africa, henry.  it's killing us with the rednecks.
i'll take my chances.
you like shrimp?  i like shrimp.
okay. then you can be of use.
maybe we should take it easy tonight.
i'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. and when i've drunk the last drop, if i still feel then, the way i feel now, i'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
to the black pearl.
will senator smith yield to--?
how can i be together if i'm not together?
you saw that?
ordell robbie. o-r-d-e-l-l. r-o-b-b- i-e. 1436 florence boulevard. compton 90222.
well, that's blunt!
they may have found her.  mrs. cortez -— this morning i told her jacqueline was no longer under my care.
how, did you know about my grandfather?
we're not really interested, henry.
jesus christ.  that's a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
oh, jesus.
you said you had no whiskey.
can you walk?
yeah.  another little matter needs attending to soon as i return.
well, have you asked her to come back?
