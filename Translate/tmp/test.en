you and your government!  what's the matter with you?  don't you have any feelings?  your daughter!  what kind of man are you?
with the compliments of colet and company!
i couldn't help it, wyatt.  i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face.  i mean these people're afraid to even walk down the street and i'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture.  that's not me, that's somebody i don't even know.

-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. i cannot commit treason, if i have never been his subject!
ya caught me in a bad mood.
you want me to be the bastard.
yeah, right.  don't push your luck. anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
so, i see you're really into spooks.
next to "boring," "sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current english language. i thought if i could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, i don't know...it would be vaguely revolutionary. it's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
and make sure he doesn't leave.
good night, jacqueline -- good night, mary.
an' she's got a beau! kisses him, too!
no last names, jonah.  hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  how come you're up so late?
oh, no, actually. busy night.
you mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
and i'm here tonight and i won't let him get to you.
i say again: grissom, this is enterprise. admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik. come in!
i'm here.
working hard on that book i was telling you about.  coming to the meeting?
yes. why?
wow.  you two really have something going, don't you?
hey look!
okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. my patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff. i owe him.
pull over and listen to me, will you? just listen..
i was surprised to get your note. my daughter hadn't told me anything about you. about your helping her.
...sir...?
so do i.  so do you.
pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? so what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. and when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. and, we give you medicine, and you get better. huh? okay? you're better already, aren't you?
you don't need to sit next to me right now.
you're fuckin' a right, no p.c. well screw p.c. no right. no goddamn right. you do some time, they never let you go. treat me like a criminal, i'll end up a criminal.
we'll never know for sure.
why can't it be her?
i know.
i'll be a monkey's kid sister! what d'you want to do a thing like that for?
uh-huh...
cole, what the hell are you doing?
i was gonna split it with you guys.
are you under the impression that now i'm in some way obligated to you?
you'll see.
just like to make sure.  that your past.  and my future.  are real different.
you gonna do it? you gonna do it?
randy, c'mon!
no.
bismark...
yeah, vibrations in the ground.
i also remember you drove your car here. who are you really? make no mistake, i will shoot you and not feel bad about it. who are you working for?
nice place.
i want to buy you a drink.
my son, why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer? is that your penance? is it?
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that's where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just isn't right with him. y'know?
of what?
even though i left, you never left me. not just memory but a substance in my blood.
margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in...
christ, you should have seen it. unbelievable.  the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin. that kid was scared.  not half as much as we were though.
but you're going skiing with us yankees, aren't you?
good. i'm sure we'll be friends.
try harder.
judy.
well here's the purse.
that sounds nice.
no. no. don't you say that.
i waited for you.
no whistles, but a club you bring a hack -- ?
sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what i mean? 'cause i-i have - i have my-my license here. you know, it's a rented car. and i've...
what're you doin'?
i'd say it was down.
no, i didn't.  i said, "will it change my life," alvy.
i don't believe that. i won't.
shouldn't we pick him up?
here it is, right here.
i'm talking about dna samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, fbi scientists. they figure this shit out. they always figure it out.
professor?
look at me.
you don't have to explain.
hi.
french.
charlie's downstairs. why aren't you ready?
i could never be a mother.
louis, my man. watcha doin'?
longer we hang around down here, jack, better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
you're not from l.a., huh?
hey, what's the rush?  c'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
he acquired some sort of power.  a power to manifest things.
yeah, most likely.
okay. mix.
no i'm not.
this is it!  we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game.
is this your shovel?
sure, king.
how do you hold down a job?  it's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she's missed her sunrise groom'n ride.
you wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
i think i'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
so is buddy on your short list?
no, i don't have the right.  you're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
victor, explain yourself.
and how do we do that?
you be careful, tommy. don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
we goin' huntin' again, daddy !?
a lot of people like our singing.
for a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
do you think j.j. likes steve...?
nothing. i dunno--
don't you believe it.
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition, doctor.
oh god.
hey.
let's get back to this one. have you really seen every performance?  why? i'm curious...
i know i shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and i couldn't resist and -- and -- i suck.
the hell you don't.
no, that was leavenworth. this --  was sioux falls. what ya want?
he saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you. i seen you over there follerin' me.
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. a small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  that was three hundred and nine years ago.
i was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. and then throw him in the can.
elizabeth, really! he's quite mad!
please... be cool.
i'll see you soon.
you like me better like this.
i'm wounded.  oh, oh.
then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
you think i'm staying?
now that we've broken the ice...
a thousand dollars ... and it's on all night?
but then, sir, why have you issued the order: wing attack, plan-r?
walter! d-did you see --  -- that?
only very rarely. you see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
shall i show you the nursery?  it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
you use words like that, you might make me mad.
all i'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
well, that's what i was saying. my father is getting old. and we're very close. he's a wonderful man, really...
i just realized this is for television, isn't it?  i can't swear up and down like i just did.
and congratulations on the birth of your son.
it was you.  downtown.
how much?
it's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
we're split down the middle. if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
can i help you?
i have a proposal, mr. kay.  this mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
tell me about them, thea. they have great wings end long teeth --
what'd you see?
i told you, i don't know where sidney is. and even if there was a third killer, sidney doesn't know about it.
you do good work, alice.
i thought we discussed patience, commander.
you don't wanna move, do you?
i don't have it yet. it's not finished. i'm sorry, but i need more time.
that fucking bastard! that fucking sick fucking bastard!
that is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, ma.
what...?
okay this is okay. smooth.  can i ask you something? do you think i tell too many stories in class?
you're a piece of shit
i do have a tendency to use that word too much.
chet!
call me jake. careful driving home, curly.
captain b-l. willard, sir -- 4th recon group -- i carry priority papers from com-sec intelligence 11 corp -- i believe you understand the nature of my mission.
you have to go.  he'll never stop. leave this place.  find another.
so did you do it?
when he finds out.
was she that bad?
i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
if this little show is for my benefit, i’ll take you home right now.
so tell me, do you like ron? is it serious?
i figure my only hope is that the big lebowski kills me before the germans can cut my dick off.
he's the only cat left that still grooves me.
you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.  six is me.
oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
he's not too bad.  i can live with him.
the word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  he is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
it's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
it's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too!
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
sounds like another one of your stories to me.
spotted you, chief.  pri one is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the a-team shows.  over.
nervous?
i found something in my sleep. the friar who married them will take up their destinies.
not for sure, monsieur, but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick.
he coded. they shocked him one too many times. i'm sorry.
and what? vultures? hawks? eagles?
now.
what was that all about? i thought everything must go!
what'd you say to him?
uh-huh. want one?
there'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
so what are we supposed to do?
fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
isn't it true that without esparza, you had no investigation?
danny, i don't like this fuckin' guy.
excuse me, i hope this isn't rude, but aren't you marion davies?
the what?
he does?
you don't have to—why, we're with you, mr. doe. we just lost our heads and acted like a mob. why, we . . .
two-headed monsters?
so what happened?
you'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
hildy!
i don't believe that.  he's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  you know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of germany.
i seem to have touched a nerve. don't be so sensitive, pops, let's keep this friendly. but you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  now, there's two ways we can play this hand. one way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. the other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, i'll win. but we go down the second, we'll both win. now, i don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. y'all can live forever or die this second and i don't care which. the only things i do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. and right now i need to get those three things into mexico. now, stop me if i'm wrong, but i take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. am i correct?
nothing really worthwhile.
your publisher says i'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
jeffrey?. why?
all those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
yup.
well it's more than loneliness. hate. people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? i'm all screwed up.
then who --
well, i wouldn't want to be --
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
and what do we get out of it?
i left it at work.
fuchs...?  no, it's not fuchs... you must let me back in... i won't harm anyone... i promise...
and we're going to have to do something about your hair.
jim, itís over.
frank pierce.
so. are you ready? i start columbia next fall. of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. i'm really excited.  and: rene gave me a job as his secretary. his poems are getting published.
johnny –
yeah, that's what i think.
we're going to leave that up to detective williams. i'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
you saw west's body.
i think i can help you, as it happens.
i need your insight, your intuition.
wally...?
boyfriend?
that's quite a compliment.
no! no!
what?
okay mr inventor, how do we avoid it ?
viceroy of the west indies.
yes?
gotta be another way up, frank.
you know what those leads cost?
i know that.
what?
attaboy!  come on, bruce.
i been in the penitentiary for four years. 
here's a press kit.  i'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne i'll be able to schedule the interviews.
you try. you try talking to her.
i ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
due to mr. gill's untimely demise and everything, i guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
your majesty, i'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
too late. i've tried. i think you're right, jake. i'm game.
i bring you the greetings of my president and the good will of my people.
yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
shall we go?
you know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned. a beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
want a hit?
want to read any books?  take your pick!  isn't this the craziest?
bobby -- i think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of mr. carpenter
david.
now, is your shit together?
harry...
you know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
i'll ask you again, dr. venkman.  why were you digging the hole?  and please remember that you're under oath.
is what a girl?
what did you tell them?
cut the crap.  you got a sheet the length of my arm...
don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.
i didn't know where she was going to lead you.
i gotta go.  we're on borrowed time.
do you have a suit?  let's get him one.... and a cell phone too.  and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on fifth avenue, would you?
sir?
better let me talk to him.
i said i didn't care.
is that what you'd like me to do?
do you like pigeons?
surviving is what i know --
but don't you like anything about what you do? 
hi, i'm out drinking champagne and roses... and i'm really happy. leave a message. beep.
ah, the dorothy chandler.  i was just there with my good friend art mooney the other night...
my mother...?  i never knew my real mother - i was adopted
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
if i activate them now, captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
what's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill.
objection!
i've always respected your opinion, martin.  if something worries you, it worries me.
well, what then?
what can i do for you mr....watson?
hmmm?
that's right; convict without trial ... habeas corpus.
why do you ask that?
i've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
i got the good chocolate, alvy.
where what was.
then it's time we were heading home. three years is...
i'm self-centered, i'm weak - i don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
main bus...
it all seemed to make sense until box.
ready?
thanks, hon. time to shove off.
what about guinan? what has she told you about me?
you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say . . .
harder.  concentrate harder.
you remind me of me when i was...i guess i was never like you. so cute. so questioning.
i've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
oh, you dawg you. better not be my nurse!
how'd you find me?
say something it's too quiet.
what do you mean -- sex equality?
no.
tell me about yourself.
my yeoman will show you to your quarters.
... the power?
screw you.  for all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
it's me... elizabeth.
they become complicated... messy.
oh, i'm fine.
no... jason... please...
because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
really?
we'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
it's true then?
what elders?
--i know what i'm talking about. i'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  guess i'll be going.
did you like it that much?
you know how to work a radio, don't you?
we didn't do nothing, eddie.
keep painting.  promise me.
fuck it!  i think you better leave.
shit! go!
it is ibrim, i, i am a sorter.
people think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. otherwise we wouldn't do it. after all, we're not fucking stupid. at least, we're not that fucking stupid. take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. when you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. got no money: can't get pished. got money: drinking too much. can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. got a bird: too much hassle. you have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
i believe in you, me, and rock and roll. and i'm not too sure about you lately.
we should be done by the weekend.
about thirty million to one.
do you want know the real reason why i became a bounty hunter?
here, officer, take me in. i'm clean. i didn't do it. got a ticket once in jersey. that's all. honest, officer.
i don't know.  at a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  my central nervous system was telling me something. jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so i could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what i like to do anyway.  and i'm chipper because you finally showed up.  i thought i'd cook for us. tequila and eggs sound good?
is he? yeah, i thought so, too. i tried to laugh, but i couldn't. it stuck in my throat.
okay, gotcha. what did you think i was going to ask?
i need a typewritter.
pretty good. sticking with hot water.
she finally got in--
i got paid by the word! no! your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
thanks again, sam.
you meant that, but you meant the other, too.
tommy, we have these...
i thought he was in prison, in england.
no, i can't. i've already convinced both mom and dad to come.
are you alright?
...i'm not sure that's pete.
you got it on the board.
have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat i'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
for god's sake, what's happened?
mr. reiss-- i need a quarter--
i just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  of you both!
i want to rent a movie.
these hallucinations i'm having. i think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  one who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
emergency transmitter?  what happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
i wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
wadda you think?
i am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  now: what happened to him?
well, i keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. i mean, what hell's goin' on? what are we doin' over here?
how much you got?
you a woodcutter?
a real space cadet. i wonder if she'll narc on us...
i'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what i have to say.
marvin says that rex's will is four years old. he never redrafted it.
it smells good.
yes!  my father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
there's this native broad works in the laundry. i don't know if you've noticed.
thank you.
if this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? or is their entire ship automated?
please don't make me say it again.
you got to go back now!
yeah.
no. i just need some space, maybe.
no.
it's not serious, it's just training. you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
can you help me get her back?
not lately it isn't.
your pictures. can i see 'em?
not always.  but i want you to know i'm very grateful for what you did for me.
did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday?
but not nice enough to marry--eh?
you forgot the "now i'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. see usually that comes before the, "it's over" step. and it always, always comes before the "you can go" step.  what is over?
-- and take this with you.
no!  no police.  they'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  they'll kill us. we've seen their faces.
there's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
so you were alone.
and you're from the future too?
well, listen, king.  could you take her up to about eight hundred?  that'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
something's up wi...
it's where situations like these lead, claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  now there are certain measures you can take --
i was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. reckon they sell toothpaste?
worf! i'm going to need at least five minutes!
silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
you lost a man we wanted for some time.  it was very incompetent on your part, officer.
how ya feelin'?
just souvenirs.  towels and stuff.
it's really a wretched morning... wretched. i can't get myself right. i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle. my face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can i dim myself down, leon? suggest something. i am so bored with this face. i wish i had someone else's face. whose face would you have if you had your choice? oh, well, i guess one gets the face one deserves.
sophie.
and the food sucks, i know.
ellen, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
levi? who names their kid levi --
the reason i can't be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and i may have to help out.
go on. get in your tent. you don't know nothin'.
she's just standing around -- not doing much.
you do not want to be here.  go home to your father.
wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? where's she work?
i'm ready to do it.  and i'm going to be here more than two weeks.
nobody. a boy who works in a grocery.
ah... peter finch.
morning, officer.
that's my point! you see man...burning at his absolute. to see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. that's what i'm driving at. you get me?
this used to be my specialty. i was good in a living room.  send me in there, i'll do it alone. and now i just... i don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because i couldn't share it with you.  i couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  i missed my wife.  we live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  i love you.  you complete me.
no.  it's unhealthy.
you?  you think you're the only one?  i've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
i know what's on my birth certificate.  you heard from daddy?
now let me fill you in.  you can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
i was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
thank you, your honor. we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana, u.s. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code: 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' and, your honor, having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the xerox form.
what...
keep it.
heather, this is sara risher over at new line.  how are you?
doesn't that scare you?
what are you saying?
you gotta help me. okay? this girl i told you about? diana? she's from the five towns. she's jewish. she won't go out with me alone. can you believe this shit? she's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. she's never been out with an italian before. she says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  you believe this shit? but you gotta see her. i mean, she's beautiful.
well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
how much does it cost?
how's the print coming?
elaine, i mean the mission has to be aborted.  this ship should never have passed fsa inspection.  this thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
bob, where you going?
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
that's what they call the repository.  every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
she's a dab hand with a racquet, your friend.
yes.  without question.
i leave that in your hands.
you get a vcr with the membership.  ... for a short time until you get your own.  listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  see if you're interested.
precisely.
yeah?
what do they do in the white churches, mama?
i wonder if his cabin is still available?
yes.
son-of-a-bitch. how the hell did you get oklahoma-michigan?  nobody ever had oklahoma-mi... how the hell'd you do it?
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. he made eagle scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  oh, norbert--promise me that paul has not gone into the park!
this fella nicoli's got a record in france, walter.  he's wanted for questioning in the murder of a french cop.
well, i was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  there's a lot of money in there. lot of money in there, and i'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
finish the inscription, idiot!
you think that could possibly be a full time job? how many hair colors could there be?
you sleep in that?
i'm -- i'm with a friend.
yes!
a gentleman would offer water.
they don't expect to get what they're asking.  let's make an offer.
well... why did you have to suck their dicks? why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week, jack, and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian ... now, if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
shit!
cut him loose?
hmm.  primitive ventilation.
too complicated.
i feel like we've been at war, charles.
you'd better get out of here!  kevin's coming back!
what?
blood sample? how close did you get to that thing?
look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and i aim to keep it that way. now i got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
you must realize, captain -- we have lost much here -- i, my husband. gaston -- his wife and son.
what happens now?
why, do you think we're going to?
you know i can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
she's gone, leon.
i love you.
patience, lad.
yes, eve. that would be good.
i wish to possess what you have now.
well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
it was a long time ago... i met him at this place called moke's... we... became friends... he told me about a job...
what will they do to you?
how ya doing?
i know, mom.
it's over, evelyn. it's all over
that you were fired.
i'll call the police.
is this charles?
your name is <u>beetle juice</u>?  yecch! that's as bad as <u>deee</u>lia <u>deee</u>tz.
and what are you thinking we should do now?
you mean he was colored?
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. somebody who'd been to this island before.
you can't say that....
more concerns than that?
no.
what's that mean, no employment certificate?
alright we're clear.
tagged a couple of cops. did you kill anybody?
i don't think so. their fix gave us the heads up and jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
no, there's only one report to complete.  i'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow.
bingo?
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you.
almost quaint.
when are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, don?
that's cool.
i went and looked at some babies just now.
i think you're right.  is there anything i can do to make it up to you?
i do a poaching number. six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. in 8 minutes, i could cater a goddamn wedding. plain but flavorful. and it's a good way to show off my hollandaise sauce ...
i can't even take a shower here.
can we talk price?
no!
join us, commanders.  now what's the disposition of the fleet?
apparently not.  look, it's a shit storm here right now.  when are you coming back?  i don't know what to tell people any more.
and?
because i'd be to blame, right?
scott.. i -
keep the goddam blanket on.
why?!  i think she's very attractive.
...their damned souls will be ours.
very hurtful.  your mother tell you to say that?
you probably.							 *
... a falcon?
i'll... take your word for it. so who are you, then?
are you in the service?
oh you do, huh?
maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
i have a purpose.
good.
for god sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  you look like a damned slave!  it's damned humiliating.
when you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? who did you call?
okay... you tell me why --  "you're dying here."
claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  if you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
you deserve to die alone for what you've done.
what happened to your shades?  someone finally step on 'em?
my parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. she's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
no. but at one point you did repeat something though. a phrase. you must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
why don't we talk inside?
you didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
got it.
without disrespect, look around you.  we overflow.  as do our courts.
let me ask you a hypothetical question: if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence?
make an exception?
the sounds, but not the language. we would be responding in gibberish.
maybe caen.
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
you never want to find out.
i'm so sorry.  krieger was my call.  i've never worked with him.  i'm sorry, ethan.
now what can you want with me, erik the "viking"?
i couldn't say anything.  i just stood there, hating her.
that morning.  he was talking to me and leon about marriage.
you excited?
no, it is.  look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a space ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy!  you are his toy.
how did i get here, how did you bring me back?
flip.  you're the closest thing i got to a friend around here.  tell me something.  you think i'm crazy?
well... you see, the problem is --
relativity, yes. we can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. the ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
thank you, john.
no?
you hear my okay?
what's the problem?
what?
hey, what'd you do that for?
i won't say, no, wait, claudia --
mrs brown.
they sabotaged me.
you paid off thirty grand i never owed.
well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney. maybe you can ask her.
like it or not.
seance.
sit down here.
i didn't build the fucking thing.
...rings a bell somewhere. so what?
you have to help me
it's been awhile.  i'll take your word.
it's too neat. things ain't that neat. it makes me mad. that somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. don't that piss you off?
is he good?
do what?
you're the man chang told me about! you're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, father perrault!
yeah, i have something i've been meaning to give you.
look at those korean motherfuckers across the street.  i betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
you wish.
good point.
do you want more rice?
i just heard.
i wish i could go.
how long?
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
i thought you were...for a while.
no shit.  they expensive?
four plus myers.
you'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
oh.
mace!  you're a life-saver.
oh, what?... your servant, sir.
two-all after six.
i'll just be a minute.
that's never been one of my problems.
you getting into bed to think about yellow?
... the point is i know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  but, this was a fat guy.  the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. and, writing on the walls happens all the time.  it's like the fashionable thing to do.
why shouldn't we? if we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
where'd they take lisa?
you know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
ten. laughlin's going to take us across at four a.m.
i had to promise, capital p, never to take it off -- otherwise i'd give it to you.
we're all the same really. our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
it was not -- it was murdo's. those mckendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
it's crazy in there. what's wrong with that doctor? he keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
somebody was in here.
what did he say?  what did he say?
there's nothing like them in the fossil record, i'm sure...okay, so they predate the fossil record...  that'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  right.
like big lizards.
trade re1ations.
dad?
hey -- russki -- russki! look at those bublichkis! over here!
well, since i'm not only your father, i'm also your friend; i had to get you two presents.
get the cops, somebody.
p.d. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
have a little snort?
well, guess what? i found betty... where she's been, anyway.
no, we're jake. but listen-
well, constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  we sent for the militia.
it won't hold.
are you my man?
say again?
you said 48 hours!
shit!
nerves of steel.
only three shocks. a chimp takes fifteen. this is going to be tres simple, no, gabrielle?
i'm going out for awhile.
what's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
listen, young lady... i know you don't like me -- i don't really care whether you do or not -- but i will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
there was a deer on the other side of the fence.
...no...no goddamn use.  i have a son, y'know?
"hmm" what?
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
don't you like us?
it's me sir.
how do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
-- last night i dreamt i was fifty years old and mary told me i was supposed to meet jill at the shop. it seared me shitless.
are you all right?
si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
yes, i did.
after the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
what'll happen to us, nell?
i don't know.
that big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
on your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
he'll kill them.  he'll kill every last one of them.
i mean, i can stay a few more minutes.
she's probably ten years older than you.
how about calling it a night?
this is insane.
the trees.  the flowers.  nice.
what?
which presumably means...
that's the problem! how can i find john g. when i don't know what's going on?! how did you get me into this?!
selfish attitude?  i'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
i don't want to "save" you. i just want to be with you. i love you. i love you!
get out!
he's lying.
we need guns.
it seems that the english care more about you than the french.
we had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  after that we fought with bows and arrows. then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
that, harry? that's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
what was the nature of your relationship with dr. paley.
thank you.
your line, george!
okay...
they must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
i mean bad.
i wish i had that luxury. i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go, because you won ' t.
doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. clanton came in an hour ago, they switched over to poker.  tried to get him to bed but he just won't let go.
you're off, you know?  you're way, way off.
the game's almost over, peter, and you're running out of time.
on the day i went away.
that thunder's sure somethin'.
you're not going to do this?
but that's not a door.  the door's over there.
greek citizen. merchant navy.  obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. they probably stumbled across it just like we did.
stop. what about maserati boy?
okay, okay. you win.
i did my homework. your grandfather was a peach farmer.
sir, your transmission's fading.
very very. the photographs?
yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
i *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
did you kill her?
maybe.
you found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
what?
i'm sorry.  it's not up to me.
i'm sure we could find a country and western station.
what was it jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
no, felice, i'm not a cop. in fact, right now i've got as little respect for the police as you do.  i'm looking for a girl. a runaway. i need someone to help me.
[south america.]
i'm upside down. i know it. i'm gonna eject.
-- you know, i used to be a high fashion model. tried it for six months and almost freaked. makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
yes, you do. you have to go rescue all those people...
are you a warrior?
what's his name?
must you take those?
never should've let her play.
no!
the humpback was indigenous to earth. earth of the past.
the lighthouse?
please, don't do that...
what kind of band is this, anyway?
who, me? oh, no! don't bother about me! we're not hurt! isn't that right, skipper?
bastards...
they know you are tutsi!
vincent <u>farrell</u>, assistant u.s. attorney.  a passenger in this taxicab, and i'm reporting you to the dmv...
yes.
i was just being agreeable, now i've got to explain why?
that's a negative, starck.
it didn't go over 'til i turned her starboard!
i don't have any sugar either.
can a vampire feel love?
yeah.
no way that cocksucker's driving you.
which view?
i'll wish you a happy birthday now and i'll see you soon. all right, darling?
you like?  it's all yours.
...truck!
stop picking on him.
occupied france?
let's continue.
malkovich.
so what am i going to do! get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the world can get his beauty fucking sleep!
that's worse... just get out of here. walk out, leave everything.
not a problem unless you're gonna make --
damned if i know.
what are you doing?
last night?  i was at home.
no, you see, i <u>promised</u> them...i have to...i have to go and....
hi, lois. morning, jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. excuse me, mr. white, i don't mean to interrupt but ---
then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
you --  -- are in for a surprise.
my real father?  well, he was a flashback.
don't do this!
i'm sorry i couldn't come pick you up honey.
everyone okay?
that's enough!
brain. soul, i'm telling you, lotte. i was right inside him looking out. we're going to be rich.
huh?
sonofagun! look at this here!
not that poor.
do not seek the treasure!
you asked me what was missing.
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
oh.  one more thing.  this is personal.  i want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
a bride without a head!
what?
but back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. to them, he was a cash register. all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. especially remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
now listen to what i've got to say. i took up this profession when i was ten years old. in those days there weren't these modern machines. the films were silent. the projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. and you wound the crank all day long. it was really rough going! if you got tired and slowed down' boom! everything would go up in flames!
all right. you win. let's forget it.
this is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
and loving him means loving all of this.
t-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
don't fuck with me.
you're lying --
hello, mulvaney here...
whatís hunt doing on the tgv?
it looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
stop it.
like hell i will.
hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
stop throwing names at me.
where's my day book?
because it was going to fall.
hey, slinky?
leave him alone, tim.
--mine's better--
once i kicked, i swore i wouldn't let that happen again. i apprenticed a razor girl in osaka. went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
you want love on your own terms, don't you, charlie -  love according to your own rules. and if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
he, i'm r-red.  red s-strange.
you want unpleasant?  just wait, i can do much better than this.
do you know where you're headed?
see.  it's starting to come back, yeah?  you mind if i take a bath?
but king arthur was always your favorite.
do you really think i should go to the commune?
straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
how did you get this number?
not that i don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--i wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
what?
either of you seen dodge?
don't kid me.  you don't think she murdered mitchell.
good call.
the whole core of mars is ice.  the reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
dad, please stop.  please.  i'm sure i know what you're talking about.
no, we don't talk. i don't make bad bets. seventy-five, twenty-five. that's it.
not until ben is back inside!
what the fuck was that about?
oh, i could kill him! i mean really kill him. i actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
liz, do i have to spell it out for you?  lee oswald was no ordinary soldier.  that was no accident he was in russia.  he was probably in military intelligence.  that's why he was trained in russian.
we've got to dump shuttle.  he brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
pooh-bear. come on, man.  what is this?  it's me, danny. i thought we had a deal.
i want to arrest you for murder! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
yeah. it's just... something i gotta do, i guess.
was he a good man?
well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
i am dr. norbert woodly--a physician, a healer.  i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
we_re not all running away
you planned this --
i think this place stinks.
please don't mess me up with bandages, mrs. brenner.
think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's ford. how's that?
they look nice, i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? i might get laughed at. how much do you want for these muskets?
he's afraid of something.
it's just not working out, but i'm getting my own place in the city... and i've got it all planned out. it's something i've wanted to do for a long time...
diane court.
but surely, i mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles, and ...
something like that.
what?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
well, what're you going to do?
the goddamn sign on the wall. i can't do unauthorized work?  what am i suppose to do? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they gonna blame then?  they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
might at least have left me my pants!
i know.
i thought you were supposed to keep them.
alexander, i know your theory. the boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
she's... young.
he's mistaken.
he jumped into the ocean.
honey, this is nothing...i don't know what it is.  what did they....
nope.
the children.  the children hugh crain built the house for.  the children he never had.
well, i'd like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding...
there's no face really, nothing to work with.  big dots, that's all you'll get.
where do you think this goes?
so you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. and of course, the mpaa didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. what did you think?
i never wanted to be a mom.  then, sharing it with you was one thing. carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
maybe i should start making plans, is that what you think? start planning my memorial service? "begin to prepare for the inevitable."
with how many people?
but your body is in the world, isn't it?  if someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
what, baby?
they pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the germans land they'll lose their way.
well what do you think it is?
mrs. robinson?
there's a test, you know.
i couldn't find jane.  she wasn't at the restaurant.
no. her mother's awful worried about her. when she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. er, the girl, i mean!
i heard!  i heard!
yes, she committed suicide yesterday. that's not news. i heard about it last year.
i know.
did it look like this in your mind?
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship.
chilton has killed her, hasn't he? that slimy little bastard! we were so close with lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
all right, dear.
what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. a psychopath is not a professional. you can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. i mean, jesus christ, how old do you think that black girl was? twenty, maybe twenty-one?
wolfi!
this isn't a virus. it's a worm!
can we talk some more when you get here?
i'm afraid so. if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans... earth will remain in the second dark age... an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century.
and shaw?
don't be a fool. you lost your bag. the company'll make good. what's your name?
it is shameful -- infamous!  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador's house.
'course i was right. about what?
audrey?! is that you? hi, hello. you look, wow, uh, how've you been?
yes, you do, albert. talk or i'll kill you.
any leads?
the bed's all made up if you want to stay.
well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! they're playin' it as far away as mobile! the whole damn state's goin' ape!
huh?
is that what you think--
i know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  but what's this got to do with it?
mrs. teasdale, i'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency.
i don't like thinking about the accident.  i don't even remember it happening.  besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
fifteen and two thirds, actually.
do you have t.p.? t.p. for my bunghole?
it helps me to focus.  it centers me, helps me think.
just you.
i used to live in this house.
we're going to vegas.
oh. okay.  i'll catch ya tomorrow then.
aw shit.
i've been shit faced for like two weeks.
no uniforms.  no coats, even?  in this weather?
mm.
i guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
i'm heading in to work, baby. are you sure you'll be okay?
must have been hell, huh? zero cool?  a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system. you were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
it's a commercial area.  no one lives there.
i mean -- for a living.
have you ever had anal intercourse?
you fucking promised.
so josh...
it seems i've found a flaw, john  you.
no, no, no, no, no.
sir, if i may ... echo my concern ...
what'd they give you?  thorazine?  how much?  learn your drugs -- know your doses.
i was getting out of the car when i saw him in the mercedes.
who is that girl, anyway?
page 22, candy's big moment.
i guess we're about to find out. keep us slow and steady.
shit. i don't remember that at all.
charming chap.
do i get to kiss her too?
i'm gay. like you didn't know.
a glorified office block.  they keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
which one is it?
does it have a television?
well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. also, i checked on the otic solution. it was counter brand. no prescription needed.
he never ate the pre-nup, did he!
you read harry's new one? he says it's the best thing he's ever read.
all right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of cn-20 down there. nerve gas the whole nest?
that must be four thousand yards.
jesus, sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  me and alterez are on it, okay?
well done, lad.  stout heart.
you know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
how long has it been?
yes. from the highest authority. there are two conditions. the u.n. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
this?  this is you only weapon? your puny faith?
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
are you alright?
tell me the settlement is right there! riddick, please!
i shoulda sent you instead of jack.
i've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
same as they done in mexico.
sounds perfect. i can park my car back there?
... is over.
nun? was ist? haben sie's herausgefunden?
i may not be a pro bowler, but i'm no amateur man. sheila moves closer to theo.
your earrings?
the left.  it's more natural.  hey, i've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  what would that be made of?
i already did.  no answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  i'm keeping them there.
i'm not much of a critic.
i heard you weren't coming.
what's goin' on?
i had everything. once.
yeah.
hurry up with those papers.
machines?
i don't like the sound of that.
are you okay?
what?
about time!
i said, the old man's screwy!
oh, yes.  he's found peace.
in that case, maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him.
sure she is. that's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. oh you're good, ted. you're a real piece of work.
what fence? who?
watch it, brody.  you're ruining the shot.
ah damn.  damn.
it's because he comes off as the underdog.
well, it doesn't matter, does it? i'm getting out.
what do you want to live in a black neighborhood for?  motherfuck gentrification.
just a bat! i'm fine! just a bat! sorry!
road's in!
i said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
yes, and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s. convention.
are you all right?
you are too cruel to da mayor, it isn't right.
have you seen hugo?
that's 'fronkonsteen.'
sit down.
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera. down somewhere in there scavenging around.
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
liberating isn't it?
you mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
don't hurt me.
well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
you could hear them?
what about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
what happened?
the sweep is just routine, not even police action.  i'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
i'll wear a bloody kimono if i want to.
they won't --
catherine. listen to me. i have to find a rope. i have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
meanwhile, you still live in new york?
we did one point seven million in total revenue...
what's the password?
ten thousand dollars.
boat five -- wickwire, cozad, vinyl, intagliata, ayers, and wise. lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer.  follow his orders to your death.
my daughter, i ask only...
now get on with it.
how do you know?
no!... yes, a little. you see hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
put it down as a gesture to love.
you found nothing?
didn't think you would.  i'm going to go make the coffin.
not anymore. oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in long beach, but we lost it.
that was fast. well, did you at least enjoy it?
i checked the medical database.  no one else is even close.
well, personally, i never went for church names.
it’s just a scratch.
are you sure?
they had a pattern to follow...
this is the only place in rome where i thought -- i believed -- i was wholly in power.
leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
is that what's been bothering you -- miss olsen? that's ancient history.
do you hear anything?
jesus christ, pops, don't start with this shit.
it's not your fault.
the men. do any of them still live around here?
that's what we are, we keep each other on track.  prior to this day, we've postured.  we've procrastinated. we've pretended.  we've -- well i can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
three games to two. but if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. i've been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old.
i know i left them there.
look.
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that's what i would've done.
75% power.
bless us o lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through christ the lord.  amen.
i'm thinking i might walk tonight, frank.
you couldn't.
yes.
yes, they give me headaches. i have a headache.
yes, jon.  that karl.
you two....
and now he's addicted to painkillers.
you're going to take a year off? join the peace corps -- ?
movie star hookers.  whatever you desire... it's fleur-fr-lis again.
stop.
admiral, they're reducing speed.
diss digg. i'm curious if you have it?
april 14, 1912.
aagh! no wonder you're batty. would it be imposing too much upon you if i asked you to do a little work today? just to sort of break the monotony?
because it's true. after thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
look, there's no fuckin' way i'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. then we might have something to talk about. now step away from the car.
don't.
will you come with me?
he will fight you forever. but what does he fight for? freedom first, and peace. so grant them.
but you won't. you're a good man detective. we think alike. i know you need my help. and i know you know i need your help.
tell us about it.
why waldman? he of all people should have cheated death!
what is this, man?
does that make it right...
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic.  turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  they figure we've finally gotten saddam off their backs.  they brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... i'm their new best buddy.  america number one, joe. but there's something the shi'ites can't figure out:  they can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow americans, left me out in the desert.  they can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost.  it's almost as if they were iraqi spies, or something.  and i've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the iraqis.  see how i mean?
game's over. last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  you're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
depraved? my mistake.
it's on the table where i left it! what the hell are you doing?! hurry up!
don't you want to go to the airport?
are you kiddin'? did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? did you see the papers? "lamotta on vice rap." everybody likes a shot at the champ.
what is it?
what dya mean, don't worry about it. of course i'm gonna worry about it, i can't fuckin' see.
thanks, but i think i'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
get down!  he'll see.
you -- sent them away. without even letting me say goodbye?
what happens?
may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
that's sarah?  i can see what you mean.
details, pokrif. from what i saw he had an incredible body.
despite the academy award?
didn't know you cared so much.
you know that song?
both, sir.
things went badly in palermo?
now, stop fucking around. the others, the old ones?
at least i let you tag along.
we lost a kid about a month ago to fairview.  i don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
it's not.
how long until we reach the fleet?
really?
oh, you were excellent tonight, pony.
just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
if i tell you, i might not be able to finish it.
didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
i think i'll take them. 
she's already got her doubts.  i have to act like nothing's wrong.
i do different things on different days.
people sure like those misery books.
hmm.  it seems you left something in our safe.
i was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
that bag's almost empty.
i didn't know you were out.
jesus christ...
that's a matter of interpretation--
this can't be my last duty here.  it will go on and on.
that's enough!  you will answer the question... or face the consequences!
then we're outside the kogus. then what?
nobody. i love you, remember?
it's important.  we had a little trouble in chicago today.  one of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
but it's true.  i have no faith.  it's strange.  when that gun was pointed at my face tonight, i was surprised, but never frightened.  it was as if i knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment i didn't care about anything.  not eve my own life.
karl? did you put this in regan's bedroom?
i just can't stand this.
when you won that scholarship, i was proud of you.
you're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, ms. grey.  three words: are mutants dangerous?
big bust!  he confiscate their water pistols?
<u>what do you want</u>?
i don't know. the traffic was pretty loud. i only heard one thing – apple core.
i know. that's the amazing part of it. i mean, it wasn't like cirque du soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. i'm going to sound like a hallmark card.
thanks for taking care of this for me.
this monster escaped from cryo- prison this morning.
look at you, cutey! what are we doing?
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
be better if i could talk to him in person.  but he's not an easy man to get to.
like where?
yeah.
is this the first one?
it'll be the biggest score yet.
okay. i'm on the bridge.
that's okay, buddy-boy.  now like i was saying, i'm in this joint on sixty-first -- and i think i got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the ice show --  -- and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink.
gone.  destroyed.
you back this mission, and i'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
no, don't jack, don't.
we must abandon.
no.
but, sir...
you got it.
yes, that's true.
oh, what bullshit? what, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
i can't say i like your seagulls much, either. i come all the way up here to...
it was wonderful.
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
oh, please, mike...
sir.  i thought those records were sealed.
ronnie... yeah, so.
and no ac.
every geek here's got a thing for lisa. but that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
when i was twenty-seven years old, in jersey city, i asked a woman to marry me. she had red hair. she smelled a jasmine. she wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
eight.
see?  you want custody of my job? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i've served my time?
who are you?
another fucking magician. jesus.
no, sir.
might wanna fasten your seat belt, jack...
okay ...
god, i haven't seen you since the wedding.
my partner and me robbed the bank in turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. my partner there caught one a ways back, and i think he kicked off while i was looking for this damn canyon. you're dawson, ain't you? i'm tex larue.  used to ride with ry morris. you know him. well, andy sims told me there was a hideout here, so i headed for it. hope you don't mind.
what are you talking about? so i've got a job. so what?
at the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. alone.
nah. you just relax. how's the book?
then she wasn't in the car.  <u>say</u> it.
hey!
he has taken the presidential suite.
forward motion, captain...!
you just fucked a total stranger?
yoda, i must know.
thank you. i hope you'll forgive me, captain, but the present french administration has not always been so cordial. may i present miss ilsa lund?
i know, but i hung around, 'cause i figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
whatever you say.
wait a minute! that was thirty years after daddy. do you think...?
why do i feel that you know what's going on?
went out before service.
why?... what do you mean?... why???
you're to be discharged tomorrow. will you be all right?
she, she's alone. just go. take the gun and go into amy's.
they canned me.  well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
i wish you'd make sure.
you want a drink?
simple.
and, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
"i was a posthumous child. my father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
of course!
i don't know what they teach at harvard, but i think i'm pretty good enough the way i am !
sorry.
aren't you?
what did you think then?
well, that's a relief.  thank you.
yeah, right.
put up your kickstand, freak.  start talking, or we're out the door.
ok.
and how many lives have you destroyed?
alright, i will.
what's that about?
we had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  she felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... you're upsetting yourself.  would you like something?
no, i'm just gonna walk around.
ok. same again?
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
okay, let's go through what happened. we're in the place, everything's going fine. then the alarm gets tripped. i turn around and all these cops are outside. you're right, it was like, bam! i blink my eyes are they're there. everybody starts going apeshit. then mr. blonde starts shootin' all the -
are you all right?
all right, i drove to the beach. norma, you don't want me to feel i'm locked up in this house?
let's just say i...eh...i'm involved.
he called me chicken.
consuelo?
vince -- is she... okay?
what the ... ?
rub your ears.
what did you see?
and we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
i'm all excited --
i guess i'm supposed to do it in the morning.  identify him.
thanks. i'll be there. about seven-thirty?
hello.
shut up, before you lose them all!
no no no.
yes, james.
that you, boy?
it's time to make amends.
why can't i have a bank account?
what're you doing? what about the car?
you were listening outside the parlor window.
it would be great if i'm crazy.  if i'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  i'll never have to live underground.
are you sure she don't know about the money?
why only fifty percent, ruth? why not ask for a hundred percent?
fear. the fear of being poor i guess, just like you, darien... but that's all gonna change sweetheart. i'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
good evening, baxter.
that's right.  he wants to share. needs an audience.  this is one sick puppy.
none of your business.  am i still bleeding?
look, charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
what?! how can you --  i'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much, but i happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say, it's wrong and no matter what i do, it's wrong... i'm sorry i'm such a disappointment to you.
well, put it down and come in!
hey caitlin...  break his heart again this time, and i'll kill you. nothing personal.
speak english will ya.
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones.
big mess every time.
a brick house says you divorced him.  i'll put you on your honor. bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  and i'll take your word for it.  now you tell me the truth.  because you cannot lie to me.  what's your name?
i expected it to be bad, you know.  i took a human life... but i slept like a baby that night.  i never gave it a second thought.
i've been thinking about it for a long time.
yeah. although it hardly fits. i'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
well, i've been trusting you all this time, haven't i? we agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
maybe you should...
i chose not to choose life: i chose something else. and the reasons? there are no reasons. who need reasons when you've got heroin?
joe or what?
rose, who were those scoundrels in birmingham?
alex, i think you're freaking out. greg's gone, i'll give you that.  and maybe he's in trouble.  but it's not arcade that's doing it...
i really don't want to put this on again. won't you bring it up?
what happened?
what's up?
you already know the answer to that. i want this town to be safe and happy again --
i don't think so.  what about skydiving? a crank call to billy graham?
he... he just does.
you're on your way up, buddy-boy. and you're practically out of liquor.
what is it?
what's going on?
oh, be still my heart.
you are not my priest, aramis!  you would not be, even if i had one.
there's still time, take me up on my offer.
oh, no. oh, christ. no, you don't.
very instructive
so?
their radio's out too.  gennaro said to stay put.
hi.
i wanted it over fast.  it felt dirty to not tell you.
confess what?
well, nobody has to sell.
listen. have i got a proposition for you, superman. i mean i owe you one, you know? now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
you could sue the shit out of her, ya know. that kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. you could own that fuckin' place.
-- jack, what am i doing? i'm standing here, aren't i?  shouldn't that be enough? that i made the trip?
i've got an idea.
got me out of trouble.
we have henekin, kirin... very good, sir.
st. michael's.
what do you mean?
here.  a transport plane is due at eleven.  once i put him on it, it's all over.
real genuine guy.
bent?
and they have very mixed feelings about women.  they hate them in a way.  one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  they can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
that's embarrassing?
oh, thank you.
you probably don't.  how could you?  you're so terrified of your own emotions ...
well, elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  thanks a lot, bigmouth. i knew you were a squid the moment i laid eyes on you. in my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  he's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. he just saw his chance and he took it.
why... ?
hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
am i gettin' the car?
george?  you better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  we're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
i told you the facts! he abandoned us -- those are the facts.
i do trust you, sailor. like i ain't never trusted nobody before.
so, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
fuck you, nut case. where were you last night?
bye.
who is this?
you're ok?
write. 'cause i, i have written some things.
elaine!
norman, this isn't about you.  this is something that's happening to me.  it's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
i gotta catch up with him, laurie!
oh... it's a game.
i don't know.
i don't get it, you get a scholarship to nyu, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
you go to heller, did i ask you to talk to him?
you might have killed him!
mmm  you never know.  they might.  he's just trying to do the nice thing.
want some coffee or tea?
i'm working with you because of that memo...
so waddaya feel like doing tonight?
you know why they're turning on me? they're not serious about power, that's why.  they're playing with power.  they're forgetting the national interest.  in the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  they wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. all they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
i'd never do that.
as soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. does he understand that? we're supposed to tell him. are you conscious?
it's a starting place.
why?
no doubt about that one.
you're not crazy, by the way.
the back-up does the same thing.
duval. dr. peter duval. top brain man in the country. ever hear of him?
cut that out, copper.  nauls?  what's taking you?!
get ready to go.
why are we doing this?
oh hell, forget it.
he's inside the house?
well... maybe...
dancing with you.
i'm sorry, but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland. you know how she loves to ski.
captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors...
you don't remember.
i'm the creator.
bread?
i speak to you on ze phone, non? you have a special interest in music?
okay.
what am i looking for?
i am going to get my nut on this trip, miles. and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
he was caressing.
oh, kitty, i don't know. this is so last-minute... eddie is in new york...
they knew our level of development. if, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
who is it?
...that was a dr. david gruber's office...
it's called mummification. you're dead when they do this
i've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  i know you're mixed up in all this, dude, and i don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  that's your business.  all i'm saying is, i want mine.
i'm just thinking out loud here, but... two million in a briefcase?
things have been kind of stressful lately.
her life is in your hands.
so ... how's the food over there in china, mr. nixon?
hello, faust!
why? when?
what's that, frank?
why not?
we do the operation after i finish. i can't risk not finishing... i thought you understood what i was doing.
leave me out of this.
"you can't shoot 'em!" i like that.  i bet she led you on good, didn't she?  taking you up to the house to hang drapes. oh that's a good one. bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. then me busting in like some wild bear. ha! bet you had a fire going under you.
no.
that's right?
how d'you know what i'm like?
can't you tell me now?
nine?
a card?
katherine?... katherine who?
who's he?
he's from new york city. that one, too.
coffee? milk? or how about a little cocoa?
oh, i’m hearing you, alan. that’s not the problem. the problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  and i don’t care how low on the totem pole i start, i will get it back...  so do yourself a favor and don’t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your french country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
or a cover up!  jesus, bill, don't you have enough proof of the fbi's complicity now?
you may not like it, but this is the world we live in, alex.  little grey men with little grey hats.
you cannot die.
it's short, huh?
what terrific story?
he was a wealthy man?
thank you, exposition. only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
'my father's house has many mansions.'
you think i'm dumb, don't you?
thanks for eating it. i don't know why i even pretend i can cook.
but silvia i did not care for much. his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! oh, when can we see another?
what do you mean, jack?
i can't do that.
i asked you a question.
demolition man.
and attractive in a hammy sort of way.
gimme that. that doesn't concern you.
mookie, you must think i'm stupid or something.  you're gonna run outta here and i won't see your black ass for another week.
just. i don't know why. i'm asking.
you could do that?
tom, i never had trouble getting credit from you before. when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted. now i come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
do it.
why not?
what the fuck do they want with me?!
so, larry, how have you been?
go ahead, driver! ball park!
yeah, i see her.
right, but let me explain something about that rug--
well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. i'll tell you what. let's do it tonight. right now.
what, what what are you doing here?
all right.  since you put it that way.
reed's disaster.  you know, i half- think he did this to me on purpose.
it was wrong, henry! it shouldn't have happened! the bastard deserves to die.
all right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! what can she say?
we all expect the world to be fair. as if we have some right t...
i've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  do you know who grandma death is?
great, with the occasional stabs of shame. now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
you've made your point perfectly clear, mr. kane.  good day.
which one was that?
yo -- i ain't mad. i'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an' paulie knows it.
asteroids!  chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
are we talking about me, or chess?
me either.  i tell you, i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
i'm still going in.
intuition. it doesn't make you yoda. like tonight. you killed that guy tonight. but i knew you would.
say again?
dentist?  we been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
i can't wait until i can drive next year. i walk every day. it's such a drag.
have you ever been on television?
oh, damn!  that's it.
jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
the old man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  he has one just like it.
as you were. lieutenant...?
nazis talk about it all the time.
what do you think?
i can't control mine- i'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
what'd ned say?
you're fucked in the head.
nothing is going on with us, is it?
i want to buy you a drink.
look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
so what gems do you have in your collection?
hello.
right.
no, i guess not.
you know, a chigro... part chinese, part negro...  chigro.
shit. it's neil prescott's car.
mr. mccleery?
excuse me sir. are you a guest of the club?
i didn't know there would be a quiz, george.
yes, sir.
well, i don't know. i—
besides, daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
oh -- i'll take the same, i guess. and coffee.
just what the hell is wrong with you?
so, what causes this?
i been watching you.  you done good. invested wisely.  respectable businessman now.  just like you always wanted.
you think the chemists that invented agent orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'boy, i really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  you think oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
i didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
easy micheal.
but keaton had. edie finneran was his extradition advisor. she knew who he was and what he knew.
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway?
they wouldn't have changed the security setup.
we'll talk about it more on thursday.
are you sure about all this?
right on the button.
what? deep down inside?
don't leave me now.  i fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
what do you mean?
mr. morton's with american express... he's...  i can tell jim what you do...?
lowe's car-?
believed what?
that's a good thing?
don't worry sunshine. bud and i had a little talk. we came to an understanding.  i want you to go back to him. soothe him. help keep his head straight. okay?
we know.
the villa straylight. home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as wintermute. if we can get molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple mute's defences, the case can destroy it in cyberspace.
thank you so much.  you have to let me pay you something --
can you arrange a meeting?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
don't bother.  i'm taking a trip.
a shooting war!
no, no.
that's a fantastic idea --
o.k., cowboy.
i'll make one for you.  i live there.
what're you gonna do, waste your talent? why not use it to make something worthwhile. you can do that, you know?
...where is the back end coming from?
it's tuesday. you said to call. when do i get my 45 minutes?
going where?
but your daughter is still alive.
they are all duchesses here... thousands of duchesses... and i am going to tell them.
oh my lord!
you gave her gifts.
no i don't.  i don't take orders from smurfs.
what!
well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  from this point forward, i want all press matters coordinated via my office. i'll be god-damned if i'm gonna watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. him or the president.  this my shade?  "midnight mahogany"? 'cuz i'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like ronald reagan here.
look, sam, don't take it the wrong way when i tell you we won't be doing this again.
ellen, this is the biggest thing i've ever done, but i've gotta do it.
cosmo. many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, i was happy. when i told rose i was marrying rita, she was happy.
yeah.  so where's the high school?
what have you.  we'll, uh--
look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
no, i...
serious. when a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. i don't want to be serious -- and i especially don't want you to be.
steve. thank god you came.
how's everything?
kind of. you didn't know?
scoundrels? they weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
ooooooh.  hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. i've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. yes. that's the smartest thing you ever did, westley, not to contest that annulment. that's satisfactory, isn't it? yeah. well, it ought to be. oh i'm not complaining. it was dirt cheap.  don't fall out of any windows.
what are you looking at him for?  any objections, sefton?
all we need is a couple days, henry. a couple days and we'll get lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
it did.
it's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  i had a father like that.
no, that's not what i'm thinking.
that is a damn lie and you know it. every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get junior to do it. every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell junior to do it. boy, you ought to grow up.
forget it, frances. you're not driving.
no... like a psychiatrist.
i don't know titles.
you're not very good at this, are you?
you feel better now, right?
shh.  mommy's here.  what is it?
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  that's if she can learn to bake.
we'd need charges.
it's just a shot to calm you.
all right then.
that was my favorite part!
yeah.  why else would he come back to australia?  if he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
i don't know what you're talking about!
jesse?
see what i mean?  a question please...'is this what you call living?'
what did she look like?
i like him.  i think he's a sweet guy.
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
faux goose down.
all right, vader's boss...
yeah.
you held back stern.  you held back the one man most important to my business.
they dragged me downstairs.  i thought they were going to kill me.
zander, no...!
squid?
she won't? why not?
lucky for you.  well, there you go, guys. don't spend it all in one place. oh ... you want to count it, jack?
i haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
shut up.
you know, dear, i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. just tell us. we'll believe you.
just wondered what?
not me, man.  i'm no drug dealer, what you think.
earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, ted.
is it that funny?
we don't have foibles.
what the hell.  the next year, tiebreaker for the division, in boston, yanks down two to nothing, bucky dent steps to the plate.
yes?
nice to have you here.
every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
don't you think there's too much gold?
are you asleep?
an ancient japanese ceremony.
i'll open mine now.
so it's all worked out perfectly...
federal express?
i'm at your service.
ok, good. that's good. thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
alex swan. my brother. the other two are called taylor and leveau.
i got to get downstairs.  the c.i.a., they want to see your body.
you mean the shaman?
how much do you make a week? what's your salary?
you got it, stud.
two million dollars?
she's in a wheelchair?!
yes, it is.
my screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
i'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that i mind... i mean, i'm ok with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
i'm feeling fine this morning.
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
the sea is lovely, dark and deep.
is it a star?
i know, but you're broke. where are you?
great line.
yes, sir.
i'm lonesome. i'm lonesome so i'm a drunk. i'm lonesome so i'm a dope fiend. i'm lonesome so i'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. poop, i say, poop! i've heard it all and i'm sick of it, sick to death.
amber...
i'm sorry that i am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place i have inhabited for the past month.
no. for a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
quit my job.
i do it because i love you.  because everybody i loved you.  mommy -- wher- ever she is -- susan, quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
who are you?  why is the green destiny in your possession?
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
so you were looking for a new challenge.
but happy. very happy, peggy sue.
and your point is?
christ said it in the bible, he said - suffer the little children, i want to suffer like a little child.
why didn't anybody tell me?!
ya want the truth -- ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
how?  how can you help me?  with your flowers and your perfect life...
i think you better tell us.
you're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
if your asking if i nailed her the answer is no.
exceeding fair.
wow, i guess i hit a nerve.
...that's right.
sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
i'm sorry, baby. i can't help it.
in any event, i will not beg for mercy.
i am prepared to accept the terms, mr. newcombe.
what -- what's on your mind?
just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a j?  i feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you jonah.  what is marjoram? does anyone know?
i just -- realized that i didn't know anything about you.  i was interested.
guilty.
looks like about a mile. reckon she'll make it?
i don't have one.
oh, uh-huh.
look,dirt!
the families who control the casinos?
valo massa... chacha hamas.
i see.  so this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  you came here with a purpose.
looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  maybe some kind of a rodent.
i guess skipper neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
yoooo, that's it.  you ain't as dumb as i think you are, roach.
hold your fire!
he may have a gun!
now what?
wait!  when can i see you again?
the bus'll pick you up over there.  uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
well, it's my plan. we're in this together.
sure.
then how did he find out about the device?
i thought maybe held gotten over that.
oh no, it's been much more than that.
you're right. only you can do that.
but why, if i'm not hurting you?
this is california. the richest, most populous state in america. and growing like a sonofagun.
i hate to turn on this light, you daddy's awake downstairs, but i have to take the chance.  buddy, please don't tell on me.
we'll be half-way down the road with the money.
winifred.
and this is your house.  wow.  the house of frankenstein.  i thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
'cause you like their second one, you said, pop, girls. etc.  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover.  you didn't see the cover though.
i had to get up anyway.
is there something else i can do for you?
i don't think i could ever learn to read that shit.  how long did it take you to learn english?
'scuse me?
boss, i made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
did you do everything i asked you to?
and tomorrow?
great.  thanks.  you gonna have one?
...leon’s not here. how did you get here? phil doesn’t know where i live.
i need to see snow.
bullshit.  you would've killed us anyway.
no, dammit.  it's a matter of life or death.
what are they like? what are they about?
oscar!  you poor kid!
come with me and i'll let her live.
how about some ammo?
but she's your *daughter*...
john and cynthia have been... "fucking".
you're all under arrest. open up!
is everything all right?
we're going with you. i mean, we're going too.
wait, wait...
this knife is filthy.
what are you lookin' at?
we got to make another copy of this. little life insurance.
a zillion, huh? that's a lot.
still wants to move out?
and yet you fired him.
it would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
when was the last time i wore pink?
are you alright?
love?  love's just a pretty way of saying, 'i want to sleep with you'.  love is bullshit.
sid, what happened?
erica.
oh no, nothing of the sort.
is that like luigi's?
plumb busted out. looks like the hard road finally got to mister lucas war hero.
don't give me no trouble now, pace, please. this ain't the easiest day in a long time. and what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? you seen his photo.
all right, just you; the others can wait in samoan jo's next door.
...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.
your handwriting -- nothing more naked. see -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
i heard about your sister, and i... understand your pain...
you've had today's water.
why did the chicken cross the road?
-- i have the authority. i am the commander-in-chief of the united states, and i say when we go to war!
you dropped a glass.
all right. 'cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
i don't think there's any sense in --
flynn!!
this has been a good year.
sandy? could i talk to you a minute?
right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
but...why?
it's working.
who'd you ever do a favor for? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
her name is gretchen.
let me go!
we can take your car.
he said he'd sponsor me.
the why'd the police let him go?
oh, dear.
...don't put it in your pocket.
this . . .
your brother stumbled upon adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash. and adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. he came to extort a second kid’s life. your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. there was no exhibition. just as you suspected. remember, deborah? “leon does his own prints. wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘art’”.  i should have paid more attention to your words. perhaps it’s the way you say them...
why?  what happened?
you're going to be ok, william. we just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
thanks, but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights.
but... betsy...
detectives!
david - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
--i'm not your source on that--
because i'm trying to build your self-esteem. you're far too sensitive.
originals?
what?
yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
you haven't told him yet...
where?
i have no privacy. even now! i'm crying and i can't stop and they won't go away. and now it's going to be another month!
what's my rap?
do you want to die?
but he was such a good cop.
do we have the range of renard’s plane?
this is evil -- evil, captain. we're all gonna die here.
madeleine --
cunt.
don't be mad. that was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
are you?
why are you carrying the dog?
what?  look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
what did gordon's tie mean?
stay for awhile. rest. i'll make coffee and breakfast.
the code's changed. we need artoo!
it's bluebells!
water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
from my father and nolan.
yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! you'll love your character!  bunny, bela's here.  look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>i need transvestites</u>!
no! i can't get out! they'll crucify me. i'll have to take the blame!
may i help you?
iraq, sir. we're over iraq.
scooby?
okay.
you're like your mother.  you love money.
okay.
i'll bet.
you'd better tell the captain. we've got to land as soon as we can. this woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
may i ask why...?
can't we hold him?
oh no. no, please.
who isn't?
she wasn't to blame, mr. dickson. it wasn't her fault. honest, it wasn't. i begged her to come up. she didn't—
what about this beetle guy?
but you never had a first date.
what...does it turn to?
you buckled up?  you cold?
better?
mostly.  armored cars can be hijacked.  trains can be derailed.  but nobody can get to us in flight.
tell me what in the hell's going on, elton!
your ego is colossal.
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos? that's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  careful of these tiles, they're slippery. valentino used to dance here.
who are the britons?
it hasn't adjusted.
i'm well, thank you.
this vacuum don't work.  where's the restroom?
ed, who is daniel davis?
how can you? i mean they're people.
i'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  let's talk about tomorrow. wanna do something?
don't worry, i can take it.
no!  no!  don't leave!  don't leave! you've gotta help us, please!  you don't know what it's like over here!
mouth's clean, too.
is there a room key?
not a one.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
but i've seen the deed.
george --
hey, baby, how ya doing?  you look beat.
maybe the warning system's out.
then go find a corner. i don't want you in my way.
just do like i tell you -- i'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
i like you.
is he sick?
i've only been here five. right now it feels like ten, but...
he can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  data, is it going to pass near any m-class planets?
you're not coming?
great! go back to your files. bye.
according to our current information, the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on gorik iv was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
and you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
that's ok, you'll figure it out.
and no elbows on the table!
what does he direct besides traffic?
that's just plain silly. your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. it's no good, man. you gotta get out there. the ladies want to love you, baby.
no, i mean they've gone. decamped.  split.  vanished.
well, mr. smarty-pants detective, your logic is specious.  what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it.
you've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
no. they don't.
good. i'll show you how, apey.
i'm really not very -
i wouldn't say that--  i'm glad he's dead--yes--i'd thought of killing him-- but i didn't--
so what's the point?
absolutely. the world is my oyster.  whatever that means. 
they didn't seem too good.
radar stealth mode checks out.  all right, there'll be less security north of the george washington bridge.  i'm taking her down.
get your hand off me.
what are you thinking?
yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. nobody expects you to be what you're not.
cos she loves <u>you</u>.  she wanted you to have a daddy to love.  even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
"hi, gina.  hi, sonny."
you're something else, dil, you know that?
an' little bill killed ned for what i done?
ya puttin' me on, right?
i wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
thanks.  will you fix my hair?
so will you?
what? nobody set anybody up.
oh, yeah.
what a touching story.
what are you doing?
stop it!
you sure you don't wanna...?  for old time's sake.  if you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
you're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. no one would notice if you disappeared. i've watched you for a couple weeks.
which way's out, man -- ?
this is where he vanished.
she might.
no.  it's nice and cozy.
with hypnocyl?
dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
then it's not an accident that they found us.
it's after five...
they wouldn't take me. i'm class iv-- i've got a heart defect.
...how do we explain that?  hey?  am i worried...?
stay out of it, carter.  you're going back to l.a.
can't it wait?
ricky?...that i don't care they stole the contracts?
take my horse and go to the compound. give this to mrs. wu.  she'll help you.  hurry!
hi.
i had to sneak by the guards to get here. they say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
not sure.  some sort of vacation.  i'll let you know where i'm going.
that's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, i want to be beautiful.
why, mr. stone, you look so worried. can i be of any service?
he might tell me about julia.  the part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  who wants to be redeemed.
you have insulted my son.
we're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
what is it?  did you forget something?
after their initial investment in the factory, grendel didn't need them.  told them to fuck off. they tried to get these c.d.s together in order to have proof of grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  now's the fun part...
and that would be morals. that would be one's own moral sense of decency.
i would like to ask you something.
we make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  i think we're more alike than you want to admit.
son ... are you awake?
no you can't. it... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf.
it'll grow on you.
do not lecture me about treaty violations. the federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of intergalactic criminals. it is not i who will surrender, it is you.  on the planet below, i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. if you do not surrender immediately, i will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
got a title?
like hell you are!
they're real good.
what about his wife? the woman doctor? have you visited her yet?
i'm telling you, you sounded great. you, uh, you may be surprised.
i'm going to the bank and i'm getting my jewelry too!
when my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
that takes care of this week.  the tenth we got the sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the capri.
you mean he's your brother brother?  you made that up!
no, i need my car --
jesus, look at this. nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. and i'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
how reliable is this kid?
probably. you know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
when are you going to take off that mask?
... and so, and so the doctor says, "if this is the thermometer, then where'd i leave the pen?"  you're not... you don't think that's funny?  george, work with me, i always get a laugh with that one. look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
well, that was a very promising start. by my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. yes? dr. brodsky's pleased with you. now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
one of the plagues on members of congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. get my son into west point--or *outta* west point. i've got a scheme to put people to work. how do i get rid of cockroaches? some woman's composed a hymn to replace the star spangled banner. want to hear it?
we're not going to make the storage room!
i'm not.
how would you know?
is this really your desk?
yeah, most people just whiz on by like i was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
coffee?
i don't wanna talk about it!
yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. he loved that about you.
well you're not reading it right!
i heard that too.
top of this ridge. fort and lake george are downhill of it.
alright.
i'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. but it was pure wishful thinking on her part. the girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
that's from your movie, right? "the only monsters are here."
standing right here in my office.
what're you thinking, jerry?
we'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... i imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
i can see that, alan.
we will.
got it?  good.  do not discuss anything over the telephone.  do not talk to the neighbors.  stay out of your yard.
what?
that's an agent. manager's get fifteen percent.
no!
captain willard?
can i get my parking ticket validated?
more soldiers?
with all due respect, cynthia you're nuts. i'm giving him another month!
the song's 9th and hennepin. i spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/and you spill out/over the side to anyone who'll listen." remember?
none too discreet, is he?
my dirty undies.  laundry, dude. the whites.
you looking' for some company?
arrest them!
did you ever tie him up?
and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and i'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place so we set t-t-traps everywhere. and every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
you're sure it was the hilton?
you're out of your mind, man.
more or less.
exclusive? that's great.
did you like it...? looking down at graham and knowing what you could do...?
to the mine?
where do you hail from?
i love lucy!
cause if you don't know the number, i can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
poor ninotchka. poor, poor ninotchka.
"klaatu barada nikto."
can you save her?
you don't have to eat the carrots.  just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
public enemy!  all i'm trying to do is cheer us up.  go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care.
morgue...?
damned difficult, i'd imagine.
that this was going to be a key party?
rewrites that bob barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
no. i married a midget.
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally. last week you went to a torah study group.
is this what you mean, m'sieu laval?
i'm still here.
thank you, commander.
our child's safety is at stake.
will that be good for you, mr. kay?
come on. i'm not gonna go if you don't come.
if that was your knife, muddy, i wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
what the fuck are we going to do?
what? what?
yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
you're sick of my company?
you talked to walt?
it's all taken care of.  it's all paid for.
take it easy, that's bill.
that's easy to say from over here.
no, just a little too old.
i've even printed my own currency.
dorothy!  dorothy!  we're busy!
is this your homework, larry?
shhhhhh. now i have your disease.
matt?
you see?  we've got the voices.  they're just allover the place. i've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. better than me.  we just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
-- no -- marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
bravo, your majesty!
it's not funny. he permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
eric! are you here?
i won't let you do that. i shot the bastard. and i'm glad.
martel's and coke. one ice cube. in a snifter this time.
that can easily be arranged.
daya deo dono dato.  dalutan!
i'm not sure what you mean.
i guess i'll head back...
and if we pull it, we lose a week... we only have two to the next full moon.
now don't make me feel as if i'm being too forward, ok? if you don't --
we may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
yeah, but what about me and ray? i didn't see our names on that pardon. you said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
yes...
yeah, well --
case... yeah, miami joeboy, quick study. how you doing, kid?
is tong older than ming?
lower the fuckin music--i can't hear nothin.
maybe. do you have a boyfriend?
thank you.
oh, do you like it?  i'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
- along with tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. circulation 27 million. daily. -
this -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
i'm proud of this play. it's so different from anything you've done.
yeah, we promise.
how?
why?
would you sign it for me?
what do you mean you're not a christian?  of course you're a christian, we're all christians...
i told you not to bring the other one.
"over--"  you know - i can maybe understand, since i been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that i can partly blame myself. but what is baffling to me, is how, since i been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
uh... yeah. yeah.
i’m guessing maccallum, 18 years.  neat, with a water-back.
great. later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. right now i kinda have to hurry before i grow a lot of hair and eat people.  say this heart thing works. what's it got to do with adm?
can you get him out of it, eddie?
bert, now listen to me. ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? bert, listen!  it's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
look, mary, the truth is... i'll be in town for a while now but i don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
come here -
get me on the am shows, larry king, cover of the journal...  i've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  make sure they only shoot my right side.
what?  what?  what, jim: i tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
yeah?
crafts.
you did.
see does he want some.
so why didn't you kill me then?
um-hmm. well, that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life. you walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, rose.
where're you going, ichiro?
no, no... don't say that. bad word.
you tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
it's different every time.
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
so am i.
i mean i'm not stealing the fucking car.
how come you know all this shit?
damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. we'll get those new routes to pittsburgh and boston and the equipment we need. we're gonna compete with the big boys now.
it was an accident.
is this about sarah lawrence? you punishing me?
let up on the brake!
then take the pills.
i've been meaning to ask you, mrs... ummmm.
i'm more interested in the story behind the story... how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president.
yeah, julie, i'm sorry.  i just thought...there was an earthquake, i think.  little one, but...
it's simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
i'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  we can't risk it.
of course i know you!  from the first time i saw you, i knew you had a wonderful soul.
we had us a deal here for nineteen- five. you sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, without the sealant, for nineteen-five!
look at this fellow... or this one.
they're awful.  they make me cough.
any luck?
steph.
it's not funny, doug.  you dream about her every night.
i think i'd better go home now please.
sure.  that's great, ray.  i think you should get down there right away and check it out.  let me know what happens.
that's it. we're ready.
what should we get?
he's got it.
i'm gonna need some bread, man. this ain't fair. i'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! you're two months behind on the rent, lieutenant!
it seems to be causing a stir. what's with the toilet paper?
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. your father arranged for your sister's abduction. he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. as a clone.  he had different hopes for you. that you would uncover the truth about the project. that you would stop it. that you would fight the future.
that's what happened. in fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. she'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. she was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. so, she said no. and the guy says, "look, i really love you, and i wanna prove it. so have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, i can never get any of your money, and i'll sign it." so she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. and once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

it's a technique i read about. if you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..

the theatres are all closed by the plague!

he doesn't like it.
you were talking about the promotion --

i still don't speak spanish, michael.
oh, judy!! when he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? what a shame! but he knew he was safe. you couldn't talk. didn't he give you anything?
really?
oh, just leave those things for now.
yes... the beautiful carlotta... the sad carlotta...
maggie!
good morning, mr. parrish.

you.
but it's impossible.
you are drunk.  you know, it's been a long time and i'd love to catch up, but i really got to -
yes, we couldn't stop him.  if you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
no, i don't <u>think</u> so...
i don't want this.  what are they?
you spit on me!
i came after the woman i love.
thank you, admiral.
uh - - thumb!  the same way.
you are repellant when you drink.
jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
what? you don't think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
who told you...?
well... i mean like lula bein' in a family way.
what d'you expect? you come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
hey. you ok?
sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but i'm in the computer room, and i think i've located the malfunction. the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the emergency air lock. can't pinpoint it exactly, but i'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
the police don't know that.  and it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  i'll take you as far as california.  if we can even make that.  after that i'm cutting you loose.
does it?  i don't know.  this can't be just coincidence.  it can't be! can it?
i was expelled!  when i was fifteen?
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner?
...to him. 
i am...
where's timmy and buck?
i would not have had that happen to you. discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
do it.
i didn't count the days.
being in the club means being stirred up by things.  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
hell no!  i'm rolling.  i'm a businessman.  i'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>!  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
this is supposed to be salvation?  what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
aye, sir. on course to ceti alpha. all is well.
if you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
thanks.
you killed my jody?
i'm too messed up to teach.
it doesn't matter.    it'll work out.
well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.

the tide's running.  it'll take us to the light.
don't know that it does.
ho, diplomatist!
what happened?
no, he's the dad.
we were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  what we need is a honeymoon.  let's start right now.

the truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
you got my barley pop?
that’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
so-so.
absolutely.
better her than me.
dr. towler; page 406, 'contraindications to general anesthetic. ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' does that sound familiar?
problem? no problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
people have been asking me about that story in the paper.  i told them you were the first person on the scene.  they were asking me for all the details.
one fight a day with veronica is about all i can stomach, thanks.
uncle, 'tis a shame.
oh, i suppose you would've just let them take over.  these aren't fraternity pranks, john.  it's anarchy.  a revolution!
who was that?
you know, i'm not the marrying type. i like to take my fun and leave it.
oh, captain howdy....
are you sure?
you're gonna let us go?
marty...
don't.  it's horrible.
no reason at all, darlin'.

like you could find one
morning, darling.
that isn't true.
doug...bob mcclane.
and people are actually fooled by that?
a distinct possibility, admiral. the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth's oceans
and as an investment in the future...
he's replaying the game i played against him move by move, using these girls as the chess pieces.  all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  why?
eh, that was a terrible production. renfield was a drunk!
what's that smell?
i mean...with your car.
i'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
bottom line: i don't want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
he left home a long time ago. he was in the hospital, up in los ang gleez, real sick.
i'll tell you what i'll do. i get thirty dollars a week. i'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. i'll do anything you say.
what do you know about them?
excuse me, dawson, can you put me through to mr helpmann's office?
i expect you to look out for me, pup, let me run off work details.
we saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including commander data.
hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
all right, gillis.  you've got five minutes.  what's your story about?
she's on the other side of this wall. i can feel it!
"home cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  he's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  he's probably planning it right now.
how did you know?
nah.
what motel you staying at?
you're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton...
everyone's.  this is a lawsuit.  we need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
a long time.
fuck!
no. i haven't. but i've been out of town.  hello, rex. hello there.
not entirely.
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
ingenious costume.  let me guess ... trust-fund goody-goody?
all we know is there were two women in a green t-bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  we're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  so far, we got nothin'.
times two.
yeah, still got one poking around.
why isn't anyone coming?
all the more reason to go to africa.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
if everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
are you freaking out?
uh, losers!  all losers!
i hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
yeah.  well -- see you, doc. 
sure.
hey man, i was in love once.  i got hurt really bad.  i never wanna go through that again.
ju-just stay away from her. it's none of your business, okay? there are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
you sound very cute, very nice.
didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
you don't know anything about joe --
good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
illegal channels?  shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. lifetime supply of pantyhose, or some shit.
marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with mrs. dudley.  and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney.  he says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
you pack a gun?
you think it'll spoil the boy, eh? was i not assistant to knox?
he's with us...
you don't like punk rockers?
no thanks? what does that mean? means you ate before you came down here? all full. is that it? naw, i don't think so. i think you're too scared to be eatin'. now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. i'm still a mystery to you. but i know exactly where your ass is comin' from. see, if i asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, i'd say to myself, "this motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. who know? maybe he don't. maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my chinese, watch my tv." see? you ain't even sat down yet. on that tv there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. you just been starin' at me. now, i know i'm pretty, but i ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
we were having a little talk.
thank you.  i'm at 639-7393.
i called mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
i heard.  tore your face right off!  bad news.  it obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
would it? she kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
i-i didn't mean to say "whore," diane. i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, claude?
don't do it, evelyn.
i love gifts.  what did you guys get us?
it's a spice rack.
accumulated evil... festering for decades...  but i'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.

mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
this is jennifer and nick. they're dear friends of mine.
excuse me?  <u>you</u> requested our help.  you turned over command --
and i appreciate that so much, i really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across america when they view my latest documentary sensation "indonesia ...hell hole of the world". ernie hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. we're going out through universal ... laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
you take all your dates here. blake?
that bum.  so what if he has a porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's friday night for crissakes.
what was <i>that</i> in aid of?
--darling--
i always liked him. especially last year in munich ...
why is that?
joel? it's joel, right?
lieutenant, you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
what do you mean gone?
what else could it mean to me? it's obviously a lot of bunk.
daniel, just forget argon.  let's get out of here.  we'll find another way to stop the waste.
welcome back.
maybe it's legit.
where's joe?
well, i just want to know the procedure. i don't want to upset your routine. do you want any jam?
a thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit soviet-american tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
have a problem, call ford fairlane.  he won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. let's face it.  after today, the california raisins aren't gonna hire you.
now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
nah.  maybe.
that would adversely impact my income.
huh.
this could be it.
i'm not married.
and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
oh, come on, come on!
why don't you? i'm writing a script and i'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
i was bewitched... it's better this way...
--to become president nixon's campaign manager on march 1, mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
you were hoping for a kind word?! you're my mother! you're supposed to nourish me! support me!
i give them back to the people...  i make you ninotchka the great... duchess of the people!... grand duchess of the people!
where do i charter a boat?
i said you can be too crude sometimes? i don't think i care for it.
kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. now if you'll excuse me, i have some work to do.
can you see light?
my god. how i'd love to see that.
so?
would you like a cup of tea before you go?
after i get outta this, cop...i'm gonna live forever...
what does that even mean?
where's gale?
this game is pretty important to him. he made all-stars in high school, you know.
stay with me tonight.  not because you're being paid to. stay with me because you want to.
does it say anything on the tape?
mike!  are you going out?
willie?!
yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  those ingrates really take a bite.  but seriously, when pops died, you got vomit, crunch, and sutton to help finance a c.d. cleans operation. you got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
no.  i got lucky with the lights.
i wanted it
yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
can't sleep?
this was before her pregnancy?
i'm going to keep an eye on that kringelein fellow. i'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the grand hotel.
look at those eyes.
so you're telling me you were set up ? i knew something was wrong.
i'm serious...
because they've been paid off by bellmoth.
she was there.  she didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
turold's son was to marry her.
again, i don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  but if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which i don't think it is.  and if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  with you it makes sense.
how about the booze?
i don't know. why don't you leave her alone.
sort of.
well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  i want to go home.
oh god, bruce, you were a child. you weren't responsible.
can't do what?
when you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. i think the army has honored its part of that agreement.
take your paws off me!
i think you better leave.
left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
now, just a minute.  you have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why joseph should not give my wife the money which i left for her. i can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
who are you?
you saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
oh, it's not your fault.  it's just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  something goes wrong inside.
that was eleven years ago.
and i thought we were getting on so well.
in heaven, perhaps. it is not a comedy i am writing now. a broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
i've often thought about going back.
that's not cool.
what the hell is this?
to m'sieu laval?
yeah, i know all that.
--so, like i say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  tell walter.
baby, don't lie. i know you went out.
...got to be <u>something</u>.  she gives him the sacred...  and tells him:  this is the traditional harvest offering, given to the man who ties the first sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
you did it, quickdraw. i'm so proud of you. you were like a ninja. did i do my part ok?
i know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
i say we don't want to appear greedy.
sure.
absolutely not.  i am very sorry, but no.
your father had a stroke. he's upstairs with your mom and dr. bennett.
what!
my nerves... are beginning to work again.
imam. we should leave soon. before nightfall but while it's cooler.
but, vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
all right.  no. that's nice.
i *helped* you not to think about wally. you were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. this is how i helped you, right?
it's not one of these?
just some sketches.
not a gift.  a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  a genetic fluke.
sir?
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
than you. yes, i see that. by the way, thank you for this.
women?
mr. appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress. believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
he's going to die.  he won't take his medicine. he eats dairy. he probably still smokes when i'm not around.  i asked him to come live with us. alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... but he didn't want to be any trouble.
you can go...
we can't carry him.
tell me.
...but most of all because...they offend thee, my god...who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
yeah.  sociopaths.  they're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
yes, i am.  there's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  why don't you go down and read some magazines?
i know you're my guests and welcome but i'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
i am afraid not. my regrets, monsieur.
jimmy, what are you doing?
follow me then to plainer ground.  god, i love this!
donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  are you clean?
are you from washington originally?
he's not bad at it.
well that would be even better gossip.
you'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
but, bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side!
in my day, it was simply called the double cross. i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck. in our context, it simply means infiltration of the democrats.
mama! mama! miss boatwright, say she gon' help me find where daddy is!
"no fate."  no fate but what we make.  my father told her this... i mean i made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- never mind.  okay, the whole thing goes "the future is not set.  there is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
what?
this was a selective operations unit, agent levoi. there is classified information pertaining to our national security. you don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. jesus christ --
that's lovely.
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr. taupin.
don't try your powers on me.  try looking into that place where you dare not look. you'll find me there staring back at you!! you bene gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  here i stand.  but... i will never be yours.
hiya carla.
last friday. she left work, and home... i was in tucson over the weekend... i haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
no wonder zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. he's planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family.
because of pms, i get hairy, my nails turn into claws, i eat raw meat, i roam the city hunting for flesh. i've become a werewolf!
not exactly.  it's some lingerie store on the strip.
how do you know?
it'll never work.
so you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
yes?
goodbye.
great.
mixed emotions, buddy: like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati. men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
as i recall, i opposed your enlistment in starfleet... it is possible that judgment was incorrect.  your associates are people of good character.
captain norrington's promotion ceremony.

oh.
that's right.
you've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- now, who can i insult?...  who do we owe money to?...  ambassador trentino!  how about him?
mr. president, we are in a revolutionary situation.  we are under siege -- black panthers, weathermen; the state department under rogers is leaking like a sieve.  and now this insignificant little shit ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
we left them eighty-eights.
i'll drink to that.
hello, mr. burns. yes, she's still here.
your grandfather sure believed in it. worked pretty good... too.
son!
does she know that's why you're using her?
we'd better go before we get thrown out.
and in you, too, lieutenant.
i'm just saying it was cold.  i think she kind of liked me.
unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
no, 79. sorry, this makes me nervous.
in other words, i'm on trial.
all i did was kiss a girl.
do you, mr. leland?
jesus christ...
) i'm sorry ...?
typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why i started building models.
i had to follow her to a store.
yo! jean, this is ramellzee.
wow ... that's pretty good ...

i get my hostage first.  no one's turned loose until i say so.
put your pilot on.
but then the queen looked up and saw gyges concealed in the shadows. and though she said nothing, she shuddered. the next day she sent for gyges and challenged him.  and hearing his story, she said this -
where are they gone? you know where they are?
i was going to fix you breakfast.
she was here, you know, wednesday, and i said, "catherine, my sister..."
okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
lou escobar – he's a lieutenant.
i like them.  i was sick of looking at this room.  i think they add a little life.
hey --
why are you ashamed?
no, that's your fault.  it's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  which means, the most important job.
what are you talking about?
splendid!
we thought you was all broken up about toothpick charlie.
no, this is great.
the other car!
all right, all right, don't mention it.
j.t.'s done everything he can. i married a brave man. augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so j.t. can't even get the law enforced.
the longer the air force hits the iraqis, the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage.
like the look of these?  i made them myself, to set him free.
it was fun while it lasted.
ditto.
how d'you know we're "friends"?
let's get a coffee.
you said <u>three</u>...?
yes.
ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
you're wrong.  just for a moment, i heard, saw, felt-- i became creation.
mickey rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
or i might end up with a broken nose.
i've got some more clothes for you-- i just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
who is this "he"?
i just can't believe you could be so --
when's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
nobody does.
it is true that your parents were poor. they still are. and they would like to know how you are - and where. they haven't heard from you for three years...
creasy.
tell him to pull back!
no -- no, sir.
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr. and mrs. lars, that's l-a-r-s, lars thorwald.
being as close, i'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
miller, come in...
whose footprints?
that's me and my daughter adele. my pride and joy.  charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
who?
nastiness. you're nasty with words. why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? you hated him--and i know why.
you are, you are my only connection to the world!
the people at the restaurant?
here's to you, sir.
william - he asked me to meet him here.
thank you.. i accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
rob!  two years ago you got laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  and then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
that's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  you fellers'll have to figure it out.  you're scientists  all i know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
i've thought about you.
why would i want to go there?
i wouldn't worry too much, commissioner.  it'll pass.  we've had this sort of thing before.
i want to know why you see him. is it a patchett payoff?
i guess so.
there'll be a team of surgeons standing by. we're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. in any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. after that, you'll be in danger of attack.
you're right.  you don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  i just hope you understand you're among good people here.
in the papers. i don't tear out the articles.  i wouldn't want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid. you want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
is that what i said?
the hell i did!
it doesn't matter now.  we've just got to be the first ones there.  get everybody up.  i want them all activated.
here, you try.
buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
whistler!
maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  his birthday's always a big to-do.  the stupid thing is, i didn't even like the first one.
i'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
oh, thelma.  oh, no.
i'm not aware of it. like what?
i'm so hungry i could faint.  i've -- i've gotten your suit all wet.
yeah!  here's a name.  this is somebody's personal tax --
i'd know the difference.
that's when i'll get my confidence back.
i would like to use the bathroom --
no.
well... this.
that's not --
okay, okay. take it easy. don't freak out on me.
no. it's pure bullshit, sweetie. you're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. let's get you a root beer float.
i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
no, i don't want you going on the street.
i know. it's okay.
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
missed 'em dan.  you're aiming high!
i've seen him.
so, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  and if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  that's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
gus, webco, the webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. a little magnesium here, a little zinc there. some railroads here, some farm machinery there. you follow?
you.  like the papers all say.
you look wonderful.
yes i did.
stop it!  goddamnit, i mean it! louise is gonna wonder where i am. let go!
not much luggage.
are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge.  they kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. i've won enough money to do what i've always dreamed.
you answered the door!
the brush-off, huh?
i've come to strike a bargain with you.  i wish to learn the power of changing.
i just picked them up on the way over...
what happened? where's jason?
or rosebud?  how about it, jerry?
are you alright, doc? you look... you look real bad.
now listen, it's hands off billy.  i mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
i'll try.
sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  i'm currently running the store. can i see the cd?
only to see.
new hat?  jill's up, i see.
how was it?
not everyone here agrees with him. i mean, you know, about machines. there was even a big fight about it once.  do you like being a machine?
that's the last. the finish. period. some people can learn. some people can't. and you wonder why we never get serious --
you have a gift, jack. you do. you see people.
yeah, sort of, i guess.  i...i'm sorry i locked you up.  i thought...i thought... i think maybe i am crazy!
heat is not heat! there's different kinds! and this heat is much hotter than what they got in michigan. you go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
well, i'm good, i don't know if i'm best.
johnny does you favors, kid. you got to do a little one for him once in a while.
federal bureau of investigation.
no.  yes, of course i'm mad, because you love me, i know that.
give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
not long at all, but i really like him.  okay, i know he's a little different, tucker, but that's what i like about him. he's a guy. a real guy. he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. and that's okay with me.
okay. all our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. let's keep chilly. think slow. any questions?
i want you to leave her alone.  i don't want you involving her in....
it's fine.
lamar, do you know the reason why john came here to work with you?
let's do it.
yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
i have someone for you to play with junior.
dr. zira! silence that man!
come on, z.
yes, sir. the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
what?
i can take her.
is this a joke?
hi.
yes, i understand – but where do you take them from?
now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
"but" what?
uh, huh huh, this is las vegas?
i can feel my butt getting sore already.
tell me what you need.
so, what were they doin'?  you're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
fine. now, what does he do? he's got to sit down first and write it up. the where, when, why, how--and everything else. that takes time--
then why have i become a man like you?
where did the parasites come from?
hi jody.
come again?
look, i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
get anything?
what happened after that?
you got everything right but the car. my dad didn't get me a bmw.
d'amour --
sweetheart, you're okay.  you're okay.  you're okay.
i just heard. who is he?
you sly bastard. you're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
will he make it out ?
anne...!  i know... i know that to love you is treason against france. but not to love you... is treason against my heart.
i don't understand.
the vortex is collapsing, sir.
i know. i kept walkin', i headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. you let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. you kept askin', 'why'd you come to see me now? why now?' like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
i'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
i am not living with him.  i've just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i'm doing. look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  you know that, don't you?  i left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  and i suddenly realized that i like my job, and i like what my life is could be turning into, and that i'm getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, i sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run.  probably nothing.
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline's husband.
what the fuck?
the intention of registration act -
the kid...
after all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
fine.
oh michael, look...
then let's narrow it down.
people love... comedians.
i like to expand my horizons.
<i>new york times</i>...?
no, you're safe --
where's the victory?
they found us before. the plan didn't work. i don't know what to do now.
i'm not so sure of anything as you are, john book. you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  just as i could live yours!
do you love me?
i love all of them. they're strong, gentle men with families of their own. and if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
okay, baby. okay...
it's a breeze.
what're you doing down here?
what can i tell you?
hell, good luck!
if we're for real?
our friends, my job, eight years together, i suppose all this was implanted too?
twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the captain is.
what is that gizmo?!
we crossed our own tracks.
he is your husband, no?
we are so fucked.
yes.
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this?
we can still sandra bullock it.
hey, lenny.  we made it.
it's late, mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
we're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
well, i'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
watch this.  right between the eyes.
mother of god ...have mercy ...
he --
so you, like, come from a town like this or...?
arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  i need arnold to help me win this war!
death!!
if there was a problem, they could do something right?
i was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
i'm a ghost.  boo.
was it because we went to that party?  you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
would you mind taking a walk with me?
got him!
it's getting too cold even for me, nick.
i don't understand...
lookin' for what's comin'.
what's wrong?
it certainly is.
big sonuvabuck. based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... i'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
big trouble.
figured it out yet?
oh, the whole family loved him. of course, they loved the last guy i went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
called him.  we set an ap...
help what?
what sort of injury did he have?
hi.
bloody.
did you see that?
think for a second. is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
grady tripp. english department.
oh, yeah. that's what i mean. see? it was easy as all that, huh?
universally rejected. strike three.
only blanks.  lemme do it.
i don't know. he just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
how quaint.
yeah. but who's not a slut these days?
what do you mean?
but it's all right, isn't it? you were able to arrange everything?
sorry, diane isn't here at the moment.
and now that wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
sir, that's a field job. it's outside the scope of my assignment. and i've got a test tomorrow on -
well, i left someone very special behind.
you don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
tim's jealous, you know? he wants to have ideas too.
for her majesty.
uh-uh.
what would you do if you weren't an escort?
you shouldn't be running away like this. what's going to happen to the estate?
you don't know a fucking thing about me.  you don't have the slightest fucking clue.
no, let her rest.
what she did not say was, 'i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' all she cared about was that look. all she remembered was that look. and why do we remember things in movies? because we can see them.
i don't know what's going to happen to us logan but --  are you glad you didn't kill him?
no, i love you, really.
the foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  i hope you'll forgive me but i thought you'd...
can't be worse than any of these other fools.
what time is it?
vicki?... this is batman. i thought i'd call and see how you're doing.
you're not doing shit.  you're so scared you can't even think.
is this how?
my pimp.
donde esta? estoy perdido--[where are you? i'm lost--]
they do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...they hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
you shoot like a girl.
how many women has he used, our bill?
if you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
you and al lived together a few months before you got married -- after dad left.
"messed around" messed around?  i know-- i don't want to know.  first base?  second base?  stop me when i'm getting warm...
we've got pressure.
evidence of a massive infection.
grandpierre asked me about an appointment charles had -- on the day he was killed.
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu?
the what?
in the woods you said you had nothing. but you wouldn't, and i wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. please. at least not right away.
i'll send you straight to hell, fuck!
is he really that big a sap?
yes, so do i. but i think he is a little... old-fashioned. like a puff, harold?
ride with me, cousin?
what is it?
so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
objection!  mr. roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
what're you doing?
christ, that's twice in...when did they move in?
right.
a <u>statement</u>?  i wouldn't mind getting a statement.  you see, <u>my</u> client -- the united states government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
look, go ahead...put the radio on...
oh.  very well, then.  would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
a hundred bucks a date.
house 25. number's on the door.
i'm ahead of you...partner.
i was downhearted
joanne?

my wife said i have to cancel the deal.
st-rike!
hi to you, son...
oh. oh god. gale --
i don't know.
naw.

the size of this is... beyond me. testify?
yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
what is your idea of being normal?
no foolin'? will you?
just seemed like the right move... whatcha doing?
i don't understand --
keep stallin'.
oh no.  they're trying to blame you for the accident.  that means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
you've never told anyone who he is?  but you'd have to tell me if i asked you.  tell me.
i dunno. try tranquilizers. once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. i'll bring a bagful. it's just the standard tropical kit. but the trick is to get at them.
...joe.
bring me something simple. i never think about food.
especially not miss kubelik.
i guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
but earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>please</u>, andy.
mr. guild means guests!  oh, there are two more to come.
times gone, fort holland was a fort...now, no longer.  the holland's are a most old family, miss.  they brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and ti-misery.
and you believe it?
i guess you forgot something.
she's been stalking you, peter.
you blame everything on kids.
no.
well, that takes care of the valve. it was probably caused by that electric shock.
we'll die if we stay here!
i mean... gretchen... she won't even let me kiss her. she says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. i just don't get it. i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
yeah.
people now have dignity when frying eggs?
except that there's no bed, is there? and no breakfast either.
i knew.
she is like all the others. she will die in the desert.
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
well, where to begin.  it's complicated...
like what?
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam. we got a rehearsal situation here.
don't hit that boy no more.
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
i'm about to get off the elevator --
that's no way to talk, boy. now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. stirred up a lot of trouble. they're always after you colored boys.
no money in his room there?
hey, great they're back.
the stuff we got last night.
... this is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. i mean, in my dreams you ...
you didn't tell david?
she used to tell me she'd turn me in.  little kid.  ten year old.  "if you're naughty, dad, i'll tell on ya."  she didn't want me sent down again, see. when i was planning some job.  "i'll tell 'em, dad, i promise i will.  here, look, i'm calling the old bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  i can see her, the phone in her hand.  became a sort of joke between us.  only it wasn't a joke.
lisbon?
i don't have it here. at the mille collines. i can get it for you.
uh, ninety days. and now i just have to go once a week. see, i'm rehabilitated.
his bag. you know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. he must've left it inside.
scotch, light on the water.
so tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  what really happened on the german front?  you know the senate's arguing your case...
because i know something you don't know.
he's in it with willis?
i know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
not because you were attracted to him?
i see. and how do you think it reached miami?
_we_ sure are.
they have security cameras.  rooney would see you coming.
shit!  a nursemaid!  my first detail, and i'm a fuckin' slug!  i got a 'choice' at all.
what?
then will you teach me what i need to know.  maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
oh -- now look at him!  this is terrible!
yeah?
bah, for that matter, algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
it surprises me that i'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
and you honestly expect me to believe all this?
what's that for?
so, two days?
fine! don't put yourself out. i'll go to the land of death alone.
what?
huh?
you were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
frida's sheets checked out fine. it was just her own blood. from her... you know.
doctore carlo fanelli, curator of the pallazo capponi, 2 months missing.
fine. we hit this bank.
at least somebody likes this shit.
well, see, i was talking to mr. mcallister about my leg and everything... and how i still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
i could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  you returned this westley to his ship?
i...
who is your user, program?
okay. you know what? watch your fucking language, alright? or i might have to.
too much.
it's gonna be fine.
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
you've never seen "the odd couple?"  this is sick.  "the honeymooners?!"
i figured if you were gonna, then i wouldn't have to.
i might not stay, anyway.
you're all part of satan's army now!
personally, i'd prefer stupidity.
the science of psychiatry.
i'm sorry. i wish... people could apologize for other people.
four years. girl, i'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
commodus must hate you.  free your gladiators and come with us.
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
tell me what it was that gave me away. what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air.
oh, gee thanks.  mmmm, let me see--
here's your keys, harry.
well, i can.  some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  i'm not a silly carhop any more.  maybe you're right about fish. when i was a carhop, i didn't feel much more than a fish would.  but i've been sensitized.  i have ideas now--and solid information.  i know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
for one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, i wish i knew.
have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
he said he worked there --
not against castle dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
couldn't help it. no offense. she's not your wife is she...?
i was hoping we could have a special evening.
my subscription lapsed three years ago...

those things in your hands.
his grace is very angry with you.
talley.
look at it.  look at it!  shot to hell. it's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  i told you to check for damage.
what're you now, a desperado?  put the guns down.
now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, i'll be back in a while.
next i want to see rachel.  put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  keep her calm.  tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
just a minute--your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
anything for art, eh, paul?
but it's possible.
very possibly. come on, say yes. i'll buy you a shirt.
i'm turning off the alarm.  i'm turning off everything.
i think i'll go for a walk.
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.
what does he want?
you can't do this to me!
how'd you know i wouldn't?
yes, mrs. pressman.
well, you must know.  you were brought up libya, yes?
i've gotta...i've gotta...return some videotapes.
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
...you c'n'ave my truck. i'm takin' a shiera.
fuck you. i'll get it myself.
are you ok?

you better watch it.  she might file on you for sexual harassment.
ahem.
how old?
dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
i don't know. 'cause you're cute.
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
yeah, i was phoning your mother.
sam the man.
grifter huh? where have you been on the grift? couldn't been here long 'cause i would have heard of you, skippy.
well, normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  how are the hands...?
you dance splendidly.
our traveler's insurance, you know what i mean?
what's that?
i love you.  i always will.
i've come to apply for membership in brolly --
why rose? why rose, daddy?
now?
but they're using you!
don't tell me— don't tell me!
get yourself a glass.
not on duty, sorry.
if you want... i can take you back to town now.
there's a lot of competition for amusement out there. you gotta adapt to survive.
quit showing off!  we're here on business!
i only came back for you.
yeah.
listen, stupid, could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
what is all this jennifer stuff?
what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if i'm only gettin' bank interest, i'd look for complete security. heck, fdic. i don't see nothin' like that here.
i'm in love. for the first time. it's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
we thought it was an emergency.
can be what?
can i have your name again?
gibarian.
so my little brother's staying here. i'm sleeping with rita.
i'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
in a way, yes.  your fate is inexorably connected to them.
you're <u>happy</u> for me and victor.
you're late.
tell me.
what do we got?
naw. they got some blue dye, though. you think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
so you did meet her?
you're there in thirty minutes or i find you, jerry, and i shoot you, and i shoot your fucking wife, and i shoot all your little fucking children, and i shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. got it?
hey. right. no problem. whatever you say, man. you're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. i'm merely here. but obviously i am. here, that is. i hope i'm not talking too much. i don't usually. i think it's all important though, isn't it?
tell you what - i'll flip you a coin. if you win you can come with me.  if you don't win, you don't come.
he's thirty-five years old.
mr. follett.
james dean, humphrey bogart...
i'm promised to another!
aaaaaaaaaaaa --
that is a separate issue.
gruber...
hannah, i have to borrow some more money.  don't get upset.
i hadn't heard.
i call it like i see it, and what i see is definitely soft.
-- as we will be.
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa.
don't tell me, 'cause i'm not going to tell you what i've got.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
so this is the young man?

don't even ask about your money. your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
yes.

yes, sergeant?
no.
hey, things could be worse. it could've been my money. let me help you out, rookie.
do not swear: although i joy in thee, i have no joy of this contract to-night: it is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; too like the lightning, which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens.' sweet, good night! this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. good night.
oh yes.  we have to agree what's real and what's not. that's what holds us together.
mrs. feur.  she's alive.  i met her. she's really sweet.

she's working as fast as she can, icarus.  it will be ready soon.

oh... how very nice of you to bring that for eugene... did general de beauharnais give it to you?
i think my sarah fancies you, conner.
tom?
i think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
you're talking about complicity.
caesar, you still got the money?
ball games! don't break my heart! i wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the polo grounds. so you got a brother. well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin johnny gets mustard on his face at the polo grounds. if i was you—  — listen, i'm not asking you to do anything, terry. it's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
found him. kent island nailed the call five minutes ago. he's stationary.
not interested.
you ready for this?
feel a little foolish?
we're not horse-trading here, wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
what do the years matter?  i've known you for centuries...
thanks.  want'a bite?  mcdonald's vegiroll.
go inside at once.
my hair is coming out.
something stupid.
look who's back from the dead.
the goddamned bastards.
leave.
the food's fine. sometimes i don't eat.
what?
good luck ... peter ... emma.
you want to get married...?
what, you think i'm kidding?  i guarantee it.  an inch more flank.  boys upstairs get hot.  bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
put that thing back on him, fergus.
your hairline looks like it's receding.
i'm a plastic man!  a plastic man!
insane. nurseries are better than any mother could be.
underground deposit?
please--
i have a surprise for you.
that's what tim said.
do you know why you didn't make it?
that place is already bad luck.
this is our concern, dude.

when'd you get in?
how long you think this'll take?
will that stop the tear?
you just worry about your end, kid.
now release the brake. and slide the stick into first gear.
what? quit hollerin'.
ed, i got the lugosi lookalikes outside.
yeah.
you're not just, like, fucking with me?
what?  not <u>the</u> bible?
i want you to see my room. i want you to see all of it.
i'll play ball with ye. i reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
master bath.
when my money moves, i go with it.
yeah, right.
you gonna go get him?
mr. jurgensen.  did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
there was ninety-one million -
hmm.  so, del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
i know it, i know it.
can we phone them in, paul?
what's your take?
joyce was screwing del.
would you like to sit on my lap?
i'm not insulted.
now you want an argument.
religion?
they're gonna mock our foibles.
for evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore his forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
you know like in "the wonder twins" they share everything.
everything depends on the manchester merger.
hello, may i speak to mitch brenner, please?  yes, i'll wait.
i'm not?
how have things been going?
listen, keep away from me, hear? you come near me again, i snatch you bald-headed!
i don't understand, sir! i don't know what the gentleman--
so where'd you say you was?
marcee, things are changing around here.  you and rod will have my total personal attention.
you mean with the flowers...?
you degenerate pig!
i believe you would have.  another fall, i did seven years at lompoc.  and i don't mean the place next door where some of nixon's people went.
king, king, i got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than hattie mcdaniel. now:
you're not jealous, are you? you have to understand... helen and i had this strange, intense... experience together.
uh, why, why are you doing this?
beaumont livingston.
ol' doris sure goin' to miss you.
he's asleep, right?
don't loose heart... assemble the archers.  have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  shoot the damned things as they fly.
these people will kill him, carla jean. they won't quit.
do you?
it's marvosa -
oh yeah?
i don't.  i just know they were there when i left.  i'm giving you helpful information is all.  you know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
we're leaving in three hours.
why don't i make you some of this new mococoa drink?  all natural.  cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua. no artificial sweeteners--
shoes, if you want to know the truth. shoes are my thing.
caesar, don't.
all the time.
uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
viktor, i'm so happy for us!
you know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. so, come out alive?  i don't know. let us think about that.
oh my god, i thought--
...doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. however. i don't believe i'm *prohibited* from telling you this. i guess i'm not obliged to tell you, either. i don't exactly know.  but if *i* were the man, i'd want to be told.
we're safe!
that ship saved my life a few times.  it's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  what's wrong with her?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese, my friend. do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
what do we do with all these people?
what?
ain't gonna be callin' me boy when i blow your face off.
disturbed. and when your friend crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
we'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
where are we?
rio, alex?  after all they've done to...hey, these tickets are for moscow!
you think maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? why do you think he gave us all this bread? or the number on the pager? we gotta represent him by showing some class. the man's got an operation. how does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
and what happened?
i guess, yeah --  oh shit!!
my mom wasn't a goat?
ah.  a philosopher.
how could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. you'll tell me what you think the person would say. alright?
stop saying things so loud!
oh, nothing much. just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. if you don't want me to run it --
i could have lost my fucking hands.
you never said it was off the record.
no.
what are you doing?    you're going to be late.
you just said there aren't any except on earth of the past.
about what?
don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
what are you doing?
thanks a lot, craig.
well, i got a lot, alright? i don't know how many but... my head hurts.
waiter!
hi, grierson, forgive the war paint.  going on to my regiment/s reunion after.
you know, i was thinkin', maybe we ought to open our own place. that's the real money.  build it up, milk it for all it's worth, then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings.  let's you and me take a walk around town, virge, see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots.
what are you looking for?
i came here before.
thanks.
not on the same floor with valentino!
i'll leave you young things to it.
really?
anything i'd know?
alpha.  got it.  what the hell is attack plan alpha?
tommy?
i know top dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
sean, this is important. and it's above personal rivalry--
but -- are you sure?
please go and tell your master that we have been charged by god with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the holy grail.
but you loved her all the same...
mr. shaw, can you identify this man?
yeah?
--no.
i'm not upset.
here are the keys to the taurus. there's plenty of groceries in the fridge. and i left money on the kitchen table. and don't forget...
what are you doing?
self sufficient...
i always felt i could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
you said i couldn't. you've been good for two weeks...
i came here to see that you stay alive.  the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus, a hero.
goals are important.
i love your smell.
...good...  but what's special in him?
we won, austin.
it takes a gimmick, animal, and i figured us a little gimmick.
i guess we're in for it.
you waved to me in the elevator.
then droppen sie dead!
i'm looking for him.
it's been a good two years, victor... the company's accomplished so much.
well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
town records are coming up now.
sure.
you won't of missed much.
jesus--i dunno.  you know.  what the heck.  who knows?
yeah ...
you want a wip-it?
i'm sorry, okay?  let's not fi...
how is it back there?
the woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
i'm trying to help you here.  there's warsaw, there's this --
i get by.
my job.
why would this ship carry instructions in english?
i thought she was a killer, too. you know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
run it.
sorry, pal.  entrance is for residents and guests only...
it would be interesting to find out.
who said "fuck the machine"?
did you do it that night?
please.  it won't happen again.
see! that proves it! old seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
no.  i think i'm hallucinating.
well i'm a nail technician, and i think we both ought to stick to what we know.
look, it's not your fault, okay? it's me.  it's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
can i ask you a question? if he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? what if he does it again? it happens all the time.
what do you think?
but you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
where are we?
because i found out about her...
no, you can tell me straight.  it's okay.  just, you know, tell me what you think.
oh, mother, mother, please help me. something terrible's happened to me. i don't know what it is. something's happened to everybody. please let me come in. keep me here until i get over it.
that's not how he tells it.
here are her diaper rags.  and this is her milk bladder.  and when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  she likes that.
well, i'm very tempted.  it's such a beautiful yacht.  what's it called?
at my age, i'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
one of yours?
honey, did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii?
in love?  i'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  i'll tell you what i love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
not today.  come on, thea....
the staff and guests! how many?
there's no need...
yes.
tell me. what do you want?
good. i'm doing good. how you doin', frankie?
i'm afraid so, you want her?
that makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  they are coming to see you <u>act</u>. what are you doing this evening...?
third.  what you're going to do with your third.
two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
what are you going to do with me? are you taking me to jail?  you think i will turn into your informant, is that it?
think about it: after you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
hey, your gonna regret this.
i've got a present for you...
i'll take it out of their skulls.
i like your heart and i like your style. you might just do, little. lessen you got to git back to that train job.
i have to think about my future. and what people expect from me.
hokey enough for you?
mister secretary - if they link up with those others near fresno...
and she sent no word down?
yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
so she's married?
i don't understand -- i followed the notes to the letter.
maybe i do.
well, he killed my partner!
nilsen?
have a good time.
well!  what do you want me to do - applaud?
yeah.  i told him i'd be there before five.
do you like him?
excuse me.
that's what i get for getting involved.  look, on pay-day at least show up at tony's place to meet him, ok?  this way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  if you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  i'm not asking i'm telling you!!
hello miss.
that little black line?
can we go now?
yeah. i'm not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?
the cops?
what you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
why were you afraid?
gene.
yes, but i lost him. i really did it quite brilliantly. i'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
admit what?
take my hand. i'll pull you back in.
how'd you guess?
none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
what about it?
what do you mean you've never made a prank call?
i have sectors 1-28.  i think hector has the upper levels.
you said.
way to go, anna.
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
like when?
not a liar. you just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
but yesterday... that actor asked you who i was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... i heard -- you had a microphone... i had headphones.
i might as well be rowan smith - or jones!   you cut me off from every -
i think pregnancy is beautiful.
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? you know what code blue means?
i don't know how!
i'm not surprised. it's got a body count of zero. and no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
you'd think they could at least send a ship. bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this klingon flea trap...
don't please... i'll do what you desire...
it is the time.
i told them you wouldn't want to hide.
cabin fever, hon?
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. for now, that's all you need to know.
please, just listen to me... your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  i'll find her.
i saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
mcteague.
uh, hi, eileen.
no ! don't open any of them ! they're all wrong. just wait.
what i have to say must be said to all concerned.  it is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
now that is a lie!  see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  when you break off your engagement to martha curtis, i'll divorce william!  do you hear?  you get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
he'll play with his rifle, i expect. that will cheer him up.
did i say that?
uh... yeah. yeah. she's real nice.
then good night.
you don't like me?
that obvious, huh?
i bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
i want to come home, of course i do, i'd have to be mad not to want that. it's just that marcus trusts me.
"frank" was my mother's father.
let them talk, mr president. let them talk.
you peeked, didn't you?
nice bit. you're good. with my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. i could be . . . emperor, king! did you see how scared those guys were?
one day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and i'll still be paying for it.
they don't care about all the things we do right. [beat] but they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [beat] that's what they should come here to look for.
oh my! 
so what are you doing going over there? you're not her doctor.
melissa!
don't worry - it's nothing bad. i was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
did you like my friend frankie?
i owe you a big one, hot pants.
what's up?
did you want to play ball with us?
what do you say, toby?,
right.  farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
you got this under control?
do you have coffee?
donny!  please!
we're gonna get married.
i am different, it's just that i just got pissed off...that's all.
but i wasn't.
don't know if i can hold it that long, sam.
closer?  i can try.
there's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i'm up to and all that. i'd like to set the record straight. with your help.
oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
in vietnam! on the goddamn television!
mr. president...
what time's sailor's train get in?
all right... box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
about the same. thanks for asking...damn blender.  okay, i can't stand it anymore, i'm dying to know--did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? you had to have thought about it--a catwoman for a night?
yes.
have patience!
it ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
would you like something? some coffee?
mulder --
a rather large contusion, but i don't feel there is any serious damage. i'd like to keep an eye on him, though - i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
what's that, pal?
but she isn't due for an hour, sir.
so why'd you come to l.a.?
i don't believe this.
under there?
where the hell have you been...?  it's...
you know, talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. you spend too much time up here.
was there blood?
lay it on me.
thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. so i left the bottle out as bait.
hey. stinky. kitchen's closed.  whatcha havin'? six library guards, raw? plus belts and boots? man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
i don't know.  fly casual.
to women. they're all whores. let us not forget what chenowsky said. "the greatest men are the most alone." and without suffering, jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
on the contrary. gravity is foremost on my mind. look, i'm trying to make an ascent here. why don't you go pester dr mccoy for a while?
luke, use the force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
well, i just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. i promise...
no man, he ain't the type.  he don't get enough vitamin e.
out my way in montana we always call a bluff. 
i'll be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
she probably died.
if you have a better idea - now's the time.
well, until now. tend the pin.
janet.
tomorrow.
thanks, curly. call me jake.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
kinnear. cyril kinnear.  kinnear did it.
i don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
probably on their first date, right?
ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
saavik... does dr. marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
what am i supposed to say? 'nice sweater mark'? 'did you buy it at eddie bauer's?'
terry left his passport in curacao. we could hide him...
we're hoping it's only a temporary problem, admiral...
of course, yes.
can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
but the proof? the doll?
i heard what you did.
it's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
dad.
at ease, officers.  i'm peter venkman.  i think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can.
well... what do i know?  i'm a bachelor.  lucy... this is going to be a very special night, i promise you.
sure is a big deal round here... alamo road, alamo street, alamo square, alamo buildin', alamo alamo. they ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. that's the thing 'bout memory? some things you wish you could forget... what's troublin' you, sugar?
nobody really changes at summer camp. they merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  you can't be helped, wichita. i'm not sure you can be punished, either. but let's find out...
dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. we are so very very back.  i re-signed cush. we're set.
yes, ed.
he is...?
i've never seen anything like him!
finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  if you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
but you still have to show him the money at the airport.
that's why you waited for me.
borrowin' or payin' back?
what was that?
were you sent by lord dunois?
a varied list of attractions. and which would you like to see first, dan'l?
'cause you're too little.
money. how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that i don't know.
but of course yours worked.
are you the funniest person i know, or what?
hey there, dan'l! black dan'l!
you want to come splash around.
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
why don't you ask the mosebacke?     brazil. until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  today, they don't exist.
they show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. especially the big one.  we bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  that one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  she's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
i can't man.
in the tar??
my guess is dead.
do you really think we're fooling anyone?
and how would you define your relationship to mrs. rexroth. you know -- you are her...?
tomorrow collect from del rio -- he's late three weeks. how'd you do last night?
i said go around!
i don't know now. you-you wanna go to another movie?  so let's go see the sorrow and the pity.
i'm sorry to keep you.  how can i help?
charley.
juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
i'm sorry. i hated to take your money, but --
hello, mrs. watchit.  you're looking in the pink.
no, i'll get you some tea. wait till you're in naples.  you'll find a girl there.
geronimo.  when you're really in love, you'll jump.  off the top of the empire state.  screaming 'geronimo' the whole way down.
just a minute, joe!
really?
this is good. who did it?
give me a break.  that guy's a wacko...
death.  death. without taste, sound and all around us.  because there is no way for me to save them or myself. this is one giant death trap.
what's there to do at the point? god, lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
ames here.  <u>yessir</u>... 
you don't find that repugnant?
take the luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
a monster. i know, i know.
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that's back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i don't know if they still around, but i don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.
father, a post rider came from charleston.  you have a letter inside.
wait as long as you like.
you rock, max.  you... rock...
you were made for this.
what quaint notions, d'artagnan! but they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
i mean, who runs interdiction on the mexico side?
who were they?
so you won't help me?
satellites.
i know you said you didn't want any calls...
you only made half your quote this year.
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. anatomy! heaven forgive you. you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
basically -- he asked me if i could unring a bell.
mr. gower . . . mr. gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. it's just exactly what i wanted.
load of bullshit.
oh, i'm good.  i'm good.  kind of miss my knees, though.
you don't need me...
if i see you do it again, i'll report it.
no, captain, please.
who cares?!  you hired an actor??
he says he's leaving the island sir.
something's wrong.
miz cooper!
can't you get it, darling?
yes.
just a lucky guess.
joe -
yes i do...
swann?  what are you doing?
that's great! there's the address and message all in one word.
well if anyone's gonna protect malcolm's legacy it better be us.
well, is he?
got a sheaf of federal warrants. being in the territories it's up to our discretion how they're served.  that means we got the cowboys without quarter.  the black flag, brother.  no prisoners, no mercy, amen.
what are you, my mother?
i still don't see what it has to do with the president.
can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
it's okay.
i...
"the angel of flight 104!"  you're telling me you're the a...?
we're on.
if he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
what!
you heard me. a bird in a gilded cage.
buy ya a beer?
i want to address the officers, all the officers.  next friday.  can we arrange it at the mess?
some nuts? some licorice? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
absolutely.  good idea.
jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  you staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
that's the rumor.
um. you're doing all right.
never heard of k-mart?
yes, there are, aren't there.
now i remember. annette harrison. your father's the new headmaster at oakwood.
thanks. i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital.
do you remember the make of the car?
mommy...mommy?
don't let it bother you so, wes.
yes, sir.
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you?!
now, wait a minute -- i wrote you.
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
donovan, royalton and levinson.
a beret.
oh i think he's cute.  how's the marriage part working out?
here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
it really is lovely. it's in the bathroom.
i get my own help.
how much?
what is a turkey shoot.
yes. he called some of the biggest people in town.
certainly not.  i'm a happily married man.
what's wrong with her -- ?
i need you to trust me.
all street mimes should be executed.
i did, honey, but that was last night... let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
yes. i love eve very much.
it's what they do.  it's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  depraved children.
it's on...
you should always look to the back too, kid.
buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, i don't want to talk to you. i'm going out and sweep the patio.
what did he want?
why did he go to see mary rooney?
i told trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
done.
come on, come on, you're a toughie. you can take this.  don't cry.
oooh, very sophisticated. having fun?
it's not suffering anymore.
could be a new dance...  walking the shark.
why do they have you tied up here?
you son thomas and virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
mr. clyde you're twisting things around.  i wasn't masquerading. luke trumbo... luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. i just... happen to look a little bit like him.  that's all.
you know mom, it's okay to have male friends. besides, it's over with me and charlie.
how then?
i'll get right to the point, larry. i'm a puppet now...
--this should take only a minute, mr. dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and i was kind of curious about your check.
i don't know what you're talking about.  what's happened?
i though we went over this.
praise jesus.
i'm...
you mean, leaving his wife? yeah. i'm very happy for you.
i am not comfortable with this.   i'm not a good liar.
would you like a drink?  i was just going to have one.
thirty-five bucks.
you think so?  how do you know?
i don't laugh at you, george.  i like you.  i like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
stay put.
you wouldn't be in the way.  i like having you around.
giving up?
i'm surprised he hasn't left.
what happened...?
chicken salad.
in the sheriff's report, mrs. mercer, it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
me?  well, i was wrapped in seaweed. it itched for a while, but i survived.  beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  then jellyfish?
he was trying to kill you, right!
pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
did they look like psychos? they were fuckin' vampires. psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, i don't care how crazy they are.
you call this a paranoid delusion?!
if he gives you grief, i'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
"every trail that you blaze/makes me..."
you're lucky.  i almost pulled the trigger.
it's oregano.  you got ripped off, pal. what are you gonna do with all this?
i'm going to give her a wedding present.  thought i'd better do it now, before i forget it.  i can drop them on my way to...  that's funny....  where are those bonds?
you're very clever, mr. boone.  you just sit there and let me talk. what a sorry old man, you're thinking.  what a crazy old poof.  why are you here?  what do you want from me?
it's no big deal, whatever i mean, if you want.
i can't see anything in here!
chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
an insolent penny-a-page rogue, marlowe, he said, christopher marlowe--has he been to the house?
--don't concentrate on segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
and what did you do?
what would you guess, ardelia?
we see each other every couple of months.
oh, i see. he was a very sick man. very sick.
i'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  and lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
mr. joshua.  well, i've enjoyed talking with you.
now there's the poet speaking!  close your eyes and think of the picture. describe what you see.  now!
jesus christ lady...
i don't live far from here. you and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
lemalle.  we got a problem. where's mitchell?
okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car --
this is a mistake.  i haven't done anything.
all of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, donald.
how do we know this is the right way?
hurricane kept you up, too?
yeah.  we call him doc sometimes, you know, like in the bugs bunny cartoons.  but how did you know that?
where the hell have you been, junebug?
we ought to kick their asses anyway. even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
no, i'm good.
so have i.
memories of the future are just like any others.  i've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  you won't die of cancer, laurie.  there won't be time for that.
now, let' s see -- this goes -- oh, i wish i were better at puzzles.
no. no. i sent an e-mail to somebody, just now. to tell her how i feel about you.  you know i'm clueless, without you. you know i --
there are only two other people in the flat.
i want someone i know to take me in.
do you miss her?
well he said...  you know in his way... you know what i mean? besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. so, dr. scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. he's laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. you know how he is.
frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  just give us the punch line...
how long have you been in alaska?
i'm coming with you.
but, i...
highliner, please.
where's the adm? where did your uncle put it?
#21. way behind schedule. it's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. they see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
i would love to see you again sometime.
rose is almost as sentimental as mother. if there's one thing i can't stand it's sentimentality. in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. he killed his wife with a black widow spider.
i'm not a kid anymore, i can't be all over the map --
dr. soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
congratulations.
you think he's drunk somewhere?
will you please tell me what you're raving about!
mother's going to help me with the invitations.
you're not. we're level. look at the instruments, we're okay!
then he dies. right now.
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that movie.
make eye contact when you say that.
sure. it's all on the q.t., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
i'm in trouble.
show me the animal, jerry!
you should have put that on last night.
what can i do?
it's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
so why don't you just tell her!
they're dead.  jim's dead.
you see?  never tells me nothin'. ace, what do we got on for next week?
samuel says you killed a lion.
you go and put your things away.
...you mean it?
why did you go to the hospital?
leave my daughter alone.
their bones will turn to ice.  their blood will freeze in my hands.
i don't know what the problem is. plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
when?
we'll lose them if they go in there.
i'm just doing it by the book. analyze then vaporize.  crime's a science.  everything's analyzed.
i know.
let's let your tuchus breathe.
sam! why call when we can go?
did he say a wolf?
shooting at maybe eight feet. i can't use any lights.
thank you, thank you.  you know, susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the king corporation's moorish manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. and it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  so, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. stop.  say hello.  introduce yourself.  because here, there are no strangers, only friends. and family.  right, jack?
david?
like amnesia.
we're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
well, look at this. the three of us back together again.
you could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
i am a princess.  you have no right to order me about.
why? it does.
sir, the deadline is today.
what do you figure to do?
what are you going to do?
this is rodger young, we're going down... repeat, this is rodger young, we're going down...!
and this butterfield guy--
why'd you ask him.
dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
we want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  he can go all the way.
what are you doing?
come on! sausage rolls.
i guess i'm a little paranoid.
but it's my favorite state.
he's waitin' for you in the card room.
high tech. i like the sound of that.
get it.
tell me what, boy?
as in 'resulting in death.'  we pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. you know what i think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
certainly, ben.
you weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, ray. you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit. these regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to the graveyard, to indian country. i need you behind me, ray. not pulling against me.
three times, then two times.
i have a wonderful disposition, i put people right at ease.
...what?
it's so cruel.
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. i spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  but it's not gonna happen this time.  we're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  if you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  and you better take it, cause i can make ya work for us without it.
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
we're going to george.  say 'the joint chiefs are meeting -- we have george weln at the pentagon'.
you shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. i'll take it.
he done a year in japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. four years he been in the field...
okay.  did you bring a condom?
and what do you do when you wake up to that?
it's registered in my mother's name.
would you shut the fuck up! i know what you ordered, i was there!
i've always wanted a watch like that.
there is no fair in turkey, billy. it's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. an italian hippie had a car accident and a turk was killed. so, they threw him in here for six months...
well, at least she's off kane today
rise...and...shine...!
what's the difference?
...ray?
planet 10?
then who did?
donnie darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
it's a character thing, bernie. i mean, you wouldn't do it.  no offense.  me neither.  i mean, a guy like bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  heroic.  you and me, we're not... heroic.  it's not our nature. it don't mean we're bad or nothing. we're just not so inclined.  what about it?
but wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
you must not look to me for help. your brother is no longer my problem. he is now your problem, conway.
hunt has nothing to lose now.  pardon all of them.  nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
you will rescue my wife
turn on the flashlight.
well, no rest for the wicked, henry.
i just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
shit.
her?
i can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. if it's my kid, too, then i've got a responsibility, don't i?
i don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you. incredible. the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
one more day, baby. one more day to christmas.
thank you!  i don't know how you did it but thank you.
that's because i've never been here before.
you love me?
i said, 'next time, phone ahead.'
it was incredible. the light, the crowd, everything.
i notice you're still working with polymers.
yah.
i'm sorry. it's really tough when your parents get older.
why?
why should i be afraid?
people.
now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
you never told me your name.
hey, baby, say hello to felicia.
shut up, will you?  you sure? nobody?
now he's here. he went in mr. grant.
and here is three tree mesa -- and here i go out of the big arroyo --
how did you feel when he died?
what?
let me get the light.
up.
we have to talk.
how'd you know it was me?
stan!
it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  that's what you projected on the bridge.
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same.  why must you complicate what is so simple?
ben -- i want you to give her a call.
mike's out there.
yeah, he's told me. burnfield. we all hear about burnfield.
she soars -
what about the cat?
why didn't you get into bed?
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
what is that to you...?
bud! where you been the last two days?
you're a teacher, eh?  maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, toddy.
gee... that's wonderful, jill.
if it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
your father...
hey frank. you shouldn't be coming over here. my parents really don't want you to.
grandpa samuel reaches. heavy duty medicine.
i don't recall his hat, but i've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by texas rangers.  did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
i'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  did you get id off any of them?
the tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
well, you know where to reach me. the church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
he never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
why not just bring the whole toilet?
dr. thompson...?
i got a hunch, joe buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
i only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
no, thank you. it's my problem, too.
you think he skipped town?
i had class.
the war.
that way.
that's a nice score for a girl.
it's working.
478...
love?
i've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  and i'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  his interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  i'm worried about you. i don't want to lose you.  i know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. the only chance we have to trap him.  so, you can turn internet back on, or i do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
yeah?  and what else?
i can see the shed from here!  we can make it if we run!
okay, so it was jackie brown.
so why didn't you do it?
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the united states senate!
what fight?
ian.  it's guano.
this is a beautiful place.
i'm sorry. i feel as if i know you. i'm john triplette... a friend of del reese... i was at the airport. i just wanted to introduce myself. i'm a great fan of hers. if there's anything you need, just give me a call. i'm at the sheraton south.
do you always have to repeat?
gary blinker's fulla shit!
is she going through with it?
why don't we take oxygen?
there you go again. you're nothing but false notes.
great. that's great.
can you describe the relationship between mr. kramer and his son?
i hate boats.
the beautiful one.
...he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
you like chasing the dragon, walter?
closure? how do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
may i inform you, monsieur, that i am major fidon, official courier to the court of the emperor napoleon, on my way to our embassy at st. petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
what sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  i should say, no sort of boots at all.  aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  is that what he marched here in?
on the bar t... looking for... them.
"lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... do you think anyone's hurt?
not really...  maybe a couple of peacemakers...  i imagine you could overlook those, eh, bill? if you didn't see them... or hear them?
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  i contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
you don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
i know more than i want to know about it. who's the father?
follow him where?
i never said you were "nothing".
khan could be down there!
take it.
then i saw this bakery store that was still open, so i bought a birthday cake.
don't need a lecture. you fucking told maya, didn't you?
you will wait?
me!
listen, angie, i wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. i introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. now, why did you do that?
i tried everything.  something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
her who?
search me! when i come to i was running down thirty-fifth street.
they can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
look, i really don't have that much time...
i sort of like it.
why, is there a new foreign secretary?  who was the old one anyway?
boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  and <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  jesus.
not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  hi.  what'd he say?
i'm just --
this isn't human blood.
then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
who were you talking to?
a herring?  isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
it's what?
mason.
what?
people change...you know.
joe koehler.  i know him.  he's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
yes.
praetor.
now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
jerk... what did you say?
yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
nobody's going to believe it.
where's the candy?
never.  for when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
supposin' you met an elephant?
monescu.
how about something to eat?
los angeles is 100 miles away.
where will you keep them?
when is that?
so, we must face china and all her might alone.
bullshit.
let her go! our only chance is outrunning them!
are you all right, marty?
stop it!
come on, you can trust me. please.
we're gonna be late again.
come on, damn it. don't get so defensive. it could be stuck in your hair, you know.
 move.  this is already affecting our schedule.
after the jack-o-lantern.
she hated sleep.  she used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
chance to get even?
that's why i need your help.  you said you were good.
adam, that's not true!
yeah?
larry, you and your wife got problems?
go.
joe       go to, what the hell does that mean?!!
not far enough. come on.
congratulations.
i told you --
i do <u>not</u> like you.
you need an ambulance.
what do we do?  okay.  fucked-up bowman's turning blue.  doctor.  we need a doctor.
please --
what the hell?
i'll be home soon.
hey, i gotta give the guy credit. he does the most obvious thing. this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  so... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him.
what do my eyes see?
-- but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
creepy.
what are you thinking?
helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. what are we going to do about it?
evening. welcome to phoenix.
was it a sudden quarrel?  had there been any trouble between you before?
i heard him say it.
yes, ma'am!
snoopy.  glenn michaels.
doesn't she look great in that new dress?
dammit, i'm talkin' to you, woman! i gotta farm to think about and i need answers.
the safe. now.
okay. let's catch up. you go first.
i gather you're a decorator.
you've made it ... brighter.
is that why you didn't write anything else?
can you spare it?
not enough, what do you want?
not what -- who.  morpheus.  the greek god of dreams.  look at the next line. "her god has gone and left his home."
yes!
eh --
so? so nobody's going to want to pay for these gatorades.
i always am.
did you work with him, keith?
dinoine chagantakat!
do you?
no one will believe us.
why?
owwww...
yeah, my poor baby. it's his daddy's fault. i mean earl was a good man... i mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
so uh ... maybe we could uh ...
you've kept up your end of the bargain, i'll do the same. but you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
...the night batman was born.  what was i doing in the fields that night, alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember.
english?
neither of us really belongs here.
hey jack, join us.
are you sure?  jack -- this is not something you have to do.
what do you think would be in order?
no. i was just kidding.
i -- i mean it's all right. it doesn't matter.  i'm -- my name is andrews, charlie andrews. i've come from india -- i've read a great deal about you.
uh huh, pleasure.
well i guess you can see, never a dull moment.  maybe you should stay around to see what happens next.  who know?  you might find a future here.
look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  now get dressed...  you’re not wearing that to the thompsons’ party. i don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
i know what you are thinking.  i'm not going to disappear, okay?  i'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  i got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
lyle?!
because you were jealous.  because he cut you out of the will.  because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if rebecca lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
it still doesn't matter if i kiss you?
yeah.
...do we?
he's gonna kill her no matter what. if i take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
are you tapping kissinger?
any luck?
not at all.  they could be carried.
have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
you shouldn't watch, jerry.  it's a moment without hope.
is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded... something remorseless...
<u>oh god it hurts so bad</u>!
you sure?
another couple of good men get burned up for their city? is that how it's going to read?  you're the only one that knows.
the suspects!  they won't come.
mom liked it.
be careful.  sir te requires discretion.  official business is difficult enough.  don't let personal feelings make it worse. and i don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
i'm sorry, i thought you were somebody else.
stay awake!  you want to go hypothermic?
unfinished business.
maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, i need to tidy up -- just a minute, i'll be right back. you'll wait?
depends on where you want to go....
good thinking.
well, i need grass and so do you.
i'm tired, too, frank.  if i ain't around no more, it don't mean i don't care fer ye. i care for ye a good deal. i care for you more than anybody they is. we made friends right off the bat.
oh hell yeah. we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. so don't feel so bad dude.
miss cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little i can help you with.  now if you will excuse me, i have a great deal of work to do.
besides, it's historically inaccurate.
so does it look a lot different?
is it over?
sawyer. guess what today is?
on what evidence?
there's two of 'em, lou!
yeah. russian minister of transportation.
ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. you don't need to be pandering flesh. it's nonsense. it's beneath you.
when did this start?
like what?
eight years, though.  that's quite an accomplishment.
got cash.
i believe you issued an order that all citizens of paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
no way. she had a guy, i'da known, believe me. sewing was her life, she was really great at it. poor freddie.
yes.  it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared.
today.
what?
i can't believe the price of these fleabags.
take it easy, baby.
... death ...
sure, daniel.
listen, hannah, i'm flattered, really, but right now i --
well, is it real? do we know anything about it?
nothing.
just relax, dear. now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
i don't think my sister would agree.
well -- we don't mean to force you, jabez stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
what'd you bit me for!!
you want to know what i think?
you wanted an answer to your question.
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. cyberspace, mr. case... a realm i believe you're familiar with.
i'm sorry.
rodger young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  i'll take the first group.

dr. jones.

what did he do?
the hell you call me?
your phony fbi assholes.
-- then perhaps, the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld.
do you want a beer or not?
i'm a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
what?
impossible.
what the hell did you do?
yes, sir.
what are they peeking at? captain waldowski in the shower?
what sort of problems are you planning exactly?
oh, paul, this is so romantic. ian and windthorne dueling for the right to misery's hand. does ian win? oh, don't me. it's windthorne, right?
marcus aurelius has died.
what am <u>i</u> gonna do?  i'm gonna "fade away."  what are you gonna do?
here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. ring him up, he'll look after you.

...jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? for christ's sake, you were seven years old! you think he could have heard you in there?
the lesabre!
come on, paula! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! or the class before that!
take the first shot at me.
that's the whole works, right up to date.
i'm not using him as an excuse.
yeah, come on, let's talk.

what's your point?
i think he's alive.  i'll tell you about it later.  i'm definitely being followed.
i'm cold. i need to get out into the sunlight.
yes, i'll be there.
he's a low-life.  speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
not exactly.  what you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  but you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
yes, ma'am.
i've been crazy about you for years. i've seen every picture you've ever made six times. i'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
i feel like i do.
what're we going to do?!
was he a relative? or an intimate friend?
hey, isn't that the preacher?
in any case, i don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.

upset!  what's he upset about?
i know.  he loves that thing.
fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
not now.
fuck the details, they're always to blame... look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. i see it at my company all day long! so i'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  one of us should.
a tooth?
i don't believe he did it.
why?
did you see the way those girls drove off?  i did you a favor.
who you gonna call?
mickey?  call the state homicide bureau. don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
i just can't absorb it all. this place, the equipment. what it must have cost.  why all the secrecy? why do you wear the mask?
my friends?
why, because i'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
what business is you in, homer?
what did he look like?
what are you talking about?
mr. treves, some more books arrived for mr. merrick.
have you read the bible, garland?
how can you still believe she's innocent?
jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a flyin' fish?
we got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like rita hayworth at the nite owl.  another dead ex-cop under the house of rita's mother. it's not a good week for ex-cops.

the license!  you get it?!
i was going to be a physician, i am a physician, but i kept drifting over to criminal psych. this seems to be the best of both. my parents still haven't forgiven me.

margarita found them while cleaning your room.
i guess it is. but i personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. that wouldn't be common sense. incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
good work today, ms. woods.
look at them, mr. dickson. they're going crazy.
i thought as a child. but when i became a man i put away childish things...
i ever tell you about the time years ago i was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
no way, mayo. you don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? hey, man, i figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my f-14 and sell it to the cubans.
never mind.
give it up! just give it up.
i'm not a stalker.
to join, and become one with the creator?
they caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. they found the bird. his head crushed in. when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  they think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
because he's wearing moccasins.
now listen, ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. i'm watching the side door and the colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
i've been doing that a lot lately.
i'm not going, john.
you know how important this is to my mother. you know that.
then tell me what to do.
nothing. i'm fine.
i don't care how!  think of a way.  think of something.
no.
we should play some time... i mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
holy shit.
i just went there for a job.
well, go on! go berserk!
he's one of them.

that'll teach me to wear white after labor day.
our transit time is 257 days. is that true?
it's fine!
you weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as i can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
... luke, you must not go.
either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. we got to go one way or another.
you're going to be very disappointed.
listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
no, i'm not kidding.
me? you've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. why me?
what else could it be?
wait, mama, wait. i have something to tell you. i've decided... well... i'm not going to make movies anymore. i thought that's what i wanted, and i went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but i was miserable, mama, and it nearly killed me. so now... now it's over. i want a different kind of life, something... simple. i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and i'll have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... it's going to be okay, mama, i know it. and i love you.
because i think they're after you.
right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.

why, zeke, -- you're just as scared as i am!
it's about that meteor.  they say it's a whopper.  the district officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. thought you might be interested... it's ten or twelve miles from here - over by linda rosa.
... doctor crusher has something that'll take care of that...
are you all right?
charlie?
no, we should leave the poor bastard alone. i get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.

you see what i see, bork?
creasy... wait.
why would i want to sell my passport?
"the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." see i knew you never loved mark.
you've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
you're joking...!
doug...

--no, no you hear me out, sean. this young man is a true prodigy--
were you with another man?
hardware's too sophisticated.  it's gotta be the government.  and why do i think they're looking for you?
oh, yeah...
we are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
no.  i'll tell you sometime.  not now.  don't want to jinx it.  but it could take the edge off that jail time i got coming.
going?
it's awful white of ya to take it like that, everett. i feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. it's been eatin' at my guts.
nice to have you back with us, mr. brubaker.

dr. evil, do you really expect them to pay?
oh lord!
what can we do, mother?
hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  you might learn something.  now i got--

this is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
i'm sorry - i don't seem able to understand anything you say. he's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
what'd you say?
thanks.  lovely view you have, haven't you?

you'll excuse me, gentlemen. your business is politics. mine is running a saloon.
...up!
but what'd she actually do?
i presume the planes are armed?
i don't believe you.
tell me more.

she was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.

rudolf otto werner. wind section since 1936. what instrument did you play?

oh, tracy... i have to tell you, i'm not the one to talk to about this.
...at all.

i know.  how long will you be gone?
carrie.

cabbie drove around all night.  three people got killed.
i don't believe it.

hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back?

sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. when he does, we could beam him out...
women! ever heard of 'em?
it's gonna be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
well, i wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. once we get the baby, god willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
no, carter.  i can't take this.
it's not like that, luv.
yes, i come.
smythe, what do you do with yourself - i mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?

i think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
let's get things straight, bud. i'm not going to take a cut. i worked hard and you can't decorate a room in new york for less than $100,000. curtains alone...
there's only one thing that will stop the martians!  we've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  now there's no choice.  the united nations has voted authority to the united states.  the white house will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
yeah.
what did you say about a pet shop?
sixty...  oh.
i've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. we should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
we need confirmation on the time frame.  location still uncertain. remote witnesses are hooked in...

it's right there on your golf bag.

"nor did they handle axe or knife to take away their victim's life -- no sooner done than in a chest they crammed their lately welcome guest."

i detest serpents.
it was okay?
of course.  i'm a terminator.
he can't drink this milk. it'll make him sick. he's on a formula.  i was a fool! i shouldn't have kept him with me.
you're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
think what you like. but don’t presume to understand.
it smelled of the fire.
i would feel nothing about my life? is that what you want to hear?!
you ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. sweet talk me all you want.  didn't you read the sign? it says...
shit...
are you on the level, father?
you know, you're lucky to be back. most niggers die on the front lines. seems like that's what they're there for.
you don't?
isn't it a little late?
why is he acting so strangely?
heavens, no!  the owners don't like us to even talk about it.  i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
that could break the machine.
faisil.  you're new on harry's team, aren't you?
yeah, well martin is known for his flipping. he flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
have you thought of what you want planted yet?
i'm embarrassed. the list is so long.
okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
hot damn, we gotta find those boys! sign 'em to a big fat contract! hell's bells, mr. lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
i had to go to work!

i don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
you don't...
whitefoot, of course.
what with?
what's the play?
i'm thinking about the duck breast.
talk to me about costs, here.
i'm not sure. my guess is that's what sid wants us to think.
she's innocent, jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
that one.
yes, you've got to get me out of here. i've got to find her.
so what's it like?
and where's he going to be?
elroy.
shit! you bought enough pate for a fucking army!
oh, please.
well,  what seems to be the trouble?
it's your time mister. fifteen minutes ain't long.  that cigarette burns out, your time is up.
boy, i sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
tom prinze, tanked as usual. that's a shocker.
the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we're not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?
it's a single sequence repeated over and over.
you're lying! you were after the evidence. who put you up to this -- the manager?
what?
you told it to me.
what've you got for me?
no, i mean you, right now. not it you were somebody else.
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two.
you? you went by the book?
some people are very shy by nature.
you're picking up my lingo, hon.
nora's not coming.  she refuses to leave her son.
he doesn't give it to us.  we take it.
a committee of the majority party leaders. they decide when a bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
hmm.  where are my kids?
no.  i got a problem.
there is no news big enough.
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one.
so?
just ask me what you want to know.
i can't sleep either, lately.  a little link, between us.  but bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and i'm dying to disturb it.  that could put a strain on our relationship.
'one hundred prayers' could be the page number. the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. but what book?
ever been to club skunk?
...if i don't come back tell mother i love her.
doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, mrs. miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
parrots can do as much, mr. treves. it's all very nice, but i don't see the point. you know they won't let him stay here.
not remotely. because iocane comes from australia, as everyone knows. and australia is entirely peopled with criminals. and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
robert?  i...
you do?
exactly, sir.  that is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
money.
the evidence was very meager --
sir, i was wondering ...
that's two weeks from thursday...
well i hope so.  that pretty much cleaned me out.
how's that football story corning along?
so, what are you doing tonight?
bet you're only eight and a half.
and violence is extra.  and expensive.  so how much weight you looking to move?
please!  please!
but then you knew what he was like all along... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on...
...who sent you?
criminal
she's a bird, willow.
not with the romulans.
ah... no.
i haven't killed any--
i know.  i know how rough life can be. and how unfair.  so here's what we do. tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
how 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  the guy is seriously not well.
and get a doctor.
don't be ridiculous! they're just a bunch of harmless old men. my grandfather was in there.
maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  it was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "stand by your man". i was moved.  you were very good.  i don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
where to?
but father, it's not fair.
willard...
you should hear our ranger band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! good evening, miss saunders. good evening mister mcgann.
you - wait! you didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
should i be ?
all i knew, she was pulling away. it made me crazy.
i don't see that at all ..
--i've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. he just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
here's what i don't get.  for nine months, death does all this shit to make sure i win these tickets and end up on route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
what?
heat, i think. the coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
yeah, but i like the sun.  i grew up on a reservation.  the sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  jake's the same way.  he loves the desert.  i guess we're alike that way.  that's about the only way.
and it can't be forged?
cocaine?  how much?
yes, much too good a time. the place is to be closed.
what?
uh, mare, what kind of dog is puffy?
i beg your pardon!  i turn myself inside out to help you and now i'm a heavy.  here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
don't be coy.  i've always known about your feelings for each other. all these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. you're both wasting precious time.
i have no idea.
but maybe i'm wrong.  maybe you're wrong.  maybe we're both crazy.
i got word from wynant this morning...
i guess part of us never really leaves high school.
i'm glad you do.
you got me.
th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
i mean, i'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater. your girlfriend christine is in there.  she's all alone. everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  i've got my knife.
she's missing. we've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
"vase with twelve sunflowers."
how could he be a fake? 
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- gabriela is relevant.  when i spoke to you before i didn't know she'd been seeing eduard.
have you seen the oasisburg police? they drive golf carts with little red sirens.
what the hell are you doing?
look, snap out of it, will ya?
p-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
hey, ray, you ever been to the cotton club?
you'll have money when you work.
five.  since i've been here.
listen to this.  i have an alibi, i'm going to the como inn, why? why?  the place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  why?  because i probably did it.  are you going to turn me in?  george?  are you going to turn me in?
you're zimmermann's calculator, archie.  all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
...yes?...
too early to tell. nervous?
cases, leads -- they don't matter, rorschach.  the world's about to end.  if someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
i want you to take this... to remember by.
mr. president, i'd like you to meet my dear friend, mr. chauncey gardiner.
what am i going to do?
dylan.  and...  chase.  my god, wes, did you know?
no, not really.
i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.
i told zack about saturday night, too. the fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. come wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
-- and god the angry parent, and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
where is inner space?
yeah.
dewey my god i thought you were dead.
how'd you manage that, then.
well...  i must admit, when my assistant told me you were here i was, really -- i was quite -- i was surprised.
what have the witches always asked of you...?
there!  happy?  i asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  now look what you've done!
the car for debbie?
goddamn it, sean, you listen to me or i will kick your ass, do you hear me?
fuck is that supposed to mean?
in what, a romantic comedy?
you were in the car!
i don't.
she doesn't lie!  you sure you fed her?
you mock my pain!
in some fashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earth's future into earth's past.
but you have never liked jason. you always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
now that's just gross.
uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. call me when you're finished, okay?
sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me.
the other he spoke of is your twin sister.
because i'm not allowed to.  i still do, after work.  so, what?  should we just break up?  is that what you're saying?  because if you are, i'm going to run out of patience.
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  superfund is just one of those words.  people stop paying attention.
i reckon.
... this is another world, tom - i never would have believed it...
you're his keeper. if you don't mind him seeing you, i don't mind. but you're the only one he looks at.
i'm sorry... i'm sorry...
maradona is a cokehead.  hand of god, my ass.  we're wasting our time here.
daughter's.  sweet sixteen.
good night, eve. i hope i see you again soon-
legume? you mean, a vegetable?
what do i want?
it strains me past the compass of my wits.
we have only bits and pieces of information.  what we know for certain is that, at some point in the early twenty-first century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to a.i.
sorry. i was just trying to be nice.
on the contrary.  it has everything to do with the world.  and our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  you enjoyed the girl?
the corner!  ready?
but it's already come true.
and you, sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the rainbow bridge to asgaard?
what's the hold up?
i'll give notice.
well, what do you think?
you disappeared on me. how long you staying?
we did it, ray.
hey look at this, no feet!
i am usin' it, wyatt.  been wonderin' how the hell we got in this tangle.  you know they hit clum's house, too?  shot up his wife. his wife.  who ever heard of that?  men sneakin' around in the dark, back-shootin', scarin' women?  they're bugs, wyatt.  you know all your smart talk about live and let live?  ain't no live and let live with bugs.
what?
i got a call from ross this morning. cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. they found tom grunemann's body buried there. they've notified his wife.
and i love the inscription you wrote to me. only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am.
c'mon, it all worked out. you came out okay in the end...
guy's a spook!
i'm tired.
no -- i'm afraid not.
he's on the telephone.
all right- you'll spend your nights inside.  you'll have plenty of ammunition. you're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
well, don't be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
he had you cut to look like veronica lake?
i gotta believe. out!  now they're rollin'.  king-five-four gets an eight.  pair'a nines with a jack gets a four. ninas still up.
which way?
you said you couldn't kill anybody.
you know, when i first saw you, i thought you were an american.
really?
you're not like my other students, james. so what was the movie you two saw?
swiped your purse!  while he was saving you?  you gotta be kidding!
no, give him a living.  but never let him know the family's business. what else, tom?
i mean this is good dialogue along in here.  it'll play.
where did you go, psycho-boy?
call 911. call 911 right now.
yes. my husband has been very ill. his doctor and nurses are staying with us. those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
baby, this is what we came for. we met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
when?
too deep to anchor out there.
because with your special talents, i'm sure you'll do a better job.
not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us.  just the dentist tomorrow.
you know sid fletcher?
yes, it is very good!
having a problem with your eye there?
oh, you...  ...ennh.
that i'll just...that one day i'll just...disappear.
i didn't want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry.
got any plants?
oh?
hold it...!
can we go up? do you mind?
thanks, king.  i've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
hana?  hana?  are you alright?
disappointed?
are you sure they're home? did you call?
sorry.
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
john, i'm talking to you. this final run through is <u>important</u>. understand? important.
she's there, just like i said she'd be.
bacon, see what we got.
no. why would i be?
god damn it, jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. and then what did they do?  camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
oh, tell the story.
you're part of my flock now, john. welcome.
no, i came here to drink... myself... you know...
you could've hit me.
that's okay -- really it is.
pretty creepy, huh? are you totally disgusted?
yes, monsieur?
gimmie a butt.
don't even bother, x man, i'm not your type.
shut up and drive!
has he been prepped?
how many girls have you slept with?
oh, great.
i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year.
it’s called character. god, you’re predictable.
hope we're not intruding.
barbara <u>zelman</u>?  i don't believe this!
you got the schematics?
wade, it's late. i know you're probably at toby's, but i'm in bed reading. we got different habits.
don't feel like nothing.
is it the sex thing? am i being too pushy?
the cops are comin'!
the song's over!  come on! "you could be swinging on a star."
i'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. i'm gonna--  don't tell me to shut-- it's none of your business.  man, i can talk all i want to.
burned out.  i need a vacation.
you've been so quiet lately, petra, i thought you no longer cared.
longer.
of course not.
who's going to buy me a beer?
this is the one that looked at dana.
you know kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, i'd feel sorry for you.
alright, roach, see you around.
you're absolutely right. and i had to come all the way to a pigeon house in shangri-la to find the only other person in the world who knew it. may i congratulate you?
yes.
...i need to make a phone call.
what's that you say?
settle it yourself.  what have i got a lawyer for?
like hell. you know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
i've been using since i was twelve! you're all so unbelievably stupid.  you didn't give a shit about anything i did until now!
hey, you alright?
i don't care -- he's manipulating it.  that bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
how about you take your position?
give you three minutes.
no -- the rent in paid. the lady asked us to promise, i wouldn't open the door.
why not?
you're going to get in a lot of trouble, mr. taransky.
susie.  it's one more show.  one more time.  that's all.
you're kidding me.
it's done, alright?  it's over!  and there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
we've had some terrible news.  mr. lebowski is in seclusion in the west wing.
how would you know?
this other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
santos... you kill that sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
what, with me on the pillion?  would you kill poor me?
what are you talking about?
fighting’s a part of it, annie.  you know that, right?
one room, one night.
got a couple questions to ask ya.
well, mom, he's the first to admit it.  he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice.
we flopped the first time out.
no! no puede hacer esto--[you can't do that--]
hey... did we uhm, you know....
it's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
don't you think that's a little psycho? a little weird?
how do you know that?
do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
go on mike.
you remember the first time we met finnegan? i think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off sumatra for those two chinese...what did we use to call them?
wait a minute! she's right! kryptonite. i remember reading about it in an interview with him.  nuts...
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, monsieur. i am moved to make one more suggestion, why, i do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit?
hold it! hold it in!
drunk, sir?
it's not funny now. i'm a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make. i'm not a kid anymore. you change.
that's right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
oh, no. it isn't that. i knew i wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
hello, bernie.
i'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  to me.
no!  i got to find him.
so i know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
maybe that's the problem.  i want... a family, ellie.  i want kids.  a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid.  a real life.  maybe that makes me a sellout but i don't care anymore. it's what i want.
he's alright.
why not?
you can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. and tell them where he's going.
ok. that's wrong.
what old mill? is that somewhere we --
well that's what i said.
what about picard?
who is machine?
i have spoken to the klingon high council, sir. they identified the bird of prey as belonging to the duras sisters.
are you finished here, sebastian?
hi.
how?!  it's a machine, alex. machine's don't think.  they're not alive.  it's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
he should pay.
and why, please tell us, would you think that?
the trail of tears.
are you scared?
that's what this is all about?  a shakedown?  you picked the wrong people.  we don't have any money.
there she is!
what happened, major?  some kind of private beef between the two of you?
you needn't take it any further, sir. you've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. i've learned my lesson, sir. i see now what i've never seen before i'm cured, praise bog!
could you play arcade with that?
oh, yeah, yeah.  how old is she now?
grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
okay, now what the hell does this horus guy look like?
are you running a high fever, man? how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? how could you even conceive of it?
you told me you'd say that, too.
would it matter?  and what's that?
i forgot i had it on.
get on the rocks!
c'mon, donny... let's go, man --
so, what do you think?
he's a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.
hell, i'm just like him.
i can imagine.
welcome home.
i don't think i can go on, sir.
mom?
then i have come to the right place.
i thought maybe you'd like dinner.
i mean many of the greatest sailors were.
no!  i'm not going any further! it'll wreck my car.
the duck?
no.
i'm in!
thanks for handling this.
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
talk to me. let's assess.
wouldn't lie to you. and they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. you can eat a lot, can't you?
are you with me... or against me?
yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, mr. lonneman.
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin.
that's what i'm trying to find out, danny. who am i fucking with here?
i know your father's the vulcan ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how i feel about this: they're animals.
oh, johnny, mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we'd take him. do you mind?
good. now you can go for a reason.
we need to talk.  come on.  upstairs.  i am a new person!  i'm completely adjusted.  witness the tux.  it's armani.  who chattered?  goines?  weller?
oh. you mean... today?
who else can i ask around here?
i didn't do that frank. i took particular care not to freeze them.
now i didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
slapped her around a little. punched her in the stomch. it was pretty scary.
but maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
well that's good to know.
it is miraculous.
i'd assumed dr. loomis would be here.  michael myers was his patient.
camelot ...
sure, sure, sure. you go on home and talk about it to your wife.
it's "comptoir sud pacific." makes me feel like a hula girl. which is kinda what i'm going for. wanna come in?
and... what's my name again?
hiya, lou.
the speedometer.  and it was downhill there.
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
excuse me, general bonaparte, but i believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
thought you had a skirt earlier.
i know, i moved the barca-lounger into the corner.  it’s throwin’ everybody off.  what do you think?
sir, i'm a british officer.
like knox taught you? like i taught you? in cellars and graveyards? did knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
you got that right, mikey...  you still believe that, don't you?
where the hell are you?
that's a very stupid question, ross.
meaning--
then you'll have to make your own home. lots of people do.
yes.
everything okay?
i'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  you have not for- gotten madame's new year's party.
let me help you.  betty schaeter, sheldrake's office.
any verification on numbers.
you're a redhead.
<u>don't say his name</u>!  just practice. do it <u>yourself</u>!
yeah, baby.
never mind . . . listen—suppose i should tell you that ellen andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
there it is, good as new.
mom--i mean, dad?
i'm back.
...that's better.  pan it around a bit.
man knows what he likes.
stop it.
february?
oh, jeez.
i still ask, why do they want disarmament?
lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  maybe i should see the ...bodies.
want to buy a bed?
oh, hello, peter.
they're a bitch team... score! roenick!
what's causing that!?
i know steve.  no.
<i>what happened to them?</i>
me too.  for the most part.
thanks. thanks for seeing me, at home.
okay. the woman just can’t walk away...  i want straight answers. no hesitation or i walk for sure. why can’t you go to your embassy?
the details of my life are quite inconsequential.
in nomine patris et filius, et spiritus sancti.
sure.  set me up and then don't tell me.
yes.
bartok ... have you ever been to paris?
could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. all walks of life: george best, for example, had it and lost it, or david bowie, or lou reed -
is there anything else?
but if it got late and i hadn't shown up?
how good's your intelligence?
oh tsht. yes.
only you and the photo lab.
really? what did he say?
i think you'll like this. know much about cuban cigars?
give it up.
breaker. breaker.
no'm.
i think i'll ride along with the lady here. just take a look at this farmland before i come into silverado. see what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  i'll see you around.
so you don't mind?
pity. i was growing fond of mrs. peel. unfortunately --
and after the steak... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall?
it's a bi-partisan issue. everyone needs to swallow hard. no one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
i know. you loved her. so did i. it was an awful shock to me, too. an awful shock. rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon. i thought they was a-doin' wrong. i was about your boy's age. they say i'm well now from it.
yeah, guy?
the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! fifty lashes each!
executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
paula, how far would you go to catch zack?
what are you doing?
listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  something's wrong.
relax.  if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
nobody seems to want to do anything—  why not ask me? perhaps i can offer a suggestion. do what about what?
did you say something?
we should remind viewers that truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
karl, you up?
totally stale.  and the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  we're thinking pavilion.  sitch?
no, thank you.  yes. i've seen every performance.
what about zero, darryl hawkins?
why?
i guess we do.
okay.
what? what the hell're you talking about.
he's dead! eddie, he's dead! it was his heart.
you?
no way! he just called him a dick.
oh hey lloyd, why are you here?
hey, i'm, you know --
colonel tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
yes.
look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
goodnight, honey.
why are you being so hateful to me?  is this because of lloyd?
oh, it's open.
greer?
we're here to say, your government was right.
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
hot chocolate?
i can't do it. i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
where's the stiff?
the fucking rapists, man. the punks who raped that nun. the $50,000 reward from the church! remember?
dad --
well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  so, you kids out there, keep the faith. cause mickey and mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
i called gerta rauss. she says she can represent both of us. they call it "collaborative divorce." it's apparently all the rage right now. and it's easy because we don't have children.
there.
no it hain't, luke. you ain't alone. ever whar you go, i'm with you, and so's john.
but tell me --
what was that?
jake'll take care of me.
alex... people are staring.
i'm a great believer in doing nothing.
what were you gonna do with me?
so now i see where you're coming from.  just because we ain't rapping about gucci, timberland, rolex, benz, cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
yeah?
it isn't over, is it, conner?
it's her.
we don't blame you, leon, but when we came from russia we believed in simplicity...
patrick, we're in the middle of --
i'm cooking you dinner.
-- i want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
--i want you to shut up and listen to me--
will he talk to me?
puttin' in soem late hours, i see.  if you're trying for o.t., you're in the wrong place.
that was two words.
you can't hurt me more than i'm hurt already.
i know, it's very exciting.
that's not enough.
well, yes. i suppose that is what i meant to say.
when was that?
i knew him. he would never -
well, i reckoned, saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
i hope so.  listen, mr. mckenna, about your wife:  if i had known she was married--
no. at least i don't recall.
it was tammy i  that's who it was.
do you have chromium tapes?  the others fog in high-
thanks, walter.
ready?
don't call me fletch. don't look at me. lie back down. we'll talk.
that's because there's nothing to figure out. now will you please pay attention. i'm not through insulting your father.
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced?
that must be him. water taxi.
hello, daniel.
what company?
last i heard you cracked sukura international. i couldn't believe it.
you can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight!
an hour after...!  deak, for heaven's sake!  let's give her a night in new york city.  we'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
why not?
i have to ask you some things... are you taking any prescription drugs?
oh my darling. oh my sweetheart.
why not?
...i'm sorry.
then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
we found him like this --
it's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - the natives.
i need to talk to you for a second.
you don't know how pleased he'll be.
nancy?  would you sit with me awhile?
so how long to pop the floor?
that's good.
sure. how about the beach?
them's the breaks, right?  no war stories for this pup.
i'm sorry.  i was on a roll.  i meant something else.  when do you want to leave?
go then. i can't let you put it in me now but i want you. i like you.
i still think you're a bastard.
joe what abilities...?
this is a rolex, i can't take it.
what have you got there?
it's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
we'll wait until you're ready.
i'm not scared.
ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
listen to what?
insane ... ?
so what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
who? who knew just where to hit us? and <u>why</u>?
ahh. i don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
this is a ghost town.  nothing ever happens.
and?
shouldn't you be in your room, jacob?
just stay away from me, okay?
we know.
i have a confession. when we met...
forgive me for askin', son, and i don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
if your friend is hot to trot...i know a couple of mama bears.  ...or is he married?
bjorn's not. he could have bjorn's place.
and your principles?
why?
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman?
it's not that world. it's your world. it's part of who you are.
mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
you're really nuts. i don't know, you really thought it was good? tell me.
ask me why we're so successful.
you're an original, joe.  a little hard to figure, maybe...
you're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
and he doesn't care about me?
i've got a lock!  there!
no one is, honey. here, listen to this... "if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day, i know they will be friends." now that's beautiful.
clarify that.
coming here?
i don't want to talk about it.  if you really want to know. i lost it. and i'm not sorry i did. that eye was cursed, auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
are you hating this?!  are you!
well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
you're in the wrong business, jack--you're sears-roebuck material!
thomas cole. my name is thomas jefferson cole.
no, sir! you'll flood the whole compartment...!
just shut your gap!
well, aren't you excited?
when i get the scotch, how do i know you won't take off?
guess i owe you some thanks, too, lando.
you get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  please sit down.
i'm leaving it here.  come get it and keep moving.
did we ever really think it was suicide?
i felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
this bloke she was bunked up with.  this terry what'sit.
that's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
gawd, you look awful.
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
no, really...
oh lord, what have we done...?
what's wrong, lou?
no thanks, i'm not thirsty.
okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
let's keep our eyes on the road, deckard.
what tape?
i dive in search of god.  if i go deep enough i'm going to find him.
are you okay?
how come you don't roll on saturday, walter?
can i help you?
i'm going out that way, lady. you can follow me.
who am i?  you're asking me?  you're the big expert for chrissake!  i'm what?  the "scumbag," right?  the sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
we can measure wind.
so...
what's that?
phillippe...?
no.
that's impossible.
this part isn't about the virus, is it?
are you okay?
for twelve francs, seventy-five.
but you're his friend.
ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. who else could have thought of this aquarium?
it's really sad.
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
yeah!  that's what i'm saying!  and it was lying next to him.  and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
you and babe brother are so much alike...
why did you do that??!!
how do you know?
if you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
'to bed'?
that's ed.
no.
none of that's true?
you show claire these sketches?
make it 1000. we got a lot of fishing to do.
so your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
hold on.
i really should change.
who are you trying to please? yourself?  her?  which her, this one or that one.  can you face both?  we are in a situation that is beyond morality.  so: leave with her.  you'll see the transformation.
bullshit.  we've played with each other, pushed each other.  this is different. like you want to prove that you're better than me.  who's that for -- evelyn?
okay. thanks.
you got pug killed! you tried to get me killed! you just lost your get- outta-jail-free --
that's a lie!  they still want me!
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross.
ask sal.
wynant dead?  does dorothy know?
they gave you a pardon, man.  whatdaya want?
you don't know?
i said - i suspect the secretary of war.
you sure it wasn't me?
rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, wladek.
yeah.
oh, i'm in her acting class.
hey! on behalf of burnfield, i present to you the keys to the city.
but... but you knew people at harvard.
what did she say?
well...no, of course not--
how would you describe him?
i'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  i have no more "human" response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot.  it's just how we live now.
what am i going to do now?
yes, mr. kirkeby.  you still owe me for the last two bottles --
thank god.  when we lost contact, i thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  we're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  did you notice anything at all that --
hi.
you and your lucky geese.  you always see geese.
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
you could say something like,  "tell me what the scumbag's name is. maybe we can work something out."
it's okay, paul. it's okay.
i remember it made me sick.
i was just kidding.
now look -- please --
goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
no, i'm sorry, i'm not goin'- i can't... i don't wanna go on after that comedian.
absolutely. the map is very clear.
happens all the time, man.  they're falling out of the skies like flies. government knows all about it... chariots of the gods, man... they practically own south america.  i mean they taught the incas everything they knew...
get on with it then.
which one's which?
well, of course not.  my goodness, what a fuss you're making.  well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
he's betrayed the class.
what isn't wrong? why are you doing this anyway?
frankie, i --
please finish your story.
maybe he'll get tubed.
a job? i've never had a legit job in my life!
no way!
oh, my god.
that was him.
she thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that i might have done something.  she said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "you touched me wrong..." "i know that." some crazy thought in her, in her head...
what if it's not that she's seen something?  what if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
we're just -- observing.
look, co...
oh no, dearest jack... i meant every word.
they came out of my <u>body</u>!
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked, really hooked. but you let him off.
where have they gone?
and cut that out right now.
david, grobleski & davis -  my dear rawlston - 
it's hard to lose ...
well, i'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
it's a start.
she met some friend of aunt millie's who works for a record company.  he thinks she's got a great voice.
you think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  i'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
what's the matter with you?
pool.
what happened to those disks i gave you, have you still got them?
well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  i can't do unauthorized work. i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they gonna blame then?  they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
tell her to bring it back!
a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties, marcel. i think you're referring to the pink panther.
...about--
look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
i didn't do anything wrong.
okay, we'll split up.  you go to every romantic place you guys have, i'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
you're going to stay here...?
it feels good because: if you do as god does, enough times, you become as god is: powerful...
i want to ride my own bike.
god may have given it, but claude banks spotted it and nurtured it.
but where'd you go, toto?!!
what took you so long?
oh, jesus, please... please, god.
no.
trip??
do you mean that?
or in dreams either. i repressed it completely. classic pattern of inhibition.
news said two persons killed.
ed tom, i'll be polite.
this isn't a game.
come off it, jack! of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
you know what he did when i called him?  he laughed.  he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  said it was a good lesson for me.  not to try to fill his shoes.
what'd you tell him?
well, isn't it?
they're playing our song.  dare i ask for this dance?
told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something.
mottled really.   green and red.
so what did he say?
the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units. in what way is the life form in your vessel different?
i know. it gets cold so fast.
what is the matter?
are you getting this on tape?
he's all yours. and i'm not your partner.
but.
and we know which lebowski you are, lebowski.
i wanna hear about it.
i'd love to have a dog. but i go to school full time. it wouldn't be fair to the dog.
so, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
now, mister gi...
all right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then smokey and the bandit three is the movie you must rent.
where are you now?
they wouldn't let me in so i had to get you out.
yes indeed.  you almost got yourself killed last night.
you'll never make it.  you've out- smarted yourself.
i'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
almost.
nothing like that will happen between us.
well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
i think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
it's horrible. terrence was one of the most brilliant men i've known.
the hard part ...
easy ted, we're not mining gold.
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. to keep her here with nothing to do - i'd be standing in her way... and you need her, max.
who are you?
fine.  ) grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
unknown.  but, it looks like all of them.  over at the processing station...sublevel 'c' under the south tower.
just hold on!
don babytalk him man. cocksucker fell asleep. they walked right up on us, he don do shit.
the police will not know that. they will want to investigate.
what about your shoulder?
i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
fort powell.  what do we tell 'em?
tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
oh, lord....
best in mexico.
no thanks, diz.
she didn't do anything. she took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'k.c.'  'kathy costello...'
i know you... do i not?
nooo.  i just thought...  l mean, i am looking for a new car.  but i just thought, well, i'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, i don't know, i just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. real friends.  and then things would be different.  don't you think?
no, there's no problem, dr. helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
thanks.
it's okay.  these are police.  <u>what</u> do you want?
that's it...
is that supposed to comfort me?
... were you going somewhere?
i'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
i think i'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
undercover.
you came out of the hospital. you were tied down and hallucinating. you got some bad chemicals in your head, noel. there's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
were you scared?  tell me honestly.
you know, i think i... ordered some just the other day.
i don't think so.
may i offer you some tea, herr mozart?
we ran out without my shoes and the floor.  i gotta get my stuff.  what about our savings?
honest to goodness, i hate you.
right. a clean deduction from observed facts. they've got to be simple once in a while, inspector.
...still, i must say. i haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. don't you find it so, barton? ain't writin' peace?
ah, you get hold of your friends?
he got killed at a turkey shoot.
who?
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs. wheeler.
i mean, you broke up with me, right?
i'm a ballplayer.  if anyone knows what that means it should be you.
it's the car she drove in "eternity forever".
we haven't talked since high school.
they both have some growing up to do.  but they're good people, they're starting with love. they've got time.
looking to get out.
do you mind joining the israelites?
bourbon, little water, thank you.
what's that, sir?
it is, after all, sera, my money.
you just called me a fuckin' nut.
of course there weren't. 'cause they disappeared.  and yet the commission found you, dean.
not enough against their shields.
unknown!  what do you mean?
probably a touch of what's going around.
i know.
any word back from the e.r.s?
i don't mind a parasite. i object to a cut-rate one.
i don't understand, it's your home?
you have to believe to have faith.
look at that.  a white rolls royce. that's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
that should buy you ten minutes at least.
you were good.
the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! you fucked us!
will the senator yield for a question?
well i... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
thank you.  elisabeth, i didn't mean to...
gray has no need to threaten. you remember the trial?
any cannon?
mister ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
you're hitting on me?
no.
i don't know yet.  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
meet a nice girl and have children. i promise the next time we talk i'll have it all sorted out.
i guess that's right. have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
say it!
this stuff really works? no shit?
curse?
no...
no, but many consider my training valuable.
commander? are you still there?
dick, if you're ready to do it now, i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen, while i continue on with jack.
to get on the...
tell doucet that.  what was his rehabilitation training?
okay. i've uh, got some questions, from sue. that she thought might be better coming from me... can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
no, i never read the speeches before i make them. i get more of a kick out of it that way.
forty-nine point four.
i should have told him.
that's the same guy who did this painting.
i hope that it's nothing serious.
no sir he is not.  i read about you in the paper.
you'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
come in, mr. juarez. i'd stand, but, well, you know.
is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
oh shut up.  all we did was talk. my attack had nothing to do with him.
what did you do?
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
wha... ?
my name is father seamus.  i'm from holy rood church.
barnes got it in for you, don't he?
what are you doing?
stand still, miss jenny!
listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. isn't that enough?
they took a left at the next light!
your father will never let you.
you know you can come under the blanket.
you don't know?
i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
maybe because you're shot in the leg.
i felt he did not like me.
i took your husband's buick...  i'll return it tomorrow.
leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he isn't inferior. he's the smartest kid at school !
birds?
how does she know?
genesis was perfectly named: the creation of life not death. it was the klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
so are you really friends with andy? he seems like such a weirdo.
if we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
not too sweet! you make it too sweet they don't eat it.
and take a little trip with them...
sixty.
i mean i've got a job for you.
you and he are not doing things?
hindenburg...
why --
no, no.  that won't do.
women?  no... not really.
what about us?
spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
no, you demand results. they are not the same thing. and if you want results, you will let me do my job as i see fit. unless of course,  you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
how ingenious! tell me about them.
all these in the last year?
the medical bill are 61 thousand now. i've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
not a chance, my dear fellow. the ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. kill the criminal reflex that's all. full implementation in a year's time. punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
uh, uh, this is great.  i mean, i love e.e. cummings, but i can't let you get this.
this is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
okay, let me start from the top.  a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine. now, after the shit blew up last night...
what makes you so sure?
you're going to miss the train.
don't even go there. what's up?
okay, let's hear it. i'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
that will be all, major.  i'll wait for lord cornwallis.
don't act so -- crazy.
they're distracting us?
that's a lie!
great...
come on.  what are you going to do with yourself out there?
instant rice...?
hey -- do you mind?
friend of gruner. just went along for the party.
what do you mean?
good, flatish land with reliable water, why? i don't have money. what are you about?
i love you.  most beautiful woman in the world.
what?
okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.
right. we have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. you know what that makes us? their partners.
two thousand, two hundred florins is all i need a hundred? fifty?
your fear of him was real.  that's all the ghost anyone needs.
you should be happy, holmes. i'm giving you and vanessa the gift of life. sweet, screaming, pooping life! and you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
one idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
what'd he say?
hello, i'm calling from...
she gone like they say?
cream rinse?
yes?
<u>no</u>.  look.  he's got nothing left.
the oldest one.  he was in an argument. a lousy ten-dollar card game. the kid pulls out a gun. it goes off. the kid gets killed. the grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. she has a heart attack.  she drops dead right on the spot. now jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
well, mrs. hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. but not many people walk away from double pneumonia, madam, not many.
get over here.
no, they didn't.
oh -- no. i'm just sort of disturbed about things.
you have the most architectural skull.  and your nose.  very expressive.
you don't have to, now.
i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
jimmy?
unh... unh man... i don't take no money from friends that need help. fuck no. what do you think i am a bum?
oh, god... !
a while, i guess.
take it or leave it. there's 200 men coming from the south that'll be glad to get it.
your legs don't look broke.
why in hell would john do that? why in hell would any of them do that?  after all you've done, it's unbelievable!
on this ward?
the business is changing, rat. i'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to aerosmith.
how's dee?
he no longer roars or spits. he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
i'll try anyway, sir.
ah, i'd sell that. start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
sounds good.
. mommy's here.
no, he's not. you are.
it's against my better judgment...
find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
but i guess we haven't really met -- have we?
he got my gun!  motherfucker was filming the whole time!
yes, well... okay, right. i'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
say, isn't that dr. barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
he thinks he is. he says his mother was apache, but i suspect he's lying.
okay.
yes, i see it! i see it!
yes.
martin.
quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
there's only one thing -- i haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby.  i don't suppose we could take him with us?
and what do you recognize, names or faces?
so?
you mean just leave the hotel?
oh, don't do this!
yes?
my letter of transit? i could use a trip. but it doesn't make any difference about our bet. you still owe me ten thousand francs.
it's the only one with dishes on the roof. the studio's a front. that's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
this one's going to be even more fun.
and?
why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
and did you?
yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
i did... jason, i swear, i did... i told them... i told them i believed you...
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes. it's like a public service.  it doesn't mean much in the end. they're all going to die.
jeffrey--
my pleasure.
i had you transferred to kigali.
no, i just heard the commotion, and when i got there i guess it was gone.
i don't.  no exactly.
yes.  what's your name?
one of the two men was hubley, right?  what about the other one? did you know him?
yah.
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
no.  it hadn't.
they're on the roof.
where does one man get all this junk?
you might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. i may have to shoot it.
hmmm ... well, i guess we will have to turn back.
ain't no big thang.  it's just a po' man's free base.  here, check it out.
we're never deeply angry, we just get sore. the way you do. we know you too well...
i'm acting on orders form the federation council.
do you know the... soccer stadium?
so i took his truck, yeah.
isn't that david graham? he's cute.
just look at it!
oh, nothing, it's fine. i just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
it's over, i'm telling you...
ta da! pantyhose! the death of the garter belt! of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. what do you think?
my bike!  she's a lesbian, too. she told me.
man, you won't like that back seat.
so far these things have not become hostile. for the moment let's assume they won't.  connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
to an artistic eye, you understand. have you ever modeled?
m'sieu laval, there are several things i've wanted to ask you for quite a while. i understand you are from marseilles.
parents say he - uh - fell -
poor little grusinskaya! does it do you good to cry? are you afraid? shall i go?
if the next guy's a redneck.
no.
i'll call you.
quincy, word has it you might make the jump the nba.
i've already solved it.  i've hired a hit man.
never mind.
i was never stiffer in my life.
mustn't do that, sir.
juno macguff called while you were out running. she wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday.
our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe jim trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
with repeated exposure to toxic levels -- god, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
yeah, you do that huckleberry. i'll still be here.
there's only room on that pod for seven.  that's you and the others.  i'm counting on you to get them out of there.
you better have that looked at.
i do her hair, yeah.
you want me to wear white for you? you must be madder than i thought...
sure i'll speak to your class. but i'm a hard man on women. you want to know why?
we had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
ever get an answer?
i know.  i'm sorry.  work.
this is a setback.
you call me with the target's route, i follow along until we've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road.
i don't know his name ...  i saw the whole story.  a wounded bird was on his roof.  i could hear its cries from here. he went straight to it.  i couldn't've. i'd be frozen between pity and fear. but he wasn't.  its pain spoke directly to him.  he picked it up.  nursed it. fed it.  and it got better.  everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  everyday the pigeon would watch him. i saw him learn. learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. and one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  didn't look back.  but he heard the sound of its wings.
who found him?
?!
doctors that are people can't cure everything.
i'm loyal to things that make me happy.
he murdered eladio cruz. that tough enough for you?
no.
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
seventy-one
it's nick! i know that guy. i know him!
wow! look at all these creeps!
it's divine!
what is it?  did you just barge in here... he doesn't have plan.  it's all a whim.  'rob a bank!  what not?'
i don't mean braze.
based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
what do you want?
`cause you know i can do other stuff. i mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
you should come to rehearsals.  i know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
you're wasting your time, frost. far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
you got that big retarded girl down there?
do we now?
you've all sworn to longshanks.
by the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
lloyd.  lloyd dobler, i've got you.
you are a private investigator?
yes.  i am.
how's school?
mr. powers, my job is to acclimate you to the nineties. you know, a lot's changed since 1967.
what are you drinking?
i'm almost done, sir. you'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
she's in back.
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting. your sister, mary, is a murderess. she killed irving august -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
just give yourself a little pep talk. "must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
i am not going to look at any more pictures.  they're like a disease. they get into my head.  i can't get them out.
what's the worst?
oh, it's even more wonderful then.
no thank you.
nobody, i tell you. jake stop it.
yeah? what about laura --
a million dollars is a lot a damn money! and there they are, they got my daughter!
yes it does.
i'll concede in the morning.
i'm sorry, honey. but the birds will still be there next week.
are you ready to go?
we're not finished yet --
felt promising. it's a start.
long's you git me back for the beans...
please. and you're sweating him? you're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
i know.  i went down to the barrett house.  but she's gone.  they drove her and the kids to north tahoe airport.
you are.
what?
i think so. can you catch a plane?
how do you know?
really?!  well good for you.
full of beans, ain't you?  but you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
yeah, that's right.  you wanna come in and shake it for me?
this is your bachelor party. you haven't had sex with anyone yet.
sit down. sure i couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
joe zack is a good prospect -- exciting boy.
y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
twombley's shot. i heard that. not jack. he's okay, i assume.
how many, would you say?
i think so.  they're on location in arizona, shooting a western. i'm free every evening, every week- end.  if you want, we could work at your place.
a ticket home,
you're that guy, the private eye.
the man and the woman are married --
i don't believe in fighting.
how much?
safe house is empty...  air support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  gina?
our recon flight ?
turn right on timonioum road. hurry, dad!
well, what you might try is --
i'm not even going to dignify that --
oh hi.  it's william thacker.  we, ahm i work in a bookshop.
you have a man near it?
no more kids yelling, 'your old man's a thieving rapist'?
we're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. count it out the back. i don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
as it happens.  i didn't make that part up.
i've suggested it myself. but i hate to even think such a thing.  she needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. we all go a little mad sometimes. haven't you?
come on, eve. let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
boy, i thought you were about to cross the river.
naomi.
and what will i live on? my oil wells in texas?
well, then, why don't we go dancing? i know a little road-house, down the coast -
for christmas. your share.  it's just a taste.
what can i do for you?
it's hard to go places, isn't it?
can i use the car tonight?
you merciless bastard!
how long is what?
this, i don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
help him!! promise me you'll help him!
i'm not just selling the script. i'm selling me.  demille always said i was his greatest star.
hello?
i'm trying, david.
he's dead sheila.
you shouldn't think about things like that.  it'll just make you crazy.
a home --
what are you talking about?
you're not going in there -- !
if they are?
feel that?
what?
they're all heavily armed.
rowan...?
follow me! we're going to have to jump over the rail!
shut up, alice. little bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
listen, i gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  why don't you drop me off at the ren cen, we'll hook up later?
sorry.
would you like some brandy?
i don't know. it's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
no. i mean work work.
don't talk about what you don't know. besides, she's too young for "the changes."
i guess i kind of lost sight of things. "may the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  love, george.
lost. it feels lost. this was hers?
it's not just sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  whatever sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
you realize that sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? elective plastic surgery, every single one --
i always knew that.
it don't look right.
he's never forgotten a promise to me.  i'm worried about him.  i know something's happened to him.
plain or roasted?  alex, i'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
listen up, huh? even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
...do not accept charity.  we are two young, able-bodied americans.  we do not want a handout.  we want a hand-up. give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, i will sit back down.  if not, have a nice day, ma'am.
if i stayed, i wouldn't be starting!
ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  not even a detail?   you must try.
does it make you happy?
two sides?  you're dr. jeckle and mr. jackass.
just try it.
that music is for everyone, mister mcmurphy.
later. let's go...
what's wrong?
what are you reading?
so...you...survived the blast, did you?
did you find the knife, sergeant?
who are you?
let me know when you do, all right?
are you planning on working tomorrow?
heading true north.  we continue in that direction.
call me.
he's given it to us.
i’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
steve, dear, please forget all of this.  what can it matter after tomorrow?
what'd you see?
i don't know... he's a little disgusting... although some women go for that.
oh shit.
sure you do.
there's your answer. he's smart.
you turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
yeah, man.
just them?
thief, i think, is more accurate.
doesn't sounds like him.
adam canfield. wonderful. do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? i don't even know who i'm talking to any more.
want me to drive you home later?
bad news, you crazy? you have no world view, wladek, that's your trouble. the news couldn't be better. the moment hitler invaded russia, i knew we'd be all right. remember napoleon. same business. the germans will freeze to death, please god.
there was a young man over at jamilla's today when it got hit. way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
who are you?!
you guys wanna hear a joke i heard?
i wouldn't go that far.
what's the matter? does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
i ain't got nothing but them books.
i am the princess of wales.
so we've been meeting with banks all day. it's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
doom.
i swear i'm innocent.  i swear on the head of my children, i'm innocent.  mike, don't do this to me, please mike, don't do this to me!
even so, i could never think of going on -- i've got to find some other profession.
what the hell was that?
looks like a damn graveyard round here.
i let him go... believe me.
that's exactly what i said! i mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
this is all my fault.
tiny's home.
will you give this letter to michael.
mattoon, illinois. but i moved down south to work in the civil rights movement.

thank you.  seventy-six, eighty--
that's my son! my son is dead!
well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
red dragon.
<u>ow</u>.  shit.
lo?
so how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
applejack drove.
i didn't have a chance to thank you.
she married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the home shopping network...
there's two reasons a man rejects help.  either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
i might have an idea...
i, uh, think i remember the number.
hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i don't know.  how long has it been, jack?
stop him, alex. you've got to stop him.
i know, father.
i never should have listened to you.
shit, i ain't doing nothing. white bread asks for cocaine, i take his money. shit... you know... it was just a hustle.
ulla, i'd like you to meet my partner and associate, mr. leo bloom.
nothing. i'm fine.
it's okay. i won't bite. you've seen pictures of me, right?
martins.
is mom ever coming back?
why should i trust you?
is it possible?
so you're just the thing we need.
the powwow safe where you steal your money! where you cheat your indians!
god, you're getting huge. how many months has it been now?
or looked so beautiful...
it's almost lunchtime. are you hungry!?
you can send me the address too.
rick, marriage will be good for you. it's done wonders for me.
m'hm.
sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
wow.  thank you.
what is it exactly you want, sayer?
don't tell him you're here.
yes. it's a bad place. weird people. strange things go on.
did you check out the dragon mouth?
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
you're looking for life?
i'm placing your daughter under arrest.
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. he could do a lot better if you ask me.
but i don't want it straightened out.
it's me.
what do you do?
-- his life?
no...
why not ?
a little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>forget</u> it.
i mean, the way they look.  their hair and clothing...
why don't you just shove it up your ass!  haw-haw!
i thought i...you..
you're pete sothow's nephew, huh? hell, i thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' i done in the old days.
what was?
hear him?
does he have people?
you can call me gloria too.  gloria -- what a beautiful name.  when i was born my mother named me gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
...screw you, yoyo.
how about these buns?
the pool game is over when fats says it's over.
mmm.
what is it?
where?
day jobs, yeah.  i've tried them.  turn right.
buck is a deal.
did i scare you?
you need a partner for this job. you'll never find one as good as me.
sure. he's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
what else have you forgot?
an honor, gentlemen.  in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
yeah, everything's under control.
goodness, no!
oh, man --
what kind of appreciation are we talking about?
oh, ok.
we can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
barney? why should i? never! we have nothing in common. hmmpf, barney! what effrontery!
so, um, what's your interest in kate libby, eh? academic? purely sexual?
ugnh.
cherry bail bonds.
you'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a christmas gift.
i will once i get past the bulkhead.  good luck.
lord, how my head aches! what a head have i! o, my back! other' other side,--o, my back.
the united nations are still here.
how did you find me?
where?  everywhere, major.  everywhere.
then i shall come too.
--you know how fuckin' easy this is to me? this is a joke!  and i'm sorry you can't do this. i really am. 'cause if you could i wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
that <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  nightcap?
throwers don't worry about ticking. modern bombs don't tick.
well, i mean, you know, i talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  it's nothing against you, tracy. you're the best.  i just thought --
wait.
it's far too dangerous.  zordon would never allow it.
good.
bainbridge books.
where are you going?
as much as we care for him, deanna... we have to remember that data isn't capable of disappointment.
well, tell, him.
well, you practically did! making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down. and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed. if you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. but not you!
what do you want me to do, put out an a.p.b. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
yeah?
just a man. a knight in the king's service.
any survivors?
no! bond!
damn straight.
it's gonna be a long summer.
chauncey, there you are. what are you doing on that leg?
you took that money from julia's hand.
wait, wait... what are my orders if we find this thing?
it does matter. we're in love.
whom have i been harboring in my house?  who are you, sirrah?
... eight, seven...
no. are you crazy?
sorry.
it should be... it's yours.  i want our debt forgiven.  i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states.  and i want the principle witness against my husband, eduardo ruiz, killed.
what's wrong?
just get some people out of our house.
steady... steady... all right, mr. scott.
...you know and all that.
i don't know...
no. no, ma'am.
god damn you!!
) what?
and like, don't take this the wrong way...i mean, i'm cool...but...you know...i've got a good reputation at school and, well...i really don't want it ruined.
data, this isn't the time.
he's not paying you one cent!
i didn't.  until i was dispatched to clean up one of the flight 180 survivors.
okay, just calm down. he could hurt us, brother. he could ruin the whole thing.
you don't want to go home, do you?
really?  was the third act too intense?
i think we might.
i see, do as i say, not as i do.
will you take some advice?  if you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
you're a pimp?
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me.
kat a fan, too?
what does he do--of an athletic nature?
he's as big as toscanini, maybe even bigger. in this neck of the woods, he's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one.
stop it.
pornos.
wait...
take it easy!  i didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
you did it! you made it. i'm a painter, too.
that’s right. and auto supply...
that mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
help me here...
but i had a little help. surgical transporter. i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
you don't want the police any more than i do.
yeah, so i hear. don't you think you should go get changed?
you have?  will you come in a minute, miss saunders.
when you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
that's right, sir, i recall it. a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
i'm declining this case.  i want us reassigned.
the empty shells are crushed and trampled.  the young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
upham?
she's tough.
no more, robert... no more needles...
the song.  are you sincere with me, fredo?
yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
and you respect him.
at some level, i don't understand your nervousness. have you decided to leave john?
wait a minute, wait a minute.  we can still handle this.  can we still handle this?
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
we wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
no, no no!!  it'll be okay.  stay with us!
it used to be serious -- at least i was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
i don't understand what's going on.
well?
then i'll live for both of us, lila. i'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. for both of us.
oh. what's wrong now?
mr. loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. mary is missing.
yes sir.
hello, michael.  i've got something for you...not much...but...
say what?
john.  it's good to see you.
it has no purpose.  it's just beautiful... does everything have a purpose where you come from?
ah, alex boy, awake at last, yes? i met your mother on the way to work, yes? she gave me the key. she said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
we're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
she says juliet's in a terrible state . . .
... remember, counterfeiting is the feds.  they'll be all over abolofia's place.  stick tight. you i.d. the other plate, he does real time.
of course i forgive you.  i know what you feel for danny is real.  and your choice is your choice.
let's not say anything to my mother about this, mr. carpenter.
he may be.
who was it?
i don't know what i'm doing. i know he only likes me as a friend. he's just so...everything--i know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and i used to be a camp counselor...
well?
what does it mean?    i...i mean we, you have other tactics...
here now, what are you fixin' to do?
you can't treat me like this.  i'm not a child!
i'm afraid so, brad.  but wasn't it nice?
goddamn! how long have we had this fucking dog?!  two years, he still doesn't come!  we need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
hello there. how’s the flat. i cleaned...
what for?
well... i have to take this over to debi.
what?
ok. goodbye. now get back to school.
don't tell me --
see -- she's just having some water. now there's no need for the cops or anything.
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
come clean with us, frank. were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
i've been with him since i got out of school. he brought me into the cmdf, over five years ago.
your old man thinks i did it, don't he?
hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  did you see any sugar in here?  any candy bars, anything sweet?
in there.
kick a buck.
call me from new york before you leave??
he's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
if it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
yeah. look at this polar bear. it hasn't moved in half an hour. and those eskimos over there...i'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
town ain't got no courthouse.
i wouldn't be a waitress. they're nasty and full of crap.
are you enjoying yourself?
basements creep me out.
your move.  okay, vaughn, you drive.
sure, i guess.
you could have stopped him.
how can you help us?
and who in god's name do you think you are....?
whatcha doin'?
thanks
when are you gonna come clean with your folks?
that happens, you'll get it back.
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
i thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
yeah, if it opens the door.
isn't he a little moody?
maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break.
how many?
he found out his partner, tan, had been working for the triads all along.  before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
look, you can't buy what i know. ya can't. i've seen it all! i got pain an' i got experience.
there could be problems with something like that mister wallace. what if...?
the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
do you want something else, honey? we order something else?
nancy...
nothing ... it's nothing.  just ... i'm reminded of a song i learned as a child.  a song about pirates.
they come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
where did you get this ring?
fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. you know this little tid bit, dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. what the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, i don't know. goddam!!! this is the suavest guy i know. look at you. you're one beautiful fucker, ben. i love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. i can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
it's not the place. i don't buy that.  trapped in the same town forever. the price she would pay for her teenage lust.
i say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
oh! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! what have you got for me? is it finished?
the house is in flames, benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
you got me.
where are you going?
perfect way to tie up a... 'knotty' problem?
we feel great, don't we? just <great>?!
you keep them.
i think what you did...
mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
very well. climb up.
did he speak?
what do you mean?
spencer is okay. you'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. if you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  you ought to get mr. udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
yes, mcp.
...t-thank you.
joey?
helen -- why don't you and mary go on with clay?
but you know what i'm talking about, don't you?  about glenn, don't you, and the second car?
i have to go back.
oh, thanks.
paltrow, sterling, furey, and the big alabama are in from new orleans. fiskin and the boone kid from denver, and phillips, barnett and limehouse chappie from new york. those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
you resented the fact that she told you what to do in mr. marsh's house?
say it again.
that's all?
what did she say?
you can't testify.
what difference will it make?
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you?
she was good in bed, though.
pete, i want to talk to you!
here, are you always this sarky?
where are we? this is a weird neighborhood...
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
yeah, weird. but great.
but what about your theory? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it.
stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
see, that's what i'm saying. it has the logic of a dream.
let's make a deal.  <u>other</u> than my blood, what can i off--
you tell maggie.
with a little checking, i could get to believe you.
you're late.
is he alone?
jesus.  you done this before?
ought to be. that's fact'ry liquor. cost me a buck.
what do you think of that piece of scenery, yankee boy?
i see where palantine got the nomination.
i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
damn it, edmunds?
hey!...i feel something. it's moving!  he's alive!
i had a witness disappear on me.
-- jesus --
the best business decision if you ever made i'll bet.
we haven't fired -
how about lunch? are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
i wrote sixty-three songs this year.  they're all about joe, and i'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
made up your mind yet?
they want to replace me! the board of trustees wants to *replace* me!
god, you need help.
dinner in ten minutes.
b.o.c.a.
take a break for a minute, okay?
hey.
yeah. who is she?
hey, that's great, henry! good thinking!
pritchett, is that you?
did you?
why it's just a snip of calico...
then you gotta hide it somewhere. somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
i don't know about that.  oh, no, i just, see, i-i've been very, very lucky.  w-when i had the kids, i decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and i've been very, very happy  but...i've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
let me talk to him.
maybe that is his boat.
i'm going to get it for him.  whoever the mole is, i think goes by the name of job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the noc list, he'll find me.
it's gonna be like that, huh? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. why's that?
call the police. okay, that's one option.
don't step in the horse manure.
you're looking fine, major.
i hope you enjoy these cigars. i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them.
do you always listen to what your mother says?  selina. something you choose your life. sometimes your life chooses you.  save the day..
what is it rita?
...look at that. twin cities.  ids building, the big glass one.  tallest skyscraper in the midwest.  after the sears, uh, chicago...  you never been to minneapolis?
i don't want this. yuri, please. i really don't want this. you know i don't like to do groups.
i found it... it's just not there.
benjamin -- i haven't even said i'll marry you yet.
i'm with dana barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  let’s go wake josh, see if he wants to walk her.
uh-huh. well, dinner comes in on trays. we're executives. and we light into this. it is dawn. your bill is ready. you go over there and introduce it--
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
what do you remember?
hey if you're not doing anything i'd like to buy you a beer after work. be just like old times.
no such thing, old buddy. it's a one way ticket. once we cross that border, we're on our own.
i've lived all over the world.
my god! the fork! the fork!
we have no use for your kind.
i am not.
it's me, you dork.
because...he wanted to them to be punished.
what about the girl?  brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  is that a coincidence?
hey, there you are.
it's me.  "sugar bumps."
but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question: have you ever been in venice?
you miss the good ol' days.  even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  those good ol' days?
it's for your own safety.  now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes?
it's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, delly.
no!!! no!!!
and that is?
i don't mind now anyway. you know, up here in heaven, it's beautiful. way better than fuckin' hawaii or any place like that.
we are interested in this case. have you arrested the girl?
yeah? first door on the right. it ain't that dirty.  just kinda' filthy is all.
return of the jedi.
sam, tony, come in here.
yah, so we're all set.
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. like some?
barnard thomas here.  miss vivian, i wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  there's someone here to see you.
what do <u>you</u> use it for?
what's wrong?
what do you think it is?
i don't trust him.
thanks.
all right, stupid question. but don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
so you do eat pussy!
) but thea -- she stands in your way. i know you. i know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
oh, ha, ha, ha.
how long have i been out?
i don't understand.
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum.
i used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it.  i'd just as soon not have one anyway. i hate those damn things.
no... you don't think...?
i'm not the guy, harry.
i'm glad. seriously... i'm very glad.
huh?
you're right, don't matter where they come from.
fine.  we'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  by the way, how're you fixed for spys?
he's leaving the country.  and i don't give a shit.
explanation, mr. decker: why was my phaser order countermanded?
but war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
forget it? i chop wood for the stove five times a day. every time i remember. i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes. and bathrooms. inside.
there's other things to be learned.
i see. well then let's introduce ourselves, i'm damien karras.
“la collectionoose”. it’s about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. it’s on tv tonight and as i’m in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... the review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. and witty. the director’s supposed to be famous. rommel or something. french. you must know him?
do it.  if that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  have enough guts to do it.
you want me to leave?
oh my god, mother!
please. dario argento is the ultimate master of horror.
how'd you know i wouldn't be in the same room with her?
seems like a nice place.
amy! amy, open the door!
you're serious?
how much did you part with?
cover me!
that's right.
why would i lie?
donnie, i'm afraid i can't continue this conversation. i could lose my job.

aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  so...
tell him we're busy.
ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
what's the big deal?  a shark got overman, and we got the shark.
are you sure she wasn't there?  maybe she was just hiding from you.
i'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
can all of you work?
its powers are strong.
sir, i'd like to ask you a few--
what forces do you have at your disposal?
you want to see mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. we're up to our ears in them.
they died well.  otherwise, they didn't do much right.  but if we have war, the british will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
nice of him.

nilsen.
conway's gone again! run out! listen to this! from gainsford.

don't swear at me because we got problems.  i'm just giving you the news.  i went to a catholic school; i'll tell you what they teach.  on the knuckles they teach.
i'm not leaving.
no, you give me a break! i never left a source hung out to dry, ever. abandoned. not 'til right fucking now! when i came on this job, i came with my word intact. i'm gonna leave with my word intact. fuck the rules of the game! hell, you're supposed to know me, mike. what the hell did you expect? you expect me to lie down? back off? what, get over it?
it's a ninety-one!  it's an 'a'!
my mom taught me when i was little.  did you ever hear of the dream master?
i...what?  are you, are you, that's why...?  are you nuts?  i'm...i'm going to close for you, i'm going to...  here, here, i'm going to make this office...i'm going to be back there number one...hey, hey, hey!  this is only the beginning...list...list... listen. listen.  just one moment. list...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  twenty percent. i'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  twenty percent.  for as long as i am with the firm.  fifty percent.  you're going to be my partner.  fifty percent.  of all my sales.

zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
your money may have been well invested, my friend. something important may come of all this.
get the car.  i'll be leaving in ten minutes.  where's calo?
oh, my god.
so, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. that's going on previous experiences.
she know?
we got to stop them right here.
four hundred! do you want to bankrupt this administration?
listen, he just needs to sleep it off. someone will take care of him.
we need an exit!
look, sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  let him take a few teeth...
small town, small bank, big money.
they barely talk anymore.
jurek? wladek szpilman.
every day for the last six years i've thought about only two things. the first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. if i would even recognize him if i saw him on the street.  the second was what i would do to the man who took him.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
melville, huh?  it's been a while.
in hiding.  he sent liddy to talk to me.
no, jack, no, it's not... she likes me.
i'm a what?
it's okay. it's a cop hangout.

you could have killed us both!!
yes, sir.
who's the other woman?
tell us about him.
come on.
have they found our friend?
you don't know what you're fucking with here.
so? ...suppose betty found out about them?
not bad.  now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. every single one.  now in our case, we know the rich white man is steven reign.
who?...  wait a minute! i'm no agent, secret or otherwise. and..i'm alone.
beautiful, beautiful.  work with me, baby. just have fun with it.  okay, he's playing it cool.  let's finish up and get out of here.

that's a big trunk. it fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
oh, jesus!! hellboy -- ?? is real --
-- we need a fail-safe. bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
it's twenty after one.
we're going to tell them what we've found. what we've learned. turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
you watch that mouth.
you want to leave? but stu - you're a big hit! everyone loves you!
in case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
where's the women, man? we gotta have women.
it's your roll--
it's cool... but,i don't know... i went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, i didn't feel anything... i even tried ikebana, ...   and john's using hair products... i don't know who i—.
go ahead and laugh, you know what i mean. what a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. they got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
it was you...
nifty, huh?  goodnight sweet prince, parting is . . . inevitable  now, destroy superman.
that's right.  they called us the "three musketeers."
you heard my -- you havin' fun with me?

who places her trust in thee, my god.
a twist ending if you will.
kronos, sir?
i have an excellent teacher.  'make sure you wear the uniform'?
what?
good for you, hank.
really.
from the smartness of your dress, i take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
it's alright, i guess. you hear from anyone made it out of b.a. alive ?
what is your name?
i'm just saying i think if we met under different circumstances...
time to play spam in the can.
you didn't.
everything coposetic, lieutenant ?
it ain't your locker no more.
she's dancing with me.
why don't you talk to levi off the record for a second?
it's better than real. it's synthetic flesh. synthetic blood. synthetic organs...  it's a physiological machine.
almost got me in billings. i saw you there, shooting at me.
we probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
now wait a minute, wait a minute...
you know how long it took the "chronicle" to get that staff together?  twenty years.
we're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
well, bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against chimera.
nobody's got clean kids.
clay bertrand, willie?
i've got everything.  the bombs.  the army.  i've got marla.
...and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. to kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
jack...can we afford all this?
take it easy, now. don't want you in over your head.
whaddo we do?
oh, thomas, her lips! the early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
this is it. this is where i live. i suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
nine thirty
i know who you are, inspector lee.
what was that all about?
no last name?
what kind of personal project?
that's not what happened to your parents.
he's fragile, man!  he's very fragile!
so where is it?
whatever that norwegian dog was... it... it was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... this for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... we got to it before it had time to finish or...
they're all nudes, if i'm not mistaken.
mr. levene...?
man this is heavy!
yes, i lived. how awkward for you.
this jimmy's?
tell her, tell her...i had to go to fiji. i'll call her when i get there.

what i've always wanted, to teach you.
it's just a nightmare.
tom?
see you around.
but she was seeing someone else on the side.
you don't trust me.
whenever i compliment simone, you take the credit.
insurance? a love affair? pure unadulterated hatred? believe me, the da will come up with plenty of reasons.
he comes up here with our product. he suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. he never shows up. meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. me, i just wanna know what happened to my focking money.

i don't know what to say to allah.
six or eight.  and they go wild?
ready, major.
i, i tried to go back for him, to save him, but i couldn't get to him in time. the fire... have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? it's like a liquid, it slides over everything. it was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. and then he was gone.  i never told anyone until now. but this ship knew, dj. it knows about the goliath, it knows about corrick. it knows our secrets. it knows what we're afraid of.  and now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
german.
that depends.
paul, what's your favorite fruit?
should we talk to trini about paying these guys?  or maybe chotiner?
well, do you?
is there something about the house?
she can't hurt you any more.

'you will anderson?
couldn't make much of it myself.
ramona! ramona!
somewhere else.  i've never been anywhere else.  just once.  years ago.  went to the state fair.  it was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
i am raymond.     thank you for allowing us to stay here.
nihilists!  jesus.
dorota!
fences are failing, all over the park!  a few minor systems, he said!

it's kind of you to see me.
double-strength!

target practice again! one of these days they're going to hit us.
actually, i'm waiting for someone.
no jewelry! hands off jewelry! if we're broke--all right. i might pick up a million-franc necklace. but in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
the most wonderful thing happened -
you think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
i was sure we'd met, weren't you, ted? this is herbert greenleaf's boy.
uh, i have a plane to catch to cleveland...  can i get my winnings?
oh nice save.
uh father, i know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
think this about money still, ya old fool?
i say i've got it.
you need id in there?
everybody loves lisa. everybody loves lisa. but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
you'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help.
okay.  talk some more.
which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
yes, gentlemen. saturday after next, i lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
around here.  yeah.
a month.
that's the shape my hand's gonna be when i hold that thing. you understand? i'm not leaving here without it.
i'm not certain, mister president.  but i believe it was four.
i'm afraid it's not very frightening.  they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as i understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
what with taxes coming up - and since i'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, i've been thinking...
knock-knock.
"terminate with extreme prejudice."
well, something's wrong.
the morning after pearl harbor, he drove down to st. louis to reenlist.  he was so damn excited. world war ii was going to be his second chance.  they told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
yep. right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. the bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  this gun gets fired before ten o'clock. whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. i'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. that's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
yes, i considered it.
valet?  you jest of course.  i am a u.s. marshal.
what kind of tent?
last night.  you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
annie. annie hayworth.
well i don't want to come on too strong. a guy hates a girl to come on strong. fragile egos and all of that.
i really wanted you to call me, and i thought you were never going to --
he did more work on the car.  he wants fifty bucks extra for it.
contracts? -- yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
shrimp and fries.
come here. 
you sure?
don't worry about me.  i can take it.
she said she did.
may we stay here for a while? we'd like to rest.
i don't understand it, lieutenant. it's not getting anything from 4th brigade... not even their transponder.
get out of here.
yeah, well, we're not.
johnny, my dad's home today.
i saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a koala-fish mutant bird. crazy shit.
...i'm sorry.
you got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
looks like someone forgot a camera.
heather? wha...
for two years, i've been tracking the mayflowers' peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces.  their sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
i don't want to go to the hotel terminus.
what?
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
...i can't beat him.
look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. you've done that a dozen times.
i wrote. not every week...
dead gaiijin's are big news.
you stop right there. you are a good person. good things happen to good people.
there's a few things you don't know about women, brother malcolm. they're possessive and vain.
i thought you might know her. she was seen here about a week ago. her name is jacqueline gibson.
you know where to look for your austrian, right?
the british army, sir!
i will go. but not you.
oh, no...it's a combat carl.
there was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan. but he was a revolutionary.
i told you not to try anything smart!  i guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  and that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
yeah.  some clown at schrafft's 57th street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
uh unh.  no way!  they'd crucify me.
i guess i'm startin' to feel a little better.
i feel weird asking him.
you mean not enough to save you.
what what are you doing here?
you haven't got any money.
just let it go, i've got you!
that's not what i asked... why do you want to marry me?
that's great, now make a left, then straight!
as i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
yes.
i don't need one.
not bad. you?
i can't be nice to a fan?
i said, the northwest valley.
hey, take it easy. i know how you feel.
how come?
no way phil.  not like this.
you said nazi low-riders...?
stay where you are.
it's a thing she does.  she talks at night.
you are so fucked up.
congratulations, colonel. you have saved us all.
why would they want us to rob the mafia?
all you got to do is name it.
like joey? are you afraid to mention his name?
i know what a hologram is, captain. the question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
no.
we have to call the ambulance.
of course.
a guy shows you a gun, burnham, and you insult him?  hey, who's the idiot?  huh?
private kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
no.
very good, brian. -- about your report here. the way to a torch's heart is through his tools. that's how you know him. it's the way he talks to the fire. and to you if you listen.
you're so beautiful.
still worried?
how come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores?
what about your mommy?
your door was unlocked.
ryuji and gruner.
will you wait until the chump is played?
no.  have you had any experience with that?
do you understand that you have sinned? gravely.
well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. i don't want to ruin your willpower.
no will, i'm not kiddin' you. if i had gone to see that game i'd be in here talkin' abouta girl i saw at a bar twenty years ago. and how i always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. i don't regret the eighteen years we were married. i don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. i don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. and i sure as hell don't regret missing that damn game.
more nerve than the doctor, i must admit.  he hasn't been home for two days.  has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
that's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  when do you think you'll need me for real work?
a hundred grams.
yeah, i was waiting for that suggestion.
in europe.
hello, don.
i've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  this man hadn't been dead an hour.  he wasn't killed last night.  he was killed today. in broad daylight.  that's no drunk- rolling job.
he had a few birds.  i got up and fed 'em this morning.
but we have. she's wanted for nothing.
great. hey. i've got a bit of a problem. i know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
ed --
fine with me. just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr.
it's not him.  it's <u>them</u>.  i can't live like this.
oh. what about?
be good to your mother, darlin'. she needs you.
don't blame yourself, i didn't have to come along.
trust me. i'm bypassing regular channels. see what kind of payday we're looking at.
huh.. .hello?

what do you mean?
zerelda? little zee mimms?
no.
that sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever i measured one. one of us has got to escape. i'll get the boys. hold on son, i'll be back for you.
didn't you hear me, grandpa? or you got your hearing aid turned down?
did i interrupt something, gentlemen?
mister funboy.
hello, brad.
you're not from around here, are you? where you from?
we made the date three months ago.
just so you know, i think they recalled these cars in 1974.
no.
oh, that's fun.
uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
admiral, i've been hoping to see you. maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that...
i'm still the king!
they need the money for my band uniform at school.
yeah, sure. look what happened to them.
didn't think so. so, as i was saying, i'm willing to make a deal. you behave, get us into mexico, and don't try to escape. i'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
keller, black lion squadron. i knew him at pensacola. he's damn good.
it's all over, paul.
what?  what did you say?
come on in. you wanna ginseng cooler?
liza sutton is dead.

i never hurt them. never.
sid.
what am i doing here?
sir, you can't just--
i love it.
please...
i love you.  how many more times do i have to say it?
what's that?
yes?
er, yes ...
all right, we'll call it a draw.
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
always?
you need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
my father's.
okay, let's go over it again. you met a girl, you fell in love...
uh, mr. president... i don't believe that's on your agenda today.
at least i can explain that, mary. your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. i helped her get that room.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
it was just a year, give or take a few days.  i mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  we had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  that spark, you know what i mean?  you gotta have that.
he's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i've worked with.
honest, lula. i prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. hit was bloody-like around that towel. hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
i know you.
no, thank you'. i won't get into that battle.
that i'm used to.
now that you mention it...
my god! is she dead?
lets see, it was before he moved to l.a... four years april.
you cannot. i'm still editor of this sheet.
have you looked outside?  jellyfish. everywhere.  i hate jellyfish.  harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
ba-ll!
no.
i had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
i was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...i'll take a kiss.
not really. you're not my client. freedom of association. big issue with the first amendment fans. want to go to hawaii for the weekend?
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. whom do you think i should believe?
who had to put a gun to your head?
that's what it says.
yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
shit!
tanks...coming back. let's go.
i'd kill it.
may god forgive you...!  you must tell them!  you must tell your men!
excellent!
why didn't you tell me?
wow. that's good. lots of capers, huh?
sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  see-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* marriot...
... uh... we seem to be all out of ethel merman.
animals that -- that eat straw?
how 'bout yourself?
it's not much money, but it's enough to live on. you'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
because --
shoulda' felt up tammy in the pool, that time...
i was getting to it.
the marriage!
i'm sorry.  i'm not strong enough.
drive in.
did you pick it up from the street?
ellen.
you set?  sarge nods.
no really, let us help.  we're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
oh, come on, amado--
what's that mean?
i don't know why i associate with you, mr. barnard - or mr. chalmers bryant - or mr. embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
you worried about me, too? the chief's worried about me. solis is worried about me. maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
is alyssa home?
today has ben a good day.  which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
ms. burton. you're black.
are you out of your mind?
may i walk with you a ways?
if it worked.
one thing bothers me...  that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  serious amounts.  he's lucky he lived.  so i gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
hello?
we really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, bert?
there's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
i called my folks, then colonel doolittle.  the colonel sent a man to pick me up.  they wanted to debrief me. i told the colonel i needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  i've done a lot of talking.  you haven't said anything.
this cool the heat off you any?
it's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  hello, post... mr. walter burns, please.
anything?
well this is the last time i ever rent here...
who turned off the internet computer...
you bastard! god! i should've known. you wanted the cure all for yourself!
nobody noticed. don't worry about it. we'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
nothing.
when did you get back?
you're kidding me.
would you please calm down.  tell me what happened.
north korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system.  extraction team has to be small and silent -- i'd go with seals over delta force. problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  where's the polk?
go?
you're on earth now, kid. gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. we'll stop by k-mart. get you some warm clothes.
capades? they don't do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
lt. fisk said...
i really don't think it's a good idea.
i mean yes, i help people that need it...
that's right mike. but he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, he's in woodstock now.
just coolin'.
gurney... i see thufir hawat among the captives.  let him stand free.
does that mean we can't...
sure.  in between all the other things i have to do.
i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....
what "magic" have you brought, erik?
jesus, man, can you change the station?
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
so?
but you like him.
telly is at steven's. there's a bunch of people over there. come on dance.
come up and see me... now.
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
i'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows.
the name will live forever.  it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia.  mhravitch.
why me?
look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, i will.
do you think you won?
where are they?
i believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  what were your words...  'a fucking c.d.  this case is closed.'
yes, you do. now concentrate.
what are you thinking?  we were only supposed to scare him!
what happened?
i don't know, beth.  i'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. but it can.  when harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  then you found the book, remember in your lab.  then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
not another bill?
okay, lady. out.
all right, since i got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
i should have vito go with you all the time.
obviously you don't think so, and i don't know why.
that's right. i owe you a dollar sixty.
but what?
[not this way. call it a little favor, call it a little thing i'm going to do for you. i'm going to make chicago come alive for you. you'll owe me one.]
benjamin -- you're -- i don't know what to say -- you're --
you could get hurt doing that, doctor.
i had to be the ham! i had to shoot off my mouth!
yes.  they weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
that's disgusting!
what's that? oh!  who gave you this? how much is it? wolfi, who gave you this?
that's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  huh, mom?
let her go.
welcome aboard, admiral. i believe you know my trainee crew. certainly they have come to know you.
i'm telling you, smitty, the board of hudsucker is up to something --
you'll like it here.
-- what could he have done to warrant that?
while greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
i tell mine that they're little men. i tell them they're strong. they make me feel joy. i let 'em know. so they really know that i need them just as much. you know. just as much man. and you know, you're their godfather...
well, nobody asked yuh.
where'd you find your little bodyguard?
yeah... rye whiskey?
ha ha.  that's very funny, buzz.  this is serious!!
yeah.
victor. i love you,
alright?
someone's there.
shit o dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. the nerve of those twits. what do they know about female odor? don't interrupt. here's my concept. my ranch out west? it's a beauty ranch. oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. but it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. my ranch is named the rubber rose, after the rubber rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. so get this. it's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- siwash lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. i've never seen them, understand, but i hear they're magnificent. very big specimens -- i mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. it's just the wildest show in nature. it's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. dears, it's overwhelming. and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv. right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope. with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground. in a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum. and a can of dew. off-camera, a string quartet is playing debussy. a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. are you starting to get it? doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? my very goodness gracious! grandiose, lyrical, erotic and girl scout- oriented; you can't top it. i've hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. you're my eternal favorite. princess grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; anyway, dear, i'm out of photography now and into water colors. ah how circuitous conversation is! we're back at the beginning. the exact man i've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
this time it's for real?
remember, she's a schuyler.
the shadows suit us, frost. we've existed this way for thousands of years. who are you to challenge our ways?
don't louis --
the only way to win out here is to surrender.  you have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
he thinks you want him to look at evidence.
keep it to yourself.
mr. scott...
take her off the list.
let me go! let me go!
nothing that i can't handle though, lloyd.  thanks.
he's a boxer. a flyweight.
it's john. john...  znhcneelsky.
not really...
why, yes.
has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
i am the dark master!
friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis.
a -- a week.
exactly. and once you'd killed him you'd be lost. like me.  all this has to be a choice. otherwise...it's a curse.
hello?
i'd like you to switch to the day shift, mike.  to be home for dinner. helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner... that's why he's on the morning shift.
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
i thought you might be able to make a connection.
ok.
so you're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger?
there's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
great. you look great.  you both do.
but the boss knows i always been loyal.
...mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam..."
you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
i don't know what it's called, father, all i know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
...but that's two hundred dollars. this is blood money...
you sound as if you hate it.
i was born near here.  but after my mother died, my dad moved.  i grew up out in rossmore park.
each show is worse than the next.
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car?
i admit it -- you are better than i am.
yessir.
a full night on the street and this is all?
i know, but i got a stomickache. i ain't hungry.
case closed, okay?  thirty seconds.
yes.
nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  there was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. anyway, when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution.
if you really mean it, i will.
a man just called.  he asked her everything!
i know he's around here someplace.
unfortunately not, sir. a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable mr. alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
hey. slow down. what is it?
hi, lindsey, this is paul. is annie there?
that's all we know about.  most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. a suck mark. these don't. so, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  you could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. i know that's pretty thin...  he bites a lot.
get into business with this crew, identify them.  illuminate their network.  if you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  we'll indict and take it from there...
but i guess my best just isn't good enough.
i ruined? with all due respect, i told you to abort --
this is your problem, right here. this girl's driving you insane, ethan. let me help you.
then i called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
if that's all right.
...headaches...you have that...i get such bad headaches...
it's only a little way, mr. august.
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
what an incredible view !
the same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
a sign from whom?
what's up, sugar?
but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
it's a lotta dough. if i was to run across that dame, you know what i'd do?
what?
thank you.
long time.
shut you mouth or you'll be next.
don't be scared.
adorable. what time are they supposed to be here?
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer.
closer to eight.
looks like you done it.
we went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  but you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
we're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
i think her father did it. how come they can't find his ass?
i beg your pardon, brother. what did you say you were hunting?
it's a miracle!!!
mrs. rand...
ai! boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
is this your house?
how are you feeling today?
we have to go into that cabin and search it, sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
damn it!
tell him not to waste time calling. to get over here soon as he can. i think thorwald's pulling out tonight.
comrades, why should we lie to each other? it's wonderful.
i love to dream, i just hate ones about my dad.
my father worked in televison. my mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
not at all.  i enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
for a new kenworth. that's a truck.
he... apologized, he begged me. he can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...

you're enshrined in his heart and memory.  unassailable. which works out great.
i'm sorry, doctor.  georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
yeah--why--
no, it reproduces asexually. that's why we must find the nest. if we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
um, erin?  listen.  even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
ok, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
you never sent the ships. don't bother lying. it doesn't matter. westley will come for me anyway.
sometimes i wonder what they talk about.
men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but i love you. i do, i do. did you know that? did you know that i love you?
hi, i'm detective mark dargus. l.a.p.d. can i ask what you have in that bag?
jack, are you really dead?
i always t-tell the truth.  that's why i'm here.
yes.
really.
the more he thrashes, the better.
what?
how soon can we get something?
life. i said, "life."
we could have the whole left wing? wouldn't that be nice! would that be room enough for us?
who are we talking about?
uh, no, i didn't see him at all.
would you?  would you...?  or you're gonna what, fire me?
so what can i help you find tonight, lucy?  we've got it all.  best selection in santa carla.
i know it sounds funny, but i'm gonna try.
a trip to the outer rings. whad'ya think of that ?
why so briefly?
ah! my dulcet darling. tonight we marry. tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  and you've quit the force.  a permanent physical disability?
that's all beside the point. the concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
what do you know of my husband?
... it gives me a great sense of history.
mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... tuttle
i've been frozen for thirty years, man, i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
please.
remove her gag!
all systems go!
-- well no. it never came up.
yes, i was lying.
i got the diamond.  quell problemo, bruce?
oh.  well, i live--
how's that 700 bucks coming?
as soon as i heard about it, i called you.  this thing is big! his arms indicate big.
jack foley.  you've probably heard of me.
i am father vogler. i am a chaplain here. i thought you might like to talk to someone.
...she can go up there.
oh, i know.
oh, it isn't like that.
one more thing, gentlemen. the kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
mr. holland?
hey you hear the news. i just got a job at a new firm: "dewey, cheat 'em and howe." yuk yuk.
romeo is…italian. always in and out of love.
you're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
thanks for the break. bandit, this here's the dixie chicken.
yeah.
this on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
did he say why?
how'd you like that course?
yeah, he went south ahead of us. i guess we'll catch him before...
if you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
maybe they didn't get here.  maybe they've been here.
why don't you come with us.
may i have this dance?
get into bed.
do you play the piano?
why wouldn't you think that about me?
afraid of the hospital?
for a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
you are down for protecting malcolm's widow aren't you?
you okay?
i thought you were never going to call me.
yeah, right.  you want to try again?
up there they wouldn't be a problem.
well you got time for 'em now. anything interesting?
forgive me, sire. i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
he's gonna plea-deal his way out. give up this ace stunt man now one of the west coast dope kings, if they go easy on the cat.
you're a fool!
two or three years ago i would have stayed.  and fucked you.
all right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. okay? you happy? so now what?
there is no fucking hand-off, walter! at a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
i still haven't made up my mind yet.
-- from czechoslovakia?  and how long have they been livin' in your building?  alright, i'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  milos and tamina karlova.  they were quiet and kept to themselves.  landlord don't know who your girl is.
do you think you are a real master?
are you coming...?
hello, miss channing.
i don't know --
now run along, daniel.
i just got here myself, susan.
as a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, i'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  twenty five percent.
it was like... nothing was there... and then justin appeared and the core... became metal...
i did go.  just back.  reef, these are a couple of our passengers - sir ian hunt, and dr. clifford kent.  my exec, commander richard holloway.
i told my dad before he died, i'd take care of mom. and i'll do it.  this guy wants to kill you?
you mean--here?
not an option.
sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. sometimes not by half.
-- and then my tongue, i suppose. i killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake i don't mean to duplicate tonight.
but still, you can't be sure.
say what?
apparently he has the letters.
you plan on driving trucks all your life?
you changed your mind.
i'm thirty-seven?
carmine? he was here before. i saw him. he had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
now, that's all right, isn't it?
yeah, i read your book. "mike" had the same problems as "chad" the stockbroker.
no, not that. i'm talking about the associated press. they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i. did you tell them that we were lying?
just like this.
why?
you aren't staying?
it's a long story, this one.
don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. did he die?
don't worry. i'm gonna get you out of here.
it's wood.  ed wood.
i know what you're doing.
my, that fudge smells yummy!
i don't want to die.
flying the plane.
you're sure...
where's little bill for christ sake?
rangers, eh?
seek you the bridge of death ...
a lucky guess.
mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. it's a very fine line.
you're the only human being i care for.
are you okay?
you guessed wrong.
some good ones.
i was starting to believe you, you know? that you weren't who everyone said. i guess i was wrong --
would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? what was the point of all that hard work?
guess what.
sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
if that little weasel ever walked in here i wouldn't serve him.
ah, a philosopher.
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas...
how do you know it's not drugs?
paul, this is positively the best misery you've ever written.
give up, castor.  people are going to find out.
what is there to say?  they know what john bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
i'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
now, you just find him, son.
how old is he?
it's always been one of my favorite names.
you didn't?
it is the work of untouchables.
when do you deliver your project?
you didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on christmas day when you were unwrapping that prada bag i gave you.
yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
it's not breakfast yet.
what is it, miss vivian?
you're not?
it's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. you don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
get the outside shutters.
you're frankie lazzaro. the gangster from rhode island.
we've already played our cards, major. there's no turning back.
no, no, i'm fine.
i 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
but he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
gus, have you ever been in love?
you won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  you also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
you open?
sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours.
man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
ten bucks apiece.
ow?...
mmm. and what else...?
that would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
i still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
anything i can do back here?
let's call that a start.
hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
not exactly. just thought i'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  you know the next investigation we get into i hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. this one has been nothing but climbing stairs. and when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
what are you talking about?
detective williams here. is that you, jeffrey?
honey, i'm not, please...
so how come you know so much about those countries?
yes.
which means i gotta fence it for two. who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
it may have happened, but not the way you said.
and he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
do you think so? do you think so?
i heard sir te lost something.  and now madame te's not feeling well...
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
i have no idea.  they put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  the shutters up here are nailed shut.
is the hatchet buried between the english and my french father?
you don't even know jacqueline gibson.
hey, dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
shit.  it's my galiano.
i realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... i wish you'd reconsider.
really? you're such a talented actor.
what the fuck you mean you burned it?
who put this item in about the comic?  "if there's a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  we were too busy screaming." does this temple have a press agent?
you going to call the police?
at least i've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
but i am history.
then, you also understand that you must die.
nick... sal is very weak. he suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
i can't protect you anymore.
coffee? nah, i gotta go.
you're a soldier, max.  that's what you were put here for.  but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
i did.
wrong number  nooooooo!
we're goosed! goosed by god!
i believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  surely st. michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
hey marv, he demanded confidentiality...
at least i tried something.
paul, this will be our legacy.
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet.
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town.
cool. see you later.
whaddya wanna talk about?
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, deborah? and then, your brother’s not buried yet. as i said earlier, an autopsy will...
i have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
you look beautiful.
yo, dela, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
it's the truth, i swear.
so i could watch the girl that lived under me.
why can't you talk to me?
you're kidding? what did they say?
i'm still here.
you gonna tell me what happened with you and exley?
me seduce you? honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  i just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
she wants you to paint the ashtray.
wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
aah!
i don't know...
it's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. it's pretty much discarded these days, except by the catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. it has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. it was purely the force of suggestion. the victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
you're right, jack.  sorry... jack approaches alan.
the new store?
son?
it would serve you right if you were left behind.
boy, to think i could maybe make my own.
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
just a quick word, ms. langenkamp.  for dylan's sake.
no, um... i was gonna take a cab.
it's not a real picture, stacy, it's been doctored-up.
why, it has just made me ill, buddy. i'm sick. i don't want to eat nothin', i don't, and me i got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. i'm ill.
sure, i like a woman with some meat on her bones.
how much more do they need than your death at his hands?
do you think that's such a good idea?
summer colds are the worst.
just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
mr. decker... i will contact you every five minutes. otherwise... inform mr. scott immediately.
would you like to know what's in it? the report.
now remember --
then why are you doing it?
i don't get a klepto vibe from you. evil genius? maybe. arsonist? wouldn't rule it out.
what's going on? let go of me! stewardess! i'll never fly this airline again!
my god, all this time...i never stopped loving you...
wait, rewind. do you really think she hooked-up with our rob? they're so--different.
because i'll be firing at them.
we're going to get some food.
don't look at your feet, and i don't want to see anybody counting.  make it look easy.  again!
man, this is gonna delay everything. spanky's gonna be pissed.
what is it?  your legs?  hands?
guess!
we have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.

what do you do?

what was that, korfin?
doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
i don't want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
how are you? how's business?
well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, azteca...
you're very brave, louis.  good luck.
okay, now you gone and done it. you done messed with my business bitch!
where are you going?
would you like a drink? it's right beside you...
i'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
we're going to get in by studying imperial procedures?  i don't like it.
...as the advertising says: tomorrow never lies.
of course he is.  freddy's dead and gone.
you already know what they are.
well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those group ther'py shindigs? bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
and then?
how was the flight? they take care of you okay? long way from norfolk, isn't it?
it is for your security that i have come, your majesty -- for the security of your honor.
he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
icey, i don't want a husband.
hardcore outfit.  the best i ever trained.
enid! i'm so sorry about what happened.
uh, i don't know.
don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch i was.
i know how to say "hello". teach me how to say "good-bye", that's all i need.
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
do it on your own time, paddy.
i wish he'd tell that to citrine.
it was great seeing you again.  i'm glad you dropped by.
and what did she die of, exactly?
a cop?
what do you want to do?
it you really loved me, steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
who did?
help me rhonda.
you and vito are gonna pull that payroll job. right now.
wait here.
everything's okay, believe me. i know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
so it's an honor?
well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
thirty seconds. that's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
i am impatient with stupidity. my people have learned to live without it.
that's the reason.
tell 'em i went fishin'!
all right then. it's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
well, another day, another dollar.  stop staring at me!!
i'm just giving you the truth.  there was a time when william parrish liked the truth.
i think i prefer to see my client privately.
what is it?
it is always less with my living. far or near.  but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  there is power in this.  and as long as you and i live, the knight can never have it all.
come on. how much?
i don't know.  i felt like it.  i never saw anyone get done before.
oh, gee, i don't know.  um...
x marks the spot.
she must have been in love with you.
plague? there's no possibility of that, is there?
not right now, jerry.
neo, this is loco.  they've got morpheus in a military-controlled building.  even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  three of them!  i want morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
you looking for somebody?
thank you, herb.  you're a wonderful man.  you really are. everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the little league.
then for god's sake, don't be a detective.  stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  patrol, internal affairs, but not the bureau.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
you go, it's all stairs, i can take it from here.
i'm sure of it. just as i'm sure there's a wish for shangri-la in everyone's heart. i have never seen the outside world. but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. oh, i just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
he wants your wisdom.
rayette.
good for you.
what happened to his tooth?
would you check out my studio some time?
yes.
i can't get over what those guys did to her. i just can't.
mr. merrick likes the food here. don't you john?
come on. it's christmas. at least stay for breakfast.
that's right, i set you up. you're a veteran at this, dutch, i had to.
i can't do that.
just be yourself.
sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
are you sure?
where's it coming?  where's he landing?
any priors ? any police record ?
well! come on!
well, i guess it's getting late. please thank kathryn for the use of her steinway.
never let the sun go down on an argument, jody used to say.
we did some researching in the archives. sid, something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother's murder. for two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth.
anyway, uh... my point is you're young. a kid really, your whole life ahead of you. but it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. before it all washes away.
what about your wife?
it says here, name danger powers.
hello, peter.
you lame taylor?
what's that for?
what...
ten-four. el toro de oro. blast off.
you know what gets me?
waddaya gonna do now?
what?
you'd feel what?
so what brings you out tonight?
i don't know about anyone else, but i could use a refresher in latin.  eight o'clock in my room?
no.  did he really?
the day after tomorrow.
why, victor? why? what were you thinking?
he did.  look, i know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
we were in the nick of time.  you were in great peril.
that's not what i hear.
where is everybody?
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
hell of a war.
yes. the vampire apocalypse. it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst.
oh, ted, please be careful. i worry about you so much.
about fuckin' time if you ask me. i'm just going through the motions till i drop out anyway.
this is it, betty.  they'll find us again, fog or no fog.
findley.
hey, dorothy!
debra, you're fuckin' insane.
hey, ed. did you hear about marcia?
that's right.  they treat you like scum i bet?
shep said you'd be here at 7:30. what gives, man?
what the hell? why not? where should we go?
how was dinner?
on accounta...
charlie, this is business.
you want a tip?
i didn't mean it that way.
hey. look. there must be something.
i have no idea what you're talking about.
there's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
'stanwyk's parents, marvin and velma stanwyk, also of provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
...that's an old one.
the bailey building and loan. it was up there.
oh.
wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
maybe it's because i live here.
beautiful!
you've been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
so what should we do?
yes... yes, i do.
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. i handed it to him on a silver platter. i told my father and those people...
piety is for sunday! and two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
stay open.  who knows?  lightning could strike.
where are the sand-cat tracks? why aren't we still following them?
how much is it?
what are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, buzz?
who are you?
is that why the assembly was convened?
no.
needs chris!  must have chris!
well, here's the deal, max.  this thing i'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
and what?
and you think this creature is one of them?
last night?... there was no applause.
oui. nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
i didn't mean for any of this to happen.
they don't speak english...
it's a good day.  i feel good.
i paid off the mortgage! i ordered that winnebago you always wanted! now you're ashamed of me?
what?
yeah.
the next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the british consul.
i saw thum! i saw thum!
tastes good to me. you live around here, stephanie?
i should have tried. it should have been me on that beach back there, not billy.
you take her.
_two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _second_ bank of gotham on the _22nd_ how could harvey? _two_-face resist?
i remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
mrs. bundy, you don't seem to understand. this young lady says there was an attack on the school.
bobo isn't after you! bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! but so am i. i'm a survivor, roy. i survive.
what the - ? how did you - ?
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one...
umm, i don't know. i can look it up.
if you're selling girl scout cookies i'm borderline diabetic.
another sex dream?
what's wrong with that?
what is it?
dr. marcus... good. we're en route to you and should be there in three days.
i'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
hello there.
how long you been up there, fink?
roper.
it's not <u>you</u>, it's...
who is this.
and ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
go where?
i thought you met someone else.
mr. mulwray, please.
i don't see the connection.
oh, man...
ohhh-hh, ohhh...
i just called a second ago.  there was no answer.  i'm at a payphone.
i wondered about them, for so many years. i wondered if i looked like them, acted like them. i wondered why they gave me up.
i'll make it up to you this summer. i promise.
no one ever comes here.  my mother told me stories about it late at night.  they tell all the children.
stop it!
the twenty-five thousand dollar one.  the one with your name on it.  in bernard barker's florida account.  bernard barker, the watergate burglar--
i don't know where to go.  the hotel is surrounded.
but still, you can't say cbs wouldn't love to break something like --
how did he do that?
ten is standard, sir.
not that truth!
not yet. he's near "m" and 34th. i've got an elsur unit on the scene now. a residential building. twelve units.
two-hundred-and-fifty. very reasonable. let's leave a big tip, shall we? my place hr a nightcap?
a wolf.
...maybe i die for nick...
he'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
huh? oh, no.
that's precisely the point, captain. we don't know it will do. moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
there was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  what is it you want?
did you hear that?
hello?
in this case, getting married means nothing. aren't we already the same as being married? and corrado and giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
yeah, i took 'em. so what?
rose, i don't --
lots of shelters were in this bill.
where <u>is</u> it?
if you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
what have you done?
shit, we just started.  but i better log out of this.
my scar is a war-wound.
i don't mind.
you will.
it can't work.
well, i'm in new york now.  what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
maybe he's turned her into one of them. they enter the crowd around the helicopter.
but you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. why isn't it stupid?
and you listen to that?
there are some who call me tim?
--sloan told the grand jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
pretty radical, johnny.  even for you.  why don't you pull it?
yeah, i know...synapses neurong...
it's not easy to be calm when -
how long have you been here?
why, that's just sense, son. now a man like daniel webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. but he's worth it -- and he helps others. makes all the difference.
low tide at cable junction is 7:46 p.m.
you mean, like...  oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', clementine... ? huckleberry hound? that sort of thing?
we can climb out.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
one hundred and five. carrot juice.  lot's of it. i swear, it's almost not worth it. i piss orange. oh, and i, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. but nobody wants to die, schwartz.
and lexapro, yes.
oh, gruesome. i wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
what do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
what?
lieutenant, i have a top secret clearance. the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you.
adelle?
you know how long i've been looking for that?!
you all right?
well, let's say i live in it. such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
lucky nothing.  i had to empty my damn gun into him.
the goddamn smell is always the same. 
anything -- anything. -- you can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
it's too politicized with you in there, anyway. they need to be able to stick their necks out.
want to sit down? did you need somethin'?
like what?
yeah, i heard rumors.
no kung pao chicken.  never.
you wanna take my statement, i'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get paid.
how's our deal coming along?
what the fuck are you talking about.
there you are, ted-baby. everything all right?
i wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the army medical corps.
we're still not where we're going.
he's not here.
bridge!  can anyone hear me?!
you people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. i'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... what sort of training do you have anyway?
well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
i could use a half-dozen more arms ...i've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
you kids off to the dance?
don't be such a fucking smart ass.
nope.  sounds more like the first.
what do you mean? we're black ain't we? and we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
did the justice lawyers sign off?
dad, i really think we should call the cops.
attagirl! why, they'll be naming streets after you -- hildy johnson street! there'll be statues of you in the parks, hildy. the radio'll be after you -- the movies!  by tomorrow morning i'll betcha there's a hildy johnson cigar! i can see the billboards now. light up with hildy johnson!
when was that?
hey, i'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
all night?
we'll never find the baron's castle.
i had my kid brother, dominick, run it for me.
could we go upstairs and talk? it's so loud down here.
it's not sucking, sir.
i didn't know you had this.
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate.
yes. yes, someone's got to feed them.
why?
why? so you can beat yourself up? sitting around in that stuffy apartment. it's just plain bad for you, man. it's depressing. you've come so far. remember the first week? after she told you? you couldn't even eat.
now, i'd advise you to wait outside.  it'll be eas--
well. i hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. pitching right in. lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. you're smart. in fact, *i* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
hello, joe. sorry. just a little gag of mine. thought i'd have some fun with you.
lonnie elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
they're supposed to be evidence.    that's why bastaldi set this up.
hey, stirling fucking moss --
it's the damn money men.  you never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  and then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
i could, but it's confidential.  look, the point is, we didn't talk.  i told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
i have two right feet.

i don't think that's how i would describe him.
who?
it's just a mongoose.
you look very pretty.
can we go up to the crime scene?
so you killed your father.
what the fuck for?
good idea.
right. so we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. is that it?
she can't be here without me.
at the church... you were following me weren't you?
push and twist, it's child proof.
what does it look like?
any other psychotic relatives i should know about?  jason?  freddy krueger?
hello?
the mirror is broken.  it was broken when i found it.
i think so.
yes.
good.
who speaks that name!
what's next?
do you have any other old records besides these?
oh my god! sidney, you ran fast or what?  hey.
oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
what were they saying? about you? in there?
when i get back i'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
have them sealed off.
i know, i know ... you thought i was dead. that's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of russia, which i should have been - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
chair, cup and ball.
it's very kind of you to offer, but --
you're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. i'll send morgan or lambert.
i'm fine peggy sue. and how are you? are we talking on the phone? are we pen pals?
it is.
do me a favor, mitchell. find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
thank you, hank. we're on it. what were you doing out at sidney's tonight?
what do you want for free?
what happened?
of course.
you told him i was throwing a deuce, right?
you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  teddy was furious when he found out i'd taken tranquilizers!
ridiculous. that answer is a contradiction in terms. tell us, bright eyes, why do men have no souls? what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  there aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. it's all goddamn beach break.
you know what we do to welchers, cluett, don't you?
no. this is serious. one more hour in this town and i'll kill somebody!
i regret i can't spend the time i'd like with your exhibition, but i'm going to worry the life out of you when i come back. 
we're supposed to meet him here. is ruiz on the list?
it's alright.  he means it.
you look great.
* so i'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * the world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? my actions			   * still have meaning, even if i can't			    * remember them. my wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether i know about it.			    *
tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  not near ready.  not by the longest shot.  aaron's spent six weeks in tripoli, he's interviewed gaddafi -- he reported on the eight-one story.  i think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and i think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
i'm out, johnny.
yeah.
it's everything we wanted.  a very good read.  a terrific piece of work.  so, here's to you and suez.
i would have missed it -- but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked.  it looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  it's been erased without any input signal coming in.
he can have my place. i don't want to go anyway.
i've taken the spear for a lot of people, sway. including you. can't we improvise a little here ... ?
saturn. beautiful.
the man's gone black, barnes.  he's under until he decides to surface.
"a habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
may i help you, sir?
what?
get out of here!
you swore.  you owe me a quarter.  did you remember my egg carton?  i told you i needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
you're a hard man to trust, sir. you sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
well, still the same old place then, eh?
nice spot.
you know what really excites me about you?
what about dinner sometime, when you get back?  would that be... ?
guy says he made the trade in gillette, wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
they didn't teach it at memorial hospital.  i had my suspicions, though, about the directress of training.
know what?
i'm afraid not. i promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
...it.
i assume you want something?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
enough with the clothes--
could i just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
eggs. how do you like them?
he was supposed to come skiing. i didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
well, thirty-three, but i'm not counting del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  you probably feel i'm flattering myself to see us together.
yeah?
then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
i think thomas pynchon's a genius.
grasp firmly. then what?
it's okay. listen-
er, called noggs, sir actual name is norris-newman. he presented credentials from "the standard".
parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. it's the twentieth century.
i know that.  i'm just -- i'm nervous.  i reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. i know they're song lyrics.  and i know how i feel.
she was?
leave me alone! he's going to kill me!!
what's your point?
you did the right thing. never try to understand a press message. about half the time we use codes -- especially with dr. gonzo.
i wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
you find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
yeah.
it's ours.
what do you want with my baby?
dear god.  where are we, lieutenant?
hey, i'm a private detective, van dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids. i've been to that scumbag town. it's full of them.
dr. zira, i'd like to kiss you good-bye.
it was the only way to solve certain problems --
shit.
i don't know if you've seen it, but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek.
tonight. what's tonight?
do you know what that is?
nice tie, lt. anus, sir.
i tell you, something's not right here.  how do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
how much longer?
then teach me how.
what pills?
so why, after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house, does the senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
will you wait for me?
i run over to victoria.  play some golf with some people i know.  do it all the time.  that's why i have a cabin cruiser.  custom- built.forty knots.  mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  member of six golf clubs.  broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course.  you have to be good to do that, and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on mr. brandon's boat, the valkyrie.  came alone?  sure.  he always comes alone.  mr brandon's a rather lonely man.
what's slow?
don't ever do that to me again.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
didn't i teach you to always arch your back?
it's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
...don't you drink?
first han, now you.  when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
we already played that game. you lost, remember?
it was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  to your face, anyway.
one simple word, three little letters. yes.  that's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  big houses, legit business...

well?
and falling in love?
helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week.
later, beloved... now i wish only to be with you...
stay, adrian.  i just -- every once in a while, i need to talk to someone human.  he doesn't think like we do.  he doesn't even feel what we feel.  i mean -- he even scares the research teams.
it's clear.
you think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  you think you're toughening me up?  well, you're not!  you're quitting, fine... but i'm staying.
a toast to whatever he just said.
george?  what do you know about cocaine?
the same day she supposedly went down.
what about us? don't forget to mention us.
does it make you... hard?
why did he come out here? what's going on?
they found the safe.
sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
there's nothing to be done about it.
first off, letty, can you tell me where you are?
was it sister marguerite?
where did you learn it?
there's a big, comfy california king over in bedding.  what say we ...
it's michael.  how are you, mom?
i didn't say that.
please.  i don't want to scare you.
whatever it is, i'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.

well, i don't care who she is.  we can't sing without her!
did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
he didn't want me to.
no, not homeless people. beggars, francis begbie -- one of my mates. i wouldn't say my best mate, i mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. i need something to persuade her that i was there. get me something to take to her.

speck is dead.
i'm not exactly sure... it looks close. did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?

look, i must have pupils. without pupils i can't manage.
i've got to work...
hey, make up your mind, will you?
wait you two. dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this. can you guess what it is ?
i also promised tyrell.
the others already told me, o'neil. they wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  because you went soft on another women --
full power, sir.
isn't the plumage beautiful?
oh, it's so soft.
no, no, please. this fare's on me. please.
we are looking for you.
what do you want to know?  what difference does it make?  i'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  i make you feel good. you make me feel good.  what the hell else do you want from a guy?
what limes?
some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
you get quick action, don't you?
ah. an explorer.
i turn it on when i confront the guy.
that's what i'm saying.
you like that vaughan?
on your property?
he asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
i'm here.  where are you?
i am?
come again?
we're doing hearst.
i don't need it that badly. i don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy.
it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. that's what you projected on the bridge.
i can't believe it! "yes i think"... how she kids me! i can't believe it!  and did he pass your threshold or not?
i did my best but, well, you know me
good night, my love.
i mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? i don't get it. don't they get confused? "is that mine? i thought it was yours." hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
i was talking to dad.
there's ... another exit?
what about me?
she's crazy.  you should have killed her.
what took so long?  you were in there all day.
no proof?
any trouble?
excuse me for having something important to do.
you've never said that before.
wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
no thanks.  i carry my own.
you know this guy?
you want me to spell it out? there's nothing here.
h-hell yeah. i killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
yes?
what the hell?
is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  whatever the price?  isn't that what makes a man?
oh, okay, can i call?
what the hell you looking at me like that for?
what'd he say?
please?  i'm dyin' of thirst in here.
maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
that i would have to make a choice...
take your money? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
yah, not too bad. so it's nice up there?
thanks for coming.
whatcha got?
adam. dollface. we had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
where?
the funny thing -- i'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. i'm absolutely honest with you. i've told you my feelings. but you, first of all i know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
you can't -- can't!  stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  i know it's all right.
i feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
that's a secret.
hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  probably.
where's your coat and hat?
toys for adults. where are your toys for adults?
what's up with you? bladder infection?
how long have you been up?
she couldn't.
oh, nothing much.  you know...
in case of what?
o, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circled orb, lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than i do.
no.
you got no choice. it's over.
i don't know.
i made other plans. you can have both tickets.
hi. you didn't answer your beeper.
who?
you mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
getting ready to invade.
walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
you miss her, huh?
in front of greely's. it says, "this here is what happens to..."
leave it on! now we are going to do this thing. we are going to have a conversation. think of another topic.
you all sure about this?
how is that helping, natalie? how exactly?
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow.
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
ah, no sir. i had planned to see them in the morning.
i'm looking for a lady who works here.
why me?
what does charlie mean?
can you just go off...?
except for small eyes.
what she call you?
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
i heard that was you.
sorry i'm late, sid. that back nine at riverdale is really murder.
also, melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight, okay.
so you light, ain't you. you light about a half-a-million.
see?  we're for real.
no! no, it's him!
you've only had sex with three different people?
he's got his priorities?
in the future, we'll be better.
ahh!  ah!
you're kidding. you wrote a song? is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
you got beer?
the minute i saw you. i said to myself, she's a weaver.  have you ever used a loom?
beth you're losing it.  c'mon.
barbatus, hang on -- barbatus!!
your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  we've been in here calling...
yes, but...
thanks for nothing! i hate snakes!
then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants!
alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "glad i finally met you", "you always seemed nice", "wish i could have known you more"...
listen, you don't havta come?
cinderella man! babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. can you imagine cobb's face when he reads this?
he says you were bar mitzvahed there, in march 1988.
huh? oh... yeah.
i'm a lifesaver. a lighthouse. up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. i stay lit for you. i stay lit. i don't go dark. i never go dark!
don't need it.  we're scattering the ashes.
i don't understand. you just said he said no.
cause if you're losing your mind, i got a right to know.
i'm confused about your past is the thing.
all right... i'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
i knew you'd come. and i knew i'd have to come up here and talk to you. i couldn't let you go back without any word. i came to tell you again -- jessica cannot be cured.
something wrong?
we haven't implanted it yet.
eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
you all want to lay off?  god.  i hope the iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
to see your reaction.
peter, i... i...
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan?
very outspoken, too. said i looked funny. wasn't that cute?
i admire them.
hi, joe.
i can't, all right! jesus, would you leave me alone? i can't make changes like that in my life. if i could, i would-but i don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
see?  nothing.
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well. and a dead d-8 on the deck.
look, baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and i'm putting you in the top ten. now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
sure...
but you know what the thing is, fergus?
do i know any gigs?
her doctors have. jamie and i. we're still praying for a miracle.
yeah. no. it's ok. what's goin' on?
oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  so who's this guy?
is that margie?
lydia, i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  you help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
nick, alex, how are we today?
well, he'd have to hurry.  my flight leaves at four o'clock.
she needs help.
ms. heller said not to talk to you.
i'll be right here... i promise.
fine. i'm fine. how are you?
aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
i know a couple.
found this, but the battery's dead.
you're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
the cart they brought elly kedward into the woods with--
you don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
47.
honest, toby.  i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
carmine left?
wussup?
i assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
well, i come back, didn't i?
launch the da vinci virus? you can't do that!
killing lessons?  heartwarming.
and you like it.
why are you crying?
honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... these hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and i am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  is webb really en route and montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before british reinforcements arrive?
doctor v. l. pemberton.  i knew it.  he's a scientist all right. inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine.  i'm telling you, artemus, loveless is our man.
cute.
you were up late last night, too, rose.
let me take you out tomorrow night... pleeease.
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
...worst possible time for me.
then don't bug me.
you're not driving jess no more. two strikes, bobby, and this last one was big. the bachelor's father goes to my schul.
excellent.
what for?
wally...
mary clarence!
you've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  all right, you win. i'll just have to get used to you. i admit i'm licked. but only because i'm worried. i've had detectives all over the country searching for her. i've seen thousands of photographs. fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  haven't slept one night this week. if i don't find her, i'll go crazy.
look, i told you...
it's still my money. if you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
i like it.
what do you imagine you are louis?
...yah, okay...
congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army!
-- even if i give you a million as well?
mama???
always. ow.
oh... hi.
what fire and music?
where you signed this?
i asked you...
come on, fran -- don't be like that. you just going to sit there and keep bawling?  you won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  look, i know you think i'm stalling you. but when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "pass the sugar -- and i want a divorce." it's not that easy.  anyway, this is the wrong time. the kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- i can't bring it up now.  this isn't like you, fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
you left a print! there was kel that didn't go off! there was a partial print, they tracked it back to treadstone! they know it's you!
but he killed a lot of men, too.
uh, i come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. see, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, don ward is a very well-liked man in this town. he's got lots of friends here. now, his family and their money go back many, many years. now, friends vote... family and money votes. that's important to me... and you. and if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
you put the mommy too far away. mrs. boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
what the hell do you want?
of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
oh yeah?
my idea.  muchly.  my sketches. big heavy brow.  head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
like what? looking like me? like a nigger?! why don't you want to look like what you are? what makes you ashamed of being black?
that's right. that's what i said. you have a good memory. then what?
yeah?
i haven't changed anything.  damn.
elaine, i gotta put you on hold...
we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
that's a matter of opinion.
it's okay, everything's okay now.
see. money don't buy happiness. i must say, she's taking it well.
t-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
i told you it would happen. it's bound to happen when a man works alone!
sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in special needs.
well, if he had been italian, they could have been shot off. sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, if they blow a job or something.
what about captain medley? he never told them what happened to you over there. his testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
what are you talking about?
alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  you don't need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
kelly's file.  read it.  you're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
yeah.
good morning.
oh, that!  don't take it personally. he always wakes up before i do. down boy!  roseanne barr naked!
nike specials. two hundred bucks.
i'm kind of busy.
we've subpoenaed the auction house's records.
plenty of time.
i don't know.
i've got more. you better tell me.
mmm-more like -- i have a little trouble. trusting people.
this one is particularly interesting. it's a hari-kari blade.
how the fuck do you do that?
i thought you'd gone to work.
how can you say that? i mean,  who said i-i-i-i said that you, i and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
she's an officer.  there's a higher standard.
he's a very private person, actually.
before i became involved with paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  playboys. thrill seekers. middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her.
damn...
technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
that works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
i like him, mom.
you don't know that.
the last few days, um... i've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  i want to tell you... i'm starting to understand why you left me.  i've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... i want to apologize, for all of it.  for shutting you out, for not being there.  i...  anyway, i hope you can forgive me.
will we see you later?
an emergency situation has arisen. by order of starfleet command, as of now, 1800 hours, i am assuming command of this vessel. duty officer so note in the ship's log. plot a new course: for space laboratory regula i.  mr. scott?
i've never been to earth. i've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
come on in. what you been up to?
ow.
he says their medicine is that much more advanced.  he was very nice about it. but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
dad?
they said that'd be tomorrow.  they just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
all right.  i'll be right back.
i'm rash and i'm stupid and what am i doing with you?
i'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, mrs. otto, but the walkers said you would understand.  i know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
why?
huh. i’m a businessman. what are you, eh?
everywhere i go, they point and whisper! at the opera, they hiss at me when i take my box. when i went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said i was already damned! why must i suffer for your sins?
boy. i had a feeling today was going to be the day... helicopter.
i'm looking for them.
you don't believe me, huh?  look, i'll show you. it's all in this book.
i hope you make your peace with jabba.
because i wanted to.
i don't care.
thank you, nicky. cause now i'm gonna bust adrian's head wide open.
so.  the final countdown.
pretend you're me.  you find this. what would you do?
i'm at adele delisi's.
oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "hey, i have something i just wrote," right?
later.  i want doucet first.
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
because it's quiet.  and he wants to talk.  alise -- once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
what?
why aren't you at work?
you know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer.
you want these people.
eddie what?
where is it?
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
private johnson, are you unhappy in the army?
another thing that baffles me, doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
she's four feet tall.  ed?
stop, stop... i can't remember!  the battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... i was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself...
what's up?
well?
the police still have a lot of questions for russell nash.
get out?! what does it say?
if thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
it changes things. that knowledge. doesn't it?
i know what happened.
figured that out for yourself, did you?
right.
a ride.  you want one?
not from me. i only stole it. when are you coming over to the chamberlain's men?
whose place is this again?
yes.
flame-units only.  i want rifles slung.
that...fucking...bitch!
seems a shame!
so for four thousand dollars, all i have to do is drive you to your hotel?
how will you fix it?
nice to be here.
mom.  i gotta talk to you.
oh come, neighbor stone. i wouldn't cut that tree if i were you. it means a breach of contract.
that's gotta kill him, right?
can we come up?
i suppose you're right.
hurry!
we've all done a poor job of it.
oh. that.
why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, mrs spitz?
this is the park view hotel. i'm the hotel manager. are you looking for someone?
you think we should take that chance?
have a nice trip.
watch out for her; she can give you dreams.
shoot.
but what are you doing here?
you tell me.  i remember a lot of things. i remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the devil's chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and france.
it was wade's old partner... gallagher. he was behind it all.
stop fighting.
i'm serious, frances. this is important.
mr. freeze.
i wouldn't have given my mom such a hard time about moving here if i'd known i was going to meet you.
he needs extreme cold to survive. his cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
can i talk to hearst?
your investment ideas never work out.
and you wrote that...
it was softer'n i thought, that was my main impression. you know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket.
yes.
what time is it?
godfather!
i'd like you to close your eyes.
why do you say that?
who are you really?
he's been like that for awhile. we need to get him some medicine.
that's a different dress.
it isn't finished?
ah, yes, here we are. a little craps figures.  [actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] hey - hey.
i mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  and you're going through them quick.
first wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
graham...
it's for people!
why didn't he make his move back there?
what are my choices?
what does?
namely?
it's okay.  i'm game.
no...
you think we're being set up?--christ, deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names.
i've been all fucked up since i got out.
not that mulwray?
it's -- beautiful. may i inquire as to the occasion?
i thought they were your friends?
how do i offend, my lord?
you?
anything you want, boss.
what law, merk? having fun? letting down our hair on prom night?
colonel greenhill's compliments, sir. the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field, fully armed and...
yes.
and you know, i read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
you were terrific.  and i kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
tailored specifically to each participant.  think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
well... ok... here it is... uh... i'd like you to take a look at my horse. now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
..this week's tke kegger...
the plane went down.  my friends died.  i washed up on an island.  then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.
kelly's next, gloria.
stay put!
where'd she go?
practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
say phillip, want to see the northern lights?
i don't understand what's happening. krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to dan and greta while i was awake. how's he doing it?
you are, i've seen you.
no. 
not for me.
what happened to your house?
listen to me. you're holding something very very dangerous. you've just iced 350 of your pals--
then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
well, take a look around the house.  is everything nice, but not too nice?  are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  does he give a lot of gifts?  do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
i'm sorry, i'm not.  i'm just another guy.  morpheus is the one that matters.
so?
anything else?
zander is going for pilot, too.
it's the white house.
then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
no, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
move a finger, harcourt, and you're history...
yeah, down the ... er ...
nothing much. he said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  fucking kids, huh? they take you for granted every time.
they always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
it's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  better than either one of my marriages. see, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. i don't know what it is, but it's great.
i lack the authority, buckaroo banzai.
yes.
i knew it!
what's today?
two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers.
couple of months.
help... lemme go... no, don't let me go... help...
so far you've let it cross the heart of america. for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. i don't see the humor in that.
look who's talking. you've been there.
no!!
maybe they had a big breakfast.
not the first time that's been true.  i'm telling you, i got a feeling about this guy.  this is the guy, satch.
but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle. there's no way down.
i can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
excellent, but that's where peter come in. 3jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. peter will simply escort molly to the villa. once she's in... case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
so, uh...
where?
thanks.
they make your life fun.  their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
i can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
can i cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? he's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  well yes, he could be playing with himself. mmm hmm. yes i'll ask. dade, you like girls, don't you?
money.
jamie!
what?
oh, actually it was. then why'd you call it off?
since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. just the beacon, every two minutes.
i did everything you said, but it all seemed--
it's my birthday this week. i'll be 26.
...are you with the consulate?
what a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
why?
shit!
but who would be chosen?
that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  you must try to talk about it, billy.
no, no seriously!  there's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
i don't know.
man i'm starving too, i think i'll go for the surf and turf.
why?
it's okay, i am done for.
benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
go fuck yourself...
i know. will you please leave now?
see you soon, preysing. next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
fuck you - fuck you.
whom did they choose?
add it to the list.
your majesty.  this ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of paris -- we have no way of checking --
peter kenneth appleton.  hollywood, california.
no. the shades are still drawn in their apartment.
pleasantville marathon?
but how?
i was in hell. i've been there. it's horrible. i don't want to die, louis.
it would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
if it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  what do you think?
hey!
jesus, if you're glib about this i'm going to lose it.  i was up all night and...
your bother is in america fighting the rebels.
i've moved on.
what about you?
dick laurent?
can i do what?
didn't you call?
what do you mean? what kind of person am i?
it killed him... you coulda just used draino. it's cheaper.
object to the form!
richard, shut it and keep it down.
i see.  and where is my grandfather's private library?
nothing, thank you.  nothing.  i wanted to see you...  what's mimi up to, charles?
yeah...you've fallen for her.
how about a drink?
here's where we're at.  three men in a room.  the victims here. anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. the exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but i can't make out the location. government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
how much did ya lose?
oh agnes, oh agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, i love you.
drink, drink, juanito. you'll never have it so good.
what?
to who?  are you asking me?
...you all right?
how'd you get this number?
understood, sir.
a hotel would've been fine.  we'll have to tell mr greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
why not?
what's to think about?
you designed this yourself?
how often they come here?
i don't give a damn about his girl...
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
that's a long time.
tell the other person how you feel.
ah... pity, pity...
i'm done.
you're right.  one of my associates sold the building last month.
almost four.
hello?
don't you think it's time to go now? running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
i have to see bud kruger.
what's wrong, skipper?
i had a visit from the british embassy. they think i'm a stray soccer hooligan.
uh-huh.
what did you do?
that cop didn't pull his gun.  mars lied. he just started shooting!
they don't believe her.
i swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  but if you ever met my husband, you'd know why i just can... you wanna step out of the car, please?  you wanna put your hands on your head, please?  louise, shoot the radio.
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
what happened?
jesus.
...four years ago...
you made out alright.
no, but you sucked enough dick!
i could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the hudson.
he's sittin' by the phone -
get it out of here!
your highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
james leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
why don't we just cut this routine short?  whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
will it take long to get there? how far away is he?
yeah?
want a smoke?
<u>how</u>?
here!
ben --
okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and i don't care.  i'd weather blizzards to have you. you're the most perfect man i've ever known.
call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
what are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
she didn't answer.
yeah, i understand, tommy.
barbara jean.
what do i care? i've got nobody but those whales...
thank you, janosz.  i've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
forging signatures. telling lies. impersonating practically anybody.
mike. no thanks, i'm fine.
let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
those are canaries, miss.  doesn't this make you feel awful?
i never c-c-carry arms. i'm... a writer.
i've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you, jeremiah. i've just always been too scared to show it.
i don't know exactly.
okay. so maybe you were right.
you don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
forget it. that's past.
fuckin' asshole.
exactly.
or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
when you ran off, i thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in washington.
how's your hand?
over there.  ten o'clock.  he's talking to our little dennis.  dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
go live in a tent.
okay.
who wanted her little girl back?
no.
what's taking you so long about it?
i am not!  i'm a terrible mother! i'm an awful mother.  i yell at him all the time.  i have no patience.  no...no.  he's better off without me.  ted, i've got to go...i've got to go.
herr mozart -
monstrous.
like where?  the 7-eleven on burnside? do you even know my name, screwboy?
happy anniversary.  thank you for making me a part of it.
can't.
what choice did i have -- ?!
and what's that?
that's what he said. jimmy.
that's my bag.
i know.
no, he's not dangerous. not physically.
sure i would--but i don't get what you're driving at.
a mass of music and fire. that's me. an old kazoo and some sparkles. tell me - was bill swept away, too, or were you too full of revelation to notice?
i told this dog i was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
that's better. i say, isn't this where you came in? it's impenetrable, by the way ...
at this size, i would certainly think so.
i don't like it, george...
eddie... it's one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ. it's even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
no one says no to pappy o'daniel.
take this, it'll help you sleep.
well, "admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story i've ever heard.
don't!  stop!
you got that wrong, mister. i am.
about to hang himself, i should think.
some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
now go over there and get those digits.
look.  it's some kind of letter.
why would you wanna do that?
what? did the politburo just one day say - "we give up?"
don't you want to change that?
we are not partners.  between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating i just took, as far as i can tell all partners get you is dead.
god, it's late.  i should find a hotel...
none of that matters now.  the people upstairs need us.  we have to help.
okay, bye.
was i?
what else did padiche say?
how much did you take off?
because he's a bitch.
so how would you put it?
incredible, isn't it? well, i think john has had enough visitors for one day, mothershead. i've got a lecture at the college, i'll be back this evening.
it's dr. furtwängler's baton, which i stole.
no, i want you in.  but being in means you gotta do something.  not just say you're in.
you're a... you're sick.
i just left our friend in miami.
we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways.
ms.  mitchell.  so nice to finally meet you in person.
it looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
but i am barbara. i didn't die.
what?  what?
you bastards, i said twenty!
what's she doing?
it is, thomas, but of good reputation. come, there is no harm in a drink.
i have to talk seriously with you...
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
grimes, you're dead!
that one.
but i love you!
you're late. very late.
do you want me to do it?
that's preposterous --
hello.
stop it!
you stayed there five times in the past six months.  but i didn't have time -- i could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
-- institution.
what are you talking about?
no one ever tells you that...
the wall's transparent...
well, she's running now, too. these fucking people like to run, don't --
we don't know.
something came up in autopsy tonight.  imbedded in beauregard's body we found a claw.
good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
how's the leg?
yeah...i guess.
tv repair?
got any plans?
how'd you do?
it's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
just 'cause i ain't got eyes doesn't mean i can't see.
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
i don't know! she don't look like italian to me. plenny a nice italian girls around.
yeah.
-- well i'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words i just don't use much --
it takes time --
hey -- what's he like?
i wasn't doing business.
what time?
why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
guinan, can i leave the nexus?
yeah.  oh, one more thing. tammy. you know, all this election stuff. 'cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  but that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  i just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. we're still brother and sister.  okay? cause... and i hope you feel the same.
get out.  out!
nothing. i just watch till something strikes me. do anything you think of -- try different thing. until i say, "hold that pose." then just try and comfortably hold it.
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
unsolved bombings in the last year... boston, new york, philadelphia... but no real match
when's it going down?
sure you are.  and we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  getting herself ready for a pioture ...  what happens when she finds out?
terrance and phillip movie?! oy gevalt! not again!
always a pleasure, brucie.
oh.
well, of course, it was horrible. violence is a very horrible thing. that's what you're learning now. your body is learning it.
you start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  we're at a stalemate sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
two of my men deserted last night. it happens from time to time. i assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
i was dead.
i think i've seen this movie before. when i was a kid.  it was on tv.
you mean, we're stranded down here?!
you dumbshit!
i don't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times.
i wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... maybe right here at lisca.
i don't know how to thank you. mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
gestern bein heurigen...
the only place i don't bring my drugs is church. and that ain't till sunday morning.

yeah.
hello lydia?
my prop guy, had a guy out here.
i said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped.
i don't believe this! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell i am!
aren't they all?
don't come any closer.
now for the real question.
yeah. how's dad?
i forgot to thank you for breakfast.
i did?  huh!
:...hearts. and to themselves in these days that try their souls...
what's he smoke in that?
yee-aww.
i need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
do you think i told her to kill you?
yes you are. a guy. guy. quite a guy. oh my. look at that--i rhymed.  yikes.  bikes!
well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
because he's my friend --  and i don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
you joined up.
exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... that's what the public expect from a carl denham picture! lead us into the mountains, sir!
what it is?
kid, get outta the way!!
hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
i think.. i...i realized...i love you.
what?
are you peter venkman?
i'm sergeant sykes, and this is detective jetson, los angeles police department.
i fear he may have to.
what happened to you?
...time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
the whorehouse was my idea. i want betelgeuse out of the picture!  we've got some serious talking to do.
pollux is -- what?
tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
zero.
i can't move!
twelve pack?
there's never any
you're going to live with mr. thatcher from now on, charlie!  you're going to be rich.  your ma figures - that is, er - she and i have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. you'll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to -
lenore, i'm here.  i'm getting out.
mrs. kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
fuck you! if i'm gonna kill myself i'll do it when i'm good and ready! you can go to hell!
yo. i'm gonna get buff dude.
you and maryjane aren't lovers.
i've been thinking about it, that's all.
i don't know.
stag?
that's not going to look too good on your service record.
let's make it more interesting.  i will answer any question you ask. but, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
a computer canna lie, sir.
what's the matter? you ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
that's what i said.
well, it's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. in the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. it's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
i told you, i love other people.
what is it?
but aramis -- !  phillippe can learn in time, but --
dr. singer. it's been a long time.
please, what is it, please --
i -- i don't understand...
they would have killed you -
um, ted, i need a moment with magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
good.  we need you healthy and relaxed. you're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
you know what i mean.  your reputation.

are you crazy?
i said say that again, son - because the next time you do, i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
you mind if i check things back here?
there's not a reason on earth why you should.
delivery entrance.  low security.
you stay out of this!  why, spock? why? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger.
of course it is.  and that's why you should play the part.
we're almost ready. what the hell are you doing out here?
i don't suppose you got any idea where she went?
out of kindness.
yes.
get us some fuck'n back-up now!
my god, what the hell are you...?
"he can't write his name or read a book.  to fool people is his only thought."
everybody needs money. except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. people like that.
the full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
with all due respect, mr. gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
progress!
it's too late for plans.
don't be a fool, everett, we gotta r- u-n-o-f-f-t, but pronto!
restin' in our room. she ain't been feelin' well.
come here.
i just called.
in english, please. i didn't spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
someday, i'll pay it all back.
so, what's your point?
i would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
where did it come from, mama?
you're breaking my concentration!
i'm on the move -
what? how do you know about my father?
those are pretty hostile words.
really, though. my thoughts go haywire sometimes.
...george. i do.  my best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
about me!
huh?
and when the other rabbits hear of fiver's vision, do they believe him?  it could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
well, i don't get it.
i called you sarge.
ned, i swear i knew nothing of this!
and then what, truman?  we'd be back to where we were five years ago.  you're talking like a teenager.
you just don't get it, do you, austin? good night. welcome to the nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
the prospero project was started by my husband. it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. in theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. a 'quick fix'...
maybe it's nice on the other side. them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
merlin, will i live...?  ...i was dreaming...
i guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
no, i mean i can check it for you.
well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
do you know...34 c?  32 c?
chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  but you can bring someone if you like.
same, more of the same. yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. then, instead of watching gilligan, we'd watch captain kirk.
victor!
shut up.  i'm only trying to explain.
you didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
well, c'n we get him back home?
god damn it, clifford, will you shut up! i tell you, i want to give these things! i want to give them to the audience, and i can give them, i will give them, so shut up!
why can't you be my champion?
you were following him night and day. you saw who killed him. you even took pictures of it. it was evelyn mulwray. she's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
what is working around here?
stolen?
fuck lucky. never marry a damn half--mexican.
as the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  remember the crap they taught you in boy scouts.
whatever you touched, that's good now.
who is she daddy?
you catch anything he was saying?
i'm sorry, maybe i better go dorothy.
screw the pem...what about al...
no, no. she said not to call, her husband might answer.
man, i feel like robin leach.  you actually know all these people?
barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   you know what code blue means?
what are we going to do?
when worlds collide.
c’mon, evelyn thompson’s got no class.  she doesn’t marry dr. steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what i can do.
which ones?
now wait, there's been a mix-up. everything's changed...
you said it!
he's got nothing to do with me.
i never killed a priest before.
maybe you'd like to come along and watch, governor? jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.

i always get it twisted because i'm left-handed.
you're here.
take this to ebby in the dugout between innings.
who did that? what the fuck is that?
can i get my life back?
oh, viktor.  you say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  but in the morning, you'd go back to her.  what man wouldn't?
how 'bout me what?
hunh-uh.  check the bread.  he spreads it like the russians are in jersey.
but we just can't leave him in there! what'll happen to him?
why do you hate us so much?
pop, i'm gonna go with mookie.
i'll report it to the driver. about your bag, i mean.
i was always jealous web mimms got to go off and fight with you and cole. now it's my turn.
yah, that is a nice ass.
get out of here!
these scars.  how did you get them?
comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
as a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
they know you were at that meeting, peter.  they've been told, and they know.
so where you go off to, hutton? some expedition in new guinea or outer mongolia?
car wash, captain?
well, i guess you got what you came for.
when the two of you held each other. when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. when your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
you think that's a lot of money?
yes.
you know that sound, oliver?
you ok, bob?
you see, i'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- i'm nervous -- i need somebody -- i don't know if you quite understand me. you said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and i mean --
you got it, sweet pea.  nice boonies, seeger.
how'd you get started?
gorkon's own man??
if you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
alfred, if i've never told you...i just want to say...
yeah.
over sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
is he italian?
you broke your promise.  you talked to her about me.
no!  but how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
this hair.
i haven't seen her in months.
dead, rose is dead? you mean... she died?
what the hell are you doin'?
but the raves about your performance-

is it safe?
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention?
sometimes she's terrific...
you think that's all we busted -- you should see...
uh-huh, i was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then i thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
we cannot go through there....
nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler--can't remember how it turned out..
because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.

he goes to a whorehouse every night?
everything happens once if you live long enough.

my wife? what's she got to do with you?
are you alone in the house?
oh jesus.
stupidity.

i think so.
isn't there a psychological term for that, dr. johnson?
make us a pot of coffee, edna.  it's gonna be a long night. <b> ext. fender compound -- moments later </b> edna stands next to her maimed son near the burning barrels as they watch the winnebago drive off into the desert. locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.

the faa announcement.
ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  i mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. you won't be publishing.  you won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.

very well.
oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney.

mr. spock, rura penthe's deep in klingon territory. if we're discovered...
it's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
 there's nothing in here, sir.  they got away with it.
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
--and your teacher said, "you're too late, truman.  there's nothing left to explore."
yeah, i'd be from belgium too if i was you. you know zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. i mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
why would he go to odessa?
i don't know who we are anymore.
uh-huh.
i don't understand.  not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
oh!  help me! the balloon's going up!
i'm interested in who handled it.
you know what i'm thinking?
i hope i'm not being too forward.
we're being attacked! kill! kill! kill!
nice meeting you.
i'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
what're you -- what?
but what reason could he have? what possible reason?
run a story. say john doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
that's what i'm askin'.
this reunion isn't what i imagined it would be.
otherwise known as an orgy?
are you plumb crazy, man! what do you think happens? we're buried -- that's all.
it's coming along. at the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
what do you need?
t.j., what're you doing?
thank you.
darling, i've been thinking about our little brad problem?  and i think it's time we move to plan b...
fifteen minutes?
yes, sir.
no. no. the guy from downtown.
how stale last night's gaiety looks! it has the taste of a dead cigarette.
what about the world?
please, sir, don't kick my ass! i'll do anything to get out of a beating!
and you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
it's thanksgiving.
lips still for sale?
now that is a happy sound! tomorrow, i want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  the gods know, i'm tired.  come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
-- you stole my cousin enrique's car.
do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
because i got some plans -
damn it! you can’t fucking walk away from this!
you're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. toss me up another.
look, do you want the bed in or not?
you haven't said a word today about that garage. or what i found there.
no. the pill will be for birth control. but girls do like sex. maybe not the first time.
-- if you stop saying things about my zee.
lotte! why aren't you at the pet shop?
it's twelve o'clock.
so far, you have four and i only have two!
winning the war by yourself.
good night, doctor.
why should i respect something which has outlived its purpose?
what you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
what is it?
oh, no!
be a swimmer.
yes what?
what do you know?
what are you doing?
oh, thank you. must have fallen out of my pocket.
here come six more... grid two!
levi, i don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
i'll get eyescanned a dozen times before i get within ten miles of precrime.  they'll pick me up...
you stupid punk!  you came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
what is that?
oh that... it's a flaw in the iris...
well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas, then cut over to...
here. now leave me alone.
california. san berdoo. utah's part of my route. can i ask you a few questions?
you're it.
i'm so glad you're here.
would you be bummed out if i didn't go to chicago with you?
away from here.
how would that person get one if they didn't want one?
i know.
here comes daddy.
mitchell was dead enough.
you remember, john, in '48 -- no one believed alger hiss was a communist. except me.  they loved hiss just like they loved this ellsberg character. east coast, ivy league.  he was their kind.  i was dirt to them.  nothing.
i can't make it.  grace?  grace!?
my firm'll represent you. free of charge.
i mean a day of prayer and fasting. but of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. the country would stop.
got you here.
wha?
give me the film.
then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
you scored with two chicks?!
nothing for a while. you forget, i'm a man of independent means. or fairly independent.
where did you disappear to?
do you want something to drink? a beer? a glass of water?
leo strauss...  i've got to go to boston. i came to say goodbye.
hey!
so, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... is your problem really that you're... lonely?
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now.  my father is an ironmaster.  as was i.
what do you want, kit?
this is fucking crazy.  instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  do you know who frankie flowers is?  he's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  a faggot.  he's killed fucking who knows how many people. you'd need half the force to get close to him.  and you can't get their help because he lives in fucking san diego.
officer taylor, how are you this evening?
beth, the message said harry.  "my name is harry".  my name isn't harry.
oh.
very well, plainly and distinctly. although i consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as i, what i am about to say.  lloyd may leave karen, but he will not leave karen for you.
this door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
i'm sorry.
the thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. the other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. and that's what it is with you dad. i'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
we ain't taking him to a hospital.
mr. rielly? my name is mark kincaid. i'm with the l.a.p.d. are you aware	of last night's events?
i don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
uh... sure... come in.
ok. definitely not cool! definitely inappropriate behavior here.
change? what's wrong with what i got on?
is that what you were trained to do?
tsch, a few.
how far?
does she sleep here? ever?
my raincoat's in the back.  put it on.
i mean you don't have to say nice things to me... that kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
she grew up.
"raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
so what if we just did it...today. pack up.  drive straight down to bixby.  get serious.
because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil sunny.
hello, jean-pierre.
hello, data...
what?! what are you doin'?
i could hang myself.
my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
can't hurt?  i had to get him back his job.
there's a lot of carbon scoring here. it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
love ya.
that book is out of print, karen, those days are gone. fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
how long since you were here?
i kinda get nervous when i take tests.
they're not home yet.
where has all our beer gone?
anyway, you remember harold?
manson beat you.
ya right --  mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
do you know where fuse box is?
patients have visitors, not doctors.
here are the keys to my apartment. i'm going to park you in my place while i take carol home.
i've noticed... do you understand what they're saying?
a name. grunemann. nothing. and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. then they asked me, well had i been getting letters, from someone out there in cabbageville --
you know this?
chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
what's that?  i hear something!
you tell me!! let me see that wallet.  jeffrey beaumont. what're you doing in my apartment, jeffrey beaumont?
well, come on, gal, i got you a room.  you can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
he's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him.
jesus, you scared me. what are you doing here?
great.  terrific.  glad you could make it.
congratulations, field agent kensington!
people will talk.
uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard enterprise with my officers as guests of the united federation of planets?
bulishit!  you're fucking with my head!
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
here you are, sugar.
what i mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if i came back... do you think you could forgive me?
grand champion, is it?  and what great cause leads you to me?
we'll get those english pigs tomorrow.
you're not very ambitious, are you?
well, well, well. huh?
then --
there's this poem by rilke, i don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  about waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  and the last line of it goes, "who knows?  perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
how much do i owe you?
would you rather i not smoke?
boy, i'm blind as a bat!  you got a match?  i'm going to break my neck in here.  where are you?
he's gone.  he told me what happened.  he just left for the airport.
is that it, bruce?  i'm under some magic spell?
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
i'll have lunch ready by one.
we're close to your headquarters. go home and check in.
my lord.
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by creed, a master of fist-men.
i shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
well, then?
what the hell are you doing here?
a cowboy. you're going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy. have you thought this entirely through?
l.a. is in a constant state of warfare. gangs fighting for the right to rule.
[because he's outside. because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.
jesus... they've probably got five bucks between them. turn around.
my god... so it's as i always feared. nothing, leading to nothing.
not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
why?
let's talk about this later.  right now we have other things to settle. you and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to ostia.  from there, caesar has decreed you be given an estate in paestum.  it's beautiful; an old greek town right on the ocean.  rich soil.  perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
ask him.
good evening, odette, who is sick this time?
a man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
and you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
put your shoulders back.
what's he doing out there?
so what do you want?... an autograph.
no.
oh, sure. now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. you were completely innocent -
i want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  i don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
1972 pontiac lebaron.
we've got another one.
your ex-wife.
and then you left him? he lost weight there and you left him?
could have happened to anybody.
gotta be honest, i love what you've done with the place --
the ship is sailing wihout us!
i'll send you straight to hell, fuck!
how much is it?
i was, uh, one of the authors of the port huron statement.--the original port huron statement.
and what did they say about me?
mr. keating!
please be quiet -- oh please, pearl!
then i'm doing fine.
nah, she would never...
she's left the room before. she always came back.
well, let's see, we've got double a's --
as it pertains to you -- not me.  did you always know you had different... tastes?
me too. there's this poem --
you wife's made for this business. she know how to drive a hard bargain.
i think it's closed.
you really wear that suit.
yes, what is it? you're interrupting my moment of triumph.
how did you know they were stockings?
to put it simply, i should say that our general belief was in moderation. we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
no -- no -- not yet. well, i mustn't let it interfere with my duty. any news here?
how? did they figure it out after i died?
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. why here?
i don't want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
you kill me, you really do.  the first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
women.
what's wrong with him?
you know, i was the one who created hell.
just a minute, i better make sure.
who?
that's really what i came here for. see what you guys recommend.
keaton, we gotta go. they're gonna find him.
jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
i don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
i'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
i'll never marry you.
maybe martha moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
you think you could explain all this to me?
"frenzy".
you really like that shirt?
i don't know how i could've missed you with that shirt on. it's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. right?
you fucking bastard...
nonsense.  what next?
i ain't that dumb, mama. sailor and i been on a crime spree? knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? ain't you read about it?
what's that?
you'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. mcdermott is the biggest asshole. van patten is the yes man. price is the most wired. i'm the best looking. we all have light tans. right now i'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and van patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
where are you, mulder?
i hope it's not the oven again.
hi, leonard.
this is from tony for the rainout. c'mon, man, let's go to the party.
i'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. any suggestions?
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth, nineteen seventy...
what did you say his name was?
oh, baby. what a bad boy you are!
really, i'm impressed.
emily.  just kidding.
but he's dead.
they're afraid of our light. that means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you?
down to my car.
thank you.
little place called "williams," why?
keep it.
go even crazier?
float me a hundred bucks.
have any trouble getting here?
he's no more an indian than i am though. anyhow, doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. just like he does to frank and me sometimes. you just ignore it. or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. he's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. i guarantee it.
light. at the end of a long, dark tunnel. somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
you'll miss the battle of the century!
...no.
joanna bourne. so rich and crisp. this woman lets you touch her body? you put your hands on her personal parts?
a visit from an old friend.
now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
you <u>are</u> kareem. i've seen you play. my dad's got season tickets!
where's the old lady?
didn't i tell ya not to worry?  vic was worried.
why, sure. it won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
so am i.
'i've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'

christ... i can't believe it... invisible ink?
...no...i don't hate you.  do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, jimmy?
is that your blood?
so go dance.
been here long?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
joe --
that's an affirmative.
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
yes, of course, your brother is a problem. it was to be expected.
i don't know, booth.
what about us?  are we to wait forever?  is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it.
they don't suspect <i>him</i>?
"this is gale gayley for channel four news!"  incredible. unbelievable!  for bernie laplante! he's a celebrity now?  'cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
the whole town's in an uproar. we've got to find him. the letter's our only clue.
yeah, your little cootchie knew.
you know what, kid? i think maybe you're a hustler.
for murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
hey...  i can't control it.  it's just, something that happened.
it took you long enough to get my ass out.
cut the horseplay, harry. what's the matter with you guys?
i want you back, fran.
mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. the transporter beam is non-operational. captain, we've received important orders from starlet command.
yes it's me!!! frank is on his way up to dorothy's apartment.  oh no. frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  detective williams. hurry. i'm in the apartment. hurry. i'm hiding in the back bedroom.
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something.
hey...
when you were gone last year -- where were you?
[no. whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
it makes it all seem so serious.
if the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  they'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.

[yeah.  yes.]
should i?
what happened? were you kicked out?
oh yes, he's pretty good.
i think nothing happens. you're dead meat. that's it.
i'm a bargain.
just so you know, i've overridden the vehicle locator.  i just wanted to talk to you before justice --
huh? that's smart!
i was hoping to get some understanding from you. and i'm not getting it.
i dunno... i always feel like everybody secretly hates me. i'm just paranoid i guess. i mean, you like me don't you? we're good friends, right?
that's okay.
open and shut?  <u>open and fucking shut</u>?
why, yes. this is amazing.
porters?
it'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
yes.
can i have this room daddy?
is harvard gettin' all that money?
well, nobody put a gun to his head.
stacy...stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the i-told-you-so speech.
that's it?  good...i thought you'd break out the champagne....
can you set that up?
so i can have these?

no, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about estelle. his wife still lives in fayettesville. she's... disturbed.
he's satan hiding behind the cross!
i won't screw you up.
james... i can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  congratulations, and i really mean it.
you grew up around here?
jessica.
we're growing very concerned back here. there's no use pretending otherwise. we're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' people are beginning to ask difficult questions.
here, put this in his mouth.
well... if you're sure that i could accomplish everything in a week... i suppose i could manage it.
why didn't you support her? you're the worst of the lot.
the scotsman's daughters are at the poltroon's house. a company of the 33rd will accompany you and magua will show you the way.
how <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
i don't know.  i'm so scared. help me.
don't we?
why?
here with you.
it's a difficult situation, and i want you to know i appreciate it. tonight's going to be real tough for me --
it's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? what's happened here?  come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
hostages?
ships that pass in the night...
ma, do you know where ray is? i've been calling him and i'm getting his machine and --
what about it?
if the documents section can't do it... i'll send it up to langley...
goodnight.
he did.
you never did like being called that, did you?
right, that synchronizes here. okay, bomb, arm yourself.
what is it, gordon?
it's no joke.  i'm responsible for what happens, you know.  embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  i have to put down a deposit for the room.  i have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
how much did you pay?
no?
are you a good cop, john?
how do you eknow.
what was that? oh man, you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard.
yes.
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
you don't look nothin' like me, mister.
you got a real friend here, kid. don't forget it.
well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  you wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
yes, admiral. but that may not be possible.
you're speaking of emotional investment?
i'm going back there.
when you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  my parents were waiting up for me. as soon as i got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  i was so upset... i told them i slept with you.  my mothers slapped me.  that was the first time she'd ever hit me.  i couldn't believe it.  i ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as i could run. i was crying.  they had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and i wanted to punish them for that.  i decided to hide out all night.  they'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  the woods were cold and damp from the rain.  i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep.  all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree. but the footsteps just stopped. the woods were dark.  i couldn't see anything.  i heard a cracking noise behind me.  i turned around and... and... oh, god... there was this hideous looking man.  so grotesque he was almost inhuman.  he had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  i was so hysterical and i don't know how i was able to get away.  i ran and ran, but he kept coming.  he was big but so fast.  he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. i was screaming, but who could hear me?  then... oh, god... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  i was kicking and yelling.  he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  oh, please... please...
i want to talk to them first. i know more now about ordell's money.
they've never been separated before.
just tell me about the intended victim.  this anne lively...
i don't know, the screens are dead...!
no!  look, i don't belong here!  what i need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
hi, our lot!
yes, joe, yes--right away. 
we had a slight burglary last night.
yeah.
save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
you will keep in touch.
all the same, someday you'll lie to laszlo. you'll be there.
i say we don't call it in.  under no circumstance are we to call this in.

mainly i work out of boston.
we also need a fucking money counter, william! we have to get the money out by thursday and i'll be buggered if i am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
finish him, finish him. your way.
it's a good job.
so, it's from the future, is that right?
this is one-way street.  you go down the block to the middle.
i've got to make a stop in vegas, then i'm heading to santa barbara.
how long?
but you can't.  we must escape.
i'm sorry. forgive me.
space for what?  to o.d. like that other kid?  i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  because it isn't.  correct?
three whips. to go.
i'm not fifteen.

who said that?
i'm working on it.
you still together?  going all right?
i'm not a half bad cook.
yeah?
yes?
what do you mean, they take out her butt?
you don't either. take a look at yourself. maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
she's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
he's okay, clair.  you wanna give him a little room?
we're not doing anything wrong, do you.
i'd suggest a telegram.  something like this: chief of police, san francisco.  a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  his partner, name something-something greer, refuses to give us any information. correction.  refuses information necessary to our investigation. can you assist?  signed detective sergeant driscoll, vancouver, british columbia, police. 
fine.  i was making time with your girl.  now i'm all scared, and i'll never make that mistake again.  now go away.
just wait there for me!
what do you mean we.
what about your twelve brothers?
is that how you feel?
i'm gonna try and get us across the border.
oh jesus...
that's because you were taken in by that verdampter allied propaganda. such filthy lies.  but nobody said a bad vord about winston churchill, did they?  oh no, vin vit vinnie!  churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. couldn't even say nazi.  he would say narzis, narzis.  ve vere not narzies, ve vere nazis.  but let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, hitler vas better looking than churchill, he vas a better dresser than churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off churchill!
ed! how did you know i was here?
i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds.
here, i'll take it. it's my job.
i'm too old for you. besides, i'm not much in the mood.
mr. van orton... ?
a narcissist doesn't admit it.  it's the extreme of self-denial.
this is show business?
what? what? what now?
you know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... it would be nice if you acted like you understood.
how?
and a slice of pecan pie, right?
what do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
there's a rifle and a shotgun here.
yeah, but -
yah.
...i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something.
why won't you come with me? what are you so scared of?
how many languages do you speak?
promise??
very big beads.
damone, you gotta listen to me.
wait, this isn't the way.  who are you?
...it's really a fine opportunity for me. but i'm not sure i want to be a department head. it's mostly executive and administrative work. well, anyway, i told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
when?
i... accept your proposal!
finish what you started.  you haven't changed, chuck.  it's still you.
is it a charge, sir?
no, sir.
such a sad face... you know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
claudette...
can i just ask you one other thing?
it is why krishna brought you here.
but the good witch of the north told me not to.
back to copacabana. but eve. margo, let me tell you about eve-
i had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
really?
hello again.
yeah?
hi.
i'll be back home around three. if you're back by then we can watch tv or something... i guess what i'm saying is... that i hope you are back when i get home. please be careful.
yeah, a fall.
you want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- what do you think!  what do i have to do? draw you a picture?
i'm marrying debbie.
i got my wish anyway.
turn it up, magda.
you have to understand, in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. it didn't matter.
harry -- i'm blind!
no. don't worry, i'm a cop. everything'll be okay. is he still breathing?
give it back!
aren't you going out with catherine?  i'm sorry. it's none of my business. i didn't mean...
over.
hey!
i must say, you look remarkably good.  you don't want a book then?
you made it! hey, that looks great on you. 's classy...  so, how'd it go today? you find him?
what?
let it go, don't waste your time.
leave me alone!
i felt like she almost killed me.
then the emperor has already won. you were our only hope.
we want mrs. peel.
like, that there's a point? an organic connection between all living things.
not it at all, really.
whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
he's at -
how are you, benjamin?
hey, where'd this come from?
what do you want it to be?  vivian, my name's vivian.
i got in early. i was excited...  who was that guy?
will you be here?
are we supposed to be up here? the rules said...
i'm luke starkiller, guardian of the bendu.
claire.
oh, great.
that was cold...
joe, i can't look at you any more.
they were very upset.
pardon me... my mistake.  taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
would you do it just because you're my friend? my very best friend.
ready for hard work, son?
he'll be atop the portculis ere long.
daddy?
yes.
did you find the disks?
be one with the horse.
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy, i hardly see how i am to--
thanks for telling me.
what are you saying?  that i'm seeing what i want to see?  that i'm protecting a murderer?  what?
the men said, nine.
just plain 'joe'?
that don't smell like a more.
what's the matter?
i detest violence, but ... christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
you blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  i'd be pissed off too if i was her.
they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
who knew about agnes' pregnancy?
my guests were shredded. it's your sick little scene now, steven: enjoy. i'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then i'm calling a cab.
fifteen years in el paso.
oh -- sunday is good for me to meet your folks. we get a big family audience on sundays so it works out.
five o'clock.  killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut.
i want you to let me go.
know what you mean, blair.  trust is a tough thing to come by these days. just trust in the lord.
counselor, you're insulting me.
depends.
no - i don't want it, thank you.
ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? gill told me. told me how you and he... you and everybody...
i can’t stay.
man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
<i></i> i beg your pardon?
you're a little touchy about it.
now.
maybe i can do something right.
henry finch.  that they monitor everything.  that it was only a matter of time.  and now four people are dead.
how come you took your own car?
i thought he was a kind, gentle man?
i'm sorry. this thing has just knocked me silly.  how long do we have to wait for this police character?
do you know hans hinkel?
good night, mike.
no, but i will lock you in.
the same thing i wanted ten years ago - all the romonovs dead i got the others, now i have to finish up with that nuisance, anastasia...
well, i'm stuck with two and two—but i'm a sucker if i can make four out of it.  where do you come in?
well, then, doctor macfarlane -- although i've known a time, toddy, when you liked the name.  aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  but come toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
uh... i'm father mcfeely
i beat the odds!
thank you.
what's going on?
no way.
i'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  all right arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
what is that smile on your face?  is there anything wrong with me?
how i usually find you, nyah.
a pretty day's work of it you have made, master roderick.  knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. he takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
ashamed? no -- i love you, lynette. i mean that. after i leave them, i'll meet you at the motel, okay?
what the hell would you call this?
throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? how good are the warrants?
oh, cut my finger.
but have you ever seen it? think back...
it's a very moving experience, trust me.
uh, well, anyway, so i'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. i wrote to derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. but everything's still kind of in development at this point.
not that far, only halfway.  you sure you know what you're doing?
hello.
i don't deserve haagen daz.  i'm a horrible person.
well, sir, i'm an excellent filer.
you'd love to prove that. getting your name in the national geographic.
we already made the same offer to the stockholders.
a meteorite, dad, look!
she'll be twelve next week. we're throwing a big party on saturday. wish i could ask you to come...
leave him alone, lennon, or i'll tell them all the truth about you.
what?
snap out of it!
i'm not sure he's a lunatic.
you prefer nights?
is norbert still here?
i think he's got a terrific personality.
hey, tricks. some detail they got you on.
i do not want your power. it is hideous.
what?  what are you talking about?
how much we going after?
also -- there was nothing in your report about <u>why</u> you're here.
why would i give a shit how you feel. and i got news for you. i loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... i'm toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident.
i am happy to hear you say this, chairman mao. i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax, and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay.
hello?
jesus...
i...i don't know...
okay!  okay, fuck it!  use the basement!  get off me!
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan. the danvers have been arrested!
i was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
what's that? what's that? take it away - take it away - take it away! 
what day?
i just glances inside.
sir, we are negroes. all except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
who is this?
we've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving east.
what an asshole.
and you said there'd be some of me left.  nobody's going to know me in this getup.
thank you.
fight a bit of a cold..
i am sorry, madame, but no! i cannot let anyone pass.
your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
no kiddin', bennie. i got gas.
why?
what're you doing?
you are wonderful!
listen to me.  is there a gas station nearby?
well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? how many, approximately?
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
frankly, carl, i can't see giving much more. if you have any suggestions i'll be glad to listen.
men, they mostly faggots.
meaning?
well, mr. kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to moscow.
everybody needs it.  ask prudential.  or allstate.
i know you'll whip her into shape, scotty. you always do.
i'm so proud of you, bud.
interesting suit.
lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  charles, we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
first thing that comes to your mind?
godless buffoons, all of them.
i won't be that long.
hey, dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
no, by road?
getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie? dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? that ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. when you've got a map to new york city, you get back to me.
you could have knocked me down with a feather -- selectman -- me.
now you're going to do just what i tell you to.  no discussion.  no hesitation.
my wife and i think so, but we're family. your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. what do you do, pick or sing?
what?
how come you don't took familiar?
it's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
where am i at, man?
yah, okay, i'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
directing suits you.
what?
elaine.
well, you can tell them i said they're right.  i better get going. roy'll wonder where i am.
why didn't you eat last night?
eleven.
what if i were to say "you're fired?"
i ought to get some sleep.
do you have money?
someday, dick.
what, lady disdain? are you yet breathing?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions.
excuse me?
do you know what c.p. time is?
tired?
brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
but dr. evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. a few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
it could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
but you said she was a sparkplug...?
look at his face... and his hair...  is that what it is to grow old?
what'd you find out?
you'll have a corpse on your hands! that what you'll have. i won't eat a thing while i'm on this boat.
me? i could never go to a place like that.
not...gray.
the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi. the quartet was in my file, along with every other thing i had done since high school, see? aliases, middle- men. they knew me better than i did. they knew all of us.
you've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
what time's this party tonight?
in jenny?  'course not.  how could i be. 'course i wasn't.
but i do miss that green sport coat of yours.
well then, why am i seeing all these strange things?
yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
so far, they do. but, the quantity, it does not exist. you will have to re-evaluate your needs.
where is it?
jack.  i said the kids are asleep...
what do you mean?
yeah baby.
no gas.
and you said...?
it's the same thing!
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. i would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- jimmy michaels.
wife?
first decent idea you've had in a month.
would you like something to drink?
where did your brother escape from?
expecting visitors?
that is my destiny. i have a destiny, too...
they' re dead.
valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. is that normal?
i only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
in a sense, that's all he knew. the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
it's your choice.  because it's not safe for you to be awake.  to be walking around.  to be thinking about things.
i don't know, i don't know, i just know it.
sorry about what happened at the dresden. i had no idea...
why special?
there doesn't seem to be any water damage. kind of cozy, actually.
show me.
i tell you, joe, they're on to us.  they're going to line us up against the wall and -  eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - i tell you, joe, i'm just going to die of shame.
you upset with me?
do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
i know, but we're on a college campus...
fifty percent.
okay, i wrote those things... and yeah, i had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, i saw who she was. i'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
we've lost sen!
i'm not kiddin'. where were you? who were you with?
i think we should. it's not fair to let him suffer. he's not much use anymore. he'd hate living like that.
stan? what's going on?
i didn't say it like that.
the president is about to speak. i don't think it's going to be good news.
sure i know where he lives. he lives in bailey park.
we're fucked.
he's not as tough as he'd like to think.
i forgot where i put my keys.
they bombed us, we're off the air.
somebody couldn't wait until dark.
yes...i guess so. he was sleeping on the front porch when i left.
what kind of car was it?
sure. you boys want anything?
both you, idiots shut up, i can't understand shit! now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
take it easy now. don't rush it.
yes...
some party.
guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
cheerleading.  for... sporting events, yes?
i thought they'd be in coffins.
just banged my head.  it was an accident.
tell me something, jack, how much longer you in here?
one way.
what do you want?  this is a private area!  get lost!
i want them arrested and hanged!
what.
those solar winds are flaring, but i factored them into my coordinates and --
just one moment, sir.
holly.
you keep running that mouth i'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
exactly!  so i dug it, and i did a lot of research.
-- price killed her, there's no other explanation --
ann, do you see a pattern here?
that bastard. i didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
in what capacity?
rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. if you're going to talk nonsense, i don't want to talk to you at all. rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
but there may be a few around somewhere.
well there's something new.
how old is he?
no.
yes.
holy shit cartman!  what was that?!
so, it's worth the wait, right? what can i do?  rent a huey?  have an airlift?  it's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  how many peasants would that take?  a line stretching from here to mexico city --
don't fuck with us!  where did you go!
but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse, for a rainy day.
hi.
hi, how are you?
we're only going to get one shot at this. target their primary reactor. with any luck, their warp core should implode.
no!  i keep seeing him staring out his window. watching me.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
you still have an aversion to the water?
carter, would i lie to you?
are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
did you hear what i just said?!
forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
come on, i'll drive you in this thing.
any sign of harry?
i am no one's wife.  i live in my own house.  i do not live in a man's house.  he has a wife.  we are together.  i am free.  because of banking and finance and travel...  and i can do anything i want...
my monsters?
believe it.
if junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
lobotomy!
you want us to give you a ride?
not much, actually. my software company just went public so i'm just... hanging out, really.
christ, tripp. how did you know?
what frequency ?
what do you do over at your bank, grant?
i'm gonna break your fucking head! you fucking jerkoff!
so i'm making it concrete.
little sister, i don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. i want you to rest... for a while anyway.
it's done?
no... there's a couple of things i'm still working on.
no.
i saw your...cat.
sure. i can follow that.
she's dead.  the dead ought to be buried.
oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
would of been nice.
a book of delusions.  anything else?
right now we have to be practical.
how did you survive?
thank you, sir.
i know.
no sir -- this is where joel lives.
... if i may quote the twentieth century poet  - joe piscahpo:  you look marvelous...
oh, his maid!... stupid me, i thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
don't be pissed. i'm on your side, pard. i just don't want you to do something you'll regret. you gotta give six years to the navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes god put on this earth. officers aren't like you and me, man. it's another breed.
wait! you said you'd let me go!
you want me to ride down with you?
are you having me on?
that was easy, wasn't it?
what -- what are you doing?
i'm glad you agreed to see me.
you care about him, don't you?
mind if i play some tunes?
no you're gonna shoot me don't shoot -
who's now vanished.
time is running out.
do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
can i do it? i just broke her cherry. i imagine i can make her do anything. bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
let's take it down a notch.
hi, gale, any leads?
how will i know?
bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
by the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
so where's the harm?
take the money and walk away!
are these yours?
what are you doing?
you're making me very angry.
a factor of age.
i want to tell eve.
where're you going?
you knew there were guns in here!
so do we, lady.
how's every little thing?
the thing is, cameron -- i'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  my sister.  i can't date until she does.
he's a killer, brian... he's fucking insane.
you know what i think we need? martinis. how about martinis to celebrate?
yes.
hey, you know better than that.  what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
are you staying with a friend, sir?
not long ago...
we're out two minutes, me and dreyer.
i think i need a little air.
i think it's really a wonderful piece, margaret!
hey.  this is looking good!  paul, where's the octopus motor?
no. i don't mean that. i just meant in general.
she from scotland too?
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, enemy lines. 
i don't see how i can. and i can't prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what i'm doing, but you can make some money.
what the fuck does vietnam have to do with anything!  what the fuck were you talking about?!
mr. jefferson carver?
look at this.
... it was like... the minute i saw her... i knew.  she looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
right.  but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed... but not big billy.  he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  it came to the end of the game.  it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
how'd you get up here?
and i think they just came back from masters and johnson.
based in london, but with international concerns.
yeah, he's funny that way.
i want to be baptized.
you vouch for him?
isn't that the point?
what was it?
you told me he was dead.
why does it all mean so much to you? all the time, 'land, land, land.'
oh, charlie.
it doesn't protect your head, though.
it reminded me of you, so i bought it. it cost me more than all the others.
don't worry. i get it.
yeah, what is it?
well, it worries me.  i want you to get swept away.  i want you to levitate.  i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
that was because of... the reputation the gang had.
it's not mine.
you just come in on amtrack?
son of a bitch!
c-span?
it's a perfectly good car. it runs.
and it's proving quite effective...
or a beer.  i've got some in.
so you're testing <u>me</u> now?
the booze.
at last!   a call!  a cry of distress ...  concorde!  brave, concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
i'm sure it is.  it's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  more than likely he never even watched it.
so i asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. it's like the "bagger" system. you know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. or a three-bagger...
accept a compliment.
get away from there, convict!
what are watchin' this junk for?
i am the borg.
me fall? let's get some drugs!
do i make you horny?
she's not responding...
really.  what'll i pin this on?
'cause i wanna watch the knicks on television.
a nice, big cock.
we can't just sit here.  we've got to start moving, so pick.
no, johnnie.  no goddamned phones. not now.
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
calm down everybody.   we're just here to negotiate general sarris' surrender.
fuck you!
you're drunker than i thought.  are you doing that again?
eddie.
um...i'm pretty sure i'm bruce wayne. and you are?
well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
that's right.
neither is acting. not if you're serious about it.  can i have one of these?
i got that beat.  so like, last may, i was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in pennsylvania. there was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
there was no sex.  she was very traditional.  we were waiting until we were married.
yes, sir?
yeah well, they want a lot for their money. they want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." we've got to give them something. they'll kill me if i don't. and the panthers are going to kill me if i do. i'm scared.
she has no idea who i am.
frances.
what's your problem with crippled dick?
give me a list of those effects. i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
what do you mean "don't worry?"
you thought any more about our murder?
are you sure?
this isn't the time --
never heard of him. 
you got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
plastics.
all right, i'll see you!
why did you say those things?
that would be jack goodman, the boy who was killed.
you haven't got the authority.  only pendergast can pull the plug.
you remember the sounds they made?
hello, gabriel.
what do you want of me?  i'll give you anything you want, but do what i ask!
he's gone. he stole the car.
so who's the lucky guy?
i have to go.
well, it's the jack kennedy syndrome, huh?  you die young, you always look golden.  perfect.  the memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
not exactly a lightweight.
sure thing.
nudie pictures, what do you think?
yes, it's so nice i thought i'd work outside.
please, francie...
we can't just sit here, austin.
do you have any particular choice of girl?
sorry.  i don't know anything about it.
i'm sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
so... how'd you hear about this?
christ!
what we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
i missed you. i know i'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
it's terribly good.
know where i can find her?
what's happened to -- how are you doing that?
hell no, i'm not into that shit. the sight of blood makes me sick.
for chrissakes.  you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
well, you know... what do i know about clothes... i've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
what's the matter here?
listen to me good, evan...
no.
what do you mean?
so long.
neat, yeah.
... bottle ...
i embroidered.
who are these people?
have you come from my brother?
where's shorty?
she married some english prick.
i guess at this point i'm what the french call 'de trop'...
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas?
yeah. i'm going home today.    what do you want, frankie?
i go home and paint the kitchen.
listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
you got that right.
when?
i'm afraid the rest of ward's island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, the charnier shipping company, of marseilles, france.
mr. lundegaard?
hide out for what? we ain't doin' nothin'.
you seem a decent fellow. i hate to kill you.
do you think i ever could've been in the running?
<u>i</u> dunno.... ambassador to <u>togo</u>, somethin', <u>i</u> dunno... he...
oh my god...
dr. niko topopolosis?
madam grusinskaya -- at once --
and you're sure it was a woman?
well, yes...
if you get it?
come on, fellah -- speak up!
well you've gotta be prepared.
i called a fellow i know in tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. there's a sucker there he says is made for us. and a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! now, i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. we could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
you gotta be kidding? what the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
are you sure?
4:25.
maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
last i heard you were offered a posi- tion in the west somewhere. tuscon was it?
i predict we're lost.
what do you want?
i can't leave now.  don't ask me to explain!  i just can't!
no! that's not terrance or phillip!
the truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
let's just say, i never saw e.t.
are you sure this is okay?
wanna drink?
the police? they know less than you do.
god damnit! will you stop doing that?!
shortie!--you know my motto?
whose word?
i'm going to win this case... mist... mr. doneghy... i'm going to the jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and i'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
uh, victor, i hope i haven't done something to make you think...
i didn't know what else to call you.
it's not really that big i got it on kind of a stand...
you should be. can i meet this friend of yours?
what?
no leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. i'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. you're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
i heard he was the best.
what are you doing?
no hurt jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
we are lost.
five-thousand per kilo.
mixed salad.
hey.
he just asked me questions.
there's my dad with joanie.
to the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
someone lost the key.
sure.  you think there's a connection?
i'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
i demand to know what is going on...
so everyone is serenely happy in shangri-la? nobody would ever think of leaving?  it's all just so much rot! she's pleaded with me ever since i came here to take her away from this awful place. she's cried in my arms for hours, for fear i'd leave her behind. and what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
you're not so old yourself!
i've got goose-bumps all over me.
take your time.
i didn't cook up a story.  i had a source.
the precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
not if they're looking at something else.
hi.  just checking to see if you're here.
sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  i saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "love child."  it's fuckin' outa control.  values've gone to hell, jim... course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house.
holy shit.
we are awesome monster-bashers!
sorry.  schneider id it to me again.
you think sandmen will?  there's no other way for me,
calm down, my lord, i beg you!
what business meeting?
think about what i said.  i mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
then make your choice.
yeah...so...you've got this sort of... bobby mcferrin thing going there.
how'd you know my name was rudy.
but you don't understand!  i'm a man!
maybe i want to die. don't you want me to die?
steal it? naw, i didn't steal it.
that's enough, edie.
how can i help?
what if your life depended on it?
hello regan. i'm a friend of your mother, i'd like to help you.
the law's on our side. if they want to challenge it, let them try.
good.  there.  yes?
it will be.
are you going to walk all the way?
lemme fix you a drink.
now here's what's goin' down. listen, 'cause i'm gonna say this but one time. on january first, the first day of the bicentennial i'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? a snow-white underdog. an' i'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? an' i'll tell you why, 'cause i'm sentimental -- an' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, apollo creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. now that's the way i see it an' that's the way i want it!!
leave. go.
what?
it's all right -- i don't think tex does, either.
...i thought you were dead. going home?
pry the thing open?  what are we -- neanderthals?
this may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
who the hell ever is.  this is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. these bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
we've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
what is it?
fire, or clear out, ice.
trust me.  call that number.
rae, all we got is each other.
it wasn't my fault. i was just part of a team. i was doing my job...
you put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
this is where my journey started... right here.
you've seen the post-its.  i've already got more juicy material than i need. why should i pay you dollar one?
a horse?
"death and taxes"?
no, i think you were.  come on, admit it.
no, no, c'mon jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
you did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
... 'cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. so then i wouldn't even try.
i try to moisturize regularly.
and what are you going to do?
you wouldn't ever hurt mummy and me, would you?
probably as small as mandrake falls.
hello?
whenever he played radio city, who do you think was right there in the front row?
i thought you might write again. now that we're brothers...
because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
well, don't they?
i just came from a meeting... i can't talk about it now, baby. but in a few days -- see i'm disgusted with my life.
we record and document it. we're gonna make history, dwight. the first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. the book sales alone will be worth millions. i'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. now, what time is orientation?
you sell it.
no.
what?!
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born. before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... i made a very beautiful statue. even if i had not met with this disaster, i could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. and, my child, you are that figure come to life. i wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
what is it all about?
you're really crazy.
what's a'matter?
you're probably right.
but it was all we had.
maybe we shouldn't fight at all. fighting is pretty immature.
...or maybe i just haven't played 'em right, i don't know. but you're--
no, i'm not going to stop it. hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
we back in metropolis?
why do it?
everybody that she plays with dies.
guilt?
no, no, no. i have to talk to him. if i can only call him...
there was a prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills. am i that prince? hana laughs.
when i was a naive young recruit in spain, i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  i now understand: it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  to our women.
i'm getting a chest cold..
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  i miss rorschach.  let's spring him.
yeah, downtown.
and look at this, peter  cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
oh, yes, it's already made up.  our mr. mervin wrote a small review.
hey.
nothing.
hey there.  i was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  you don't look so good.
why all the way to del rio?
depends on the quote. let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
what's his line?
no!  tis not the time!  i want no part of your frolic.
what about you coming down here...?
great.  gotta go.  see you then.
my pocket.  check my pocket, will ya, honey?
i can't.
oh, wonderful.  my secret weapon is - pms.  that's just great.  thanks for telling me.
maybe he'll get back to work.
yeah, we were goin' over everything. that's why all the bags.
you guys got something going on downstairs?
you like that?
you must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
yeah, maybe r.j. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. my sentry markers are placed. i'm heading back to the base.
i suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
hold this.
long live the first amendment.
i can't....i can't....
oh, they frighten me, i'm afraid i'll drop them. they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. i was dropped on my head, that's why i don't understand things.
milo. what's up?
but you think about him -- it -- her.
mom... what are you wearing?
yes.
you gotta tell a story too, brian. it's fair. c'mon, don't think too hard --
he totally freaked.  i've never seen him like this.  he's out of his fucking mind.
why, yes, technically. jack kerouac and i came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, i think...
i haven't slept in weeks.
then why ain't he dead?
tell ya bri., i'm still a little sleepy,... think adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
she gotta be kiddin', right? vaporize the whole damn planet--?
say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
sounds boring.
hi, chief.  you like the suicide?
technically.  they're separated.
come again... ?
buffy, i'm gonna tell jeffrey you were playing with another man's hebrew national.
you can't come up here!
she said it was up to me. if i don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
i'm sorry - - i'm sorry - -
i know she's coming back.
you jivin' me?
... no.
you just put mustard on your hershey bar.
stop screaming, mollie or we're sunk. i'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
for the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
and you saw a shape ahead of you...
i've missed you.
call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. jane mckenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. i've been after it a long time.
yeah, they're confused.  they can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
you and the other one, you're still billy's girls. you always were his girls...
ollie.
you killed them.
what are you all, blind?  it's a shark.  look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
who's your partner?
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year.
if you tell me where the leads are, i won't turn you in.  if you don't, i am going to tell the cop you stole them, mitch and murray will see that you go to jail.  believe me they will.  now, what did you do with the leads?  i'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
[do you know who i am? i am the commandante of the judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
just remember two things.  first, the law is a living thing.  it made us free and it keeps us free. sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  but in the end, the law prevails for the just. sometimes, it takes a while.
mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. she's embarrassed to tell me. so why don't you tell me?
no rest for the wicked.
i could make her another cleopatra...
stop it.
you have to let me go!
what's the difference? it's all mental masturbation.
but he didn't! i've looked everywhere --  and if i don't find it --  those men going to kill me.
...now that's aggravating.
good christ!  can't you lose these jokers?
are we all museum bigots in maine?
and bears!
we've had thefts of our new stuff ...gruner deals in this... a big deal is going down now. i went to see if gruner had anything to sell. but he didn't make any moves...and when you arrived, he backed off.
leseure. but i went to high school in white bear lake.
where's yours?
i'll tell you this.  after cleveland, i thought i was lucky to be alive.  but now, here, i just realized that you were the lucky one.
came to my senses.
family?
you boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
in case you’ve forgotten.  i’m dead already.
okay honey.
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
what did you pay him?
indeed i did.  but, our relationship. it's progressed a lot.  it's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
something was definitely here.
i never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
roy! what are you doing in san diego?
it's just cause mine is finer. a little bleach'll fix that.
forget it. just get out of here.
you're all just jealous.
breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
not that i can see.
no more cracks about how i look.
how many buildings does she have to burn? she belongs here!
general, hang on... drink slowly. you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight.  a fan sent them to you.
she's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. you lost all credibility right there!
gone with daniel webster -- to marshfield, son.... you told mary to go--
forget about it, i don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
what do you mean?  what's he do?
let's see.
i haven't had a crush since i was
it's a good thing no one's irish here.
you too.
no!
"octopus people?"
happy new year, darling.
and i would like to see a priest.
you keep logs?  my, how organized.
well, when you put it that way.
bye.
'i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. i am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
casharoonie!
that's fine! that's fine!  now fall right into their laps. go ahead. say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off. you know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
it was the nicest thin i've done in a long time.
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
the dolphin was a symptom.
i have one question. how could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
i don't know. this thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
no, she's getting married.
kathy price.
mm.
i'd give anything to have been there.
historic occasion, isn't it?
i tell you that dame's nuts.
put on another one.
set entry grid.
why?
forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
don't worry about me, i'll be fine. i can take care of myself and i'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
you were holding it upside down weren't you?
then you'll be going to school here....?
one man.  he must be good.
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
it's cochrane.
a man, here, can make a run straight through to webb.
uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, i thought maybe...
hi. nice to see you.
come on!
boy...holly...holly.
every day. the manufacturer recommends it.
you're missing the game for us?!
fellas.
i know i'm late and i'm sorry, but mrs. rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
ever shot anybody.
what if it's got a pattern?
what generation are you?
why do you go on about that? what does it matter?
so ray and claude got their pardons, right?
how'd you get this?
knee.  tore it up against st. anthony's.  right before the accident.
know what i didn't know. and don't call me that.
he had a girlfriend?
i kissed shirley felder on the teeth.
well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
he holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
not unless you hear my confession.
what happened with rick?
everybody knows freddie miles.
well, what do you want us to do about it?
you must think i'm an awful sap, major.  just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
your family still carries the name corleone, and you will run it like a corleone!
and what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? wander round lugging your suitcases?
you're walter, aren't you?
do you feel better now that you've said this?
is that you?
what can i do, old man, i'm dead, aren't i?
how is he?
i've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe's club and his house, wade ran into buddy deeds. i think buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car and drove him out by the army post, i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
attractive buttons, yes?  but yank one off, toss it, and poof!  it emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
got a couple of kids, huh?
can you give the court an example?
let's go away.
meda.  meda.
do you ever get an erection for a woman?
carlson!
you've studied me, now i'm studying you. seems only fair, don't you think?
even your play.
big time.
is this enough?
are you a secret service man?
basketballs, frank.  you had us playing for basketballs.
well, we don't exactly have a costa rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
rosalie, you okay?
excuse me madame? will there be anything else?
i don't venerate drug dealers, roger. to the contrary.
like you’ll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round?
jesus, do you make a lot of noise. can't you see i'm trying to work?
i mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
of course not,  they're closed. phil fogarty's place.  he'll do it for me.
some setup you got here.  a real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
because you'll never die.
no, no, don't go in there.
yes?
i told you, elle. i need someone -- serious.
wrong...?  science is not magic.
you cold, james?
silly, silly, silly.
it's mr. buddy felton?
what is that?
no you can't.
there, it caught!
storm.  try to look for the highest vantage point. from what i can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  it is my feeling that magneto has to--
you want some <u>advice</u>.
learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
no shit?
nothing.
it's okay -- i should have known you'd come... saavik's right: this planet is unstable. it's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
i don't know.
i don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  i don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  i just want to graduate from high school, go to europe, marry charlie sheen and die.  it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but i think it's swell.  and then you come along...  and... and then i'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
if it's any of your business, yes.
you're like an undercover guy!
why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. not like you're married.
jesus!
you should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. what'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
no i don't have it.
that is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
did you see that?  that was a w.w.f. hit right there, huh, day-day?
same.
no.
i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot...
no.  that's terrible, charles. what happened?
i just wish she'd get here, that's all.
the boys said no.  she wouldn't give her name. a month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
no, no.  i'm not powerless.  because ... because i understand the system. i believe i can control it.  maybe not control it totally.  but ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
the law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
huh?
he is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and i have done my best to oblige him. however, in the last four weeks, i began a relationship with another cadet. what do you think of that?
where've you been?
what year is this?
listen. something's been bothering me about last night.
no, it is china, my country, my history.  if any of it gets damaged...
i'm asking you seriously, sarah, a stranger?
sam!  what happened!?  you had me scared to death.  are you all right?
tell me about it.
you mean nobody died?
i don't know -- i don't know--
i got a call from him today. funny. he dropped out of sight during the war, and i'd heard he'd gone east. i guess he's back.  it's a mission number.
she's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, mr. thompson.
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
i mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. i don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
don't you bave a car?
puff, i'm proud of you! you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
what, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  how dumb you gotta be? that's exactly what they --
so do i.
i think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
it's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. the part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. they didn't know about it back in the sixties. even now, it's not understood very well.
it's already begun. if you want to save her, send her away.
i'm your family.
this is it.
here's a fresh one.  why you? your colleague mr. wilson says jerry won't speak to anyone else. that seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
of course.
ted, will you take it easy? revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  now just relax, okay? everything's gonna be fine.
git up. i got sump'n to show you.
oh... i see.  i understand.  how is... the emperor?
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. so far, they've had no success.
i thought we all had separate rooms.
you've lost interest...you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
no, no.  see, all my life i've done things for other people.  in high school i played football because my old man expected me to.  then my parents always figured i'd go to law school, so i did.  football scholarship.  graduated phi beta kappa--
here's to  you, luther.   to being off the disavowed list.
: wait. do you know any gay guys?
fuck it's over.  that money's mine.
the palace of the legion of honor. the art gallery.
no. don't do this.
foredecks. crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area. can we move in closer?
i was just looking in an old annual and...
hi mom.
he's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
mind if i throw up?
do you believe in them?
we were, and we lost him. he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. the bar was on ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where louis was found dead. it looks like louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
i mean he's of your race. he's an ape.  look.  you don't have to be afraid.  we've put him in chains and under sedation. do you understand that?
i ran him through bci...got a hit. busted for sexual assault: march 22, 1970.  eight days after the last nightingale murder.
why didn't you go before we left?
of sorts.
apipoulai!
and joe ramage - do you remember him?  he comes and helps out in the shop.
how old is your cousin?
some say you are, rocky.
no, alex. it's, it's --
and three weeks.
let's get out of here! i'll lose my job!
no -- it's not that. it's...i'm just a little on edge. i'm really sorry.
watch it!
the kid looked desperate.  i figured...
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  worn down to nothing now.
that'll be thirty-eight cents.
yes
oh, let me get out of your way then.
my father built the house where i was born with his own hands.  oh, it wasn't a big house ...
no, almost never.
has sue got it right?
a mistake.
yeah.
no, me, me, me. thank you.
don't worry.  we're not moving.  he is.
i'm only safe in the russian zone... i'm safe as long as they can use me...
you used the toilet, now you can go - what i do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
that's not for you to decide. everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  the police will want his description.  is this a picture of him?
why?
what's the other name?
where've you been riding, lance?
we need weapons.
you're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
where's molly?  she's not in her room...
where's bella?
look i just wanted to say goodbye.
how bad is it?
i watched from behind the stands.  didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "the drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... i don't know who. there's no one i can trust. except you.  can you get away? just for two days.
well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
you know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
victor, wait, slow down a second. i want you to know i appreciate everything you've done for me, but i just don't --
you're okay, though, huh?
ow! these chips suck.
things go round 'n round, don't they?
landon. you're not the quiet type.
local girl, karen murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
railroad tickets.
how long do you intend -- ?
for you, trapper.
i'm being a pain, huh?
i wasn't.
what's the matter, hon? is anything wrong?
just throw some money around. money, money, money.
i suppose i'm serving my purpose, aren't i.  i'll ring for the guards.
know who this is?
er, well ... the thing is ... i thought your son was a lady.
that's too bad.  i don't like water.  i don't like being around in.  i never go in it.
so what're you goin' up there for.
what do we do?
how do i even know which one has it?
eddie. the name is eddie.
we'll get through this, i promise. i'll make it up to you --
what is it, johnnie?
what do you mean?
that must be interesting.  what drew you there?
rowan and i will be together now. my time has come.  your time is gone.
apipoulai!
you actually think you're the "buzz lightyear?" oh, all this time i thought it was an act!  hey, guys!  look!  it's the real buzz lightyear!
that was my card, pop! my card! you hit for my card!
and that was only my first try.
how real does it seem?
straight.
you know, i hate to be crude, but i'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
well done, lad.
you disappoint me, epps.  always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  i had respect for you.
whoa!
my help?
that son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
don' need you okayin'.
kinda money, huh?
a good question.  and a simple answer.  no more hunger.  no more smog. no more overpopulation.  no more war.
how do we do that?
yes, you can.
mr.-  taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
she said yes.
but charlie – why me? why –
out on my back when i was a small boy.
let me explain something...
mr. preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
does it?
yes, why?
of course it's alright.
state your name, please.
very well!  now that i know it, i will no longer love her.
"elliot"?  the heroic goddamn fireman?
no, i touched me.
i'll take a piece of that bet. i say it doesn't come up five times each side.
orson, you wanna take five?
no, that's just it. no.
 a slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, i need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking. we'd be set up for life!
big –– see! i don't want one for one night. i want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad, samarkand . . . a great big one.
and what exactly do they intend to do?
my abode... my domicile... my neck of the woods... hungry?  breakfast?  a fruit pie perhaps?
granted, the cops are not an alternative.  certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
the genesis planet is gone.
are they all as -- small -- as that?
i wish you wouldn't talk too much. we let a car get away. 
who is it?
who is she?
i'm fine.  really.  leia ... when i was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
what!
did he make your life miserable?
daddy was washing rachel.  in the shower.  what did you think that was about?
bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
what do you mean?
listen. i'm not like myers. he makes you feel like you belong. and -- that's good. it really is. i -- wish i could do something about this --  but i can't.  i can promise you only two things... one: i'll always look this good. two: i won't give up on you. ever.
sorry. which view would you like?
why the fuck should i respect her?
the fuck you talking about?
are you sure it can't hurt us?
well, what do you think?
okay, well, then, i'm gonna break new ground.
yeah?
'preciate it. claude.
no.  who's art mooney?
never this close.
what?
what's the rush, john henry?
how we gonna get that lucky?
that was me they were talking about. i almost died. that was me.
wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
what kind of dancer?
i don't know honey. soon we hope. you want it to end quickly, huh?
dr. sutphin said no sweets for you.
wait a minute. wait a minute. so how did it happen?
all right, love ya ma. listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
who is he, get his name? i'll kill him.
this is bueno.  they had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
reef!
how?
have a good trip.
the robbery.
excuse me. what did you say?
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life, jesse james?
you name it.
i mean if you knew it were stolen.
i don't know about this, dom.
well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
dope?
you usually don't work on sunday, major?
rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
you're being deliberately obtuse.
come, now, you must not talk that way.... you have to adjust yourselves.... we must be brave.
there's a satellite call for you.
hey, lady, i got faults, i know i'm not perfect but i don't get this at all, your attitude.  i saved your...
it's cold, daddy!
artoo, you did it!  i never doubted you for a second ...
this a private clambake, or can anybody join?
and where's the secret base, sir?  the one we t-takeoff from.
disappoint me? why, what do you mean, dear?
he didn't say much at all.  honey --
what?
you don't look so okay.
i didn't.  i didn't. i mean, i did, but then i did exactly what you told me to do, and i came right back.
ed, how're you holding up?
don't worry, you already paid me. i'm here because --
charlie. about last nights..
i sabotaged it?  you're the one who lost him, remember?
it's gonna be fine, orson. you're gonna do great.
"anticipation of incarceration"?
don't be so down, man.  money's gone...shark's gone...we're back to conch...we've got it made....
what are you doing?
there wasn't anything like that. the police and the fbi people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  my husband... his heart broke when mary left...
i have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- i want to avoid it.
and i'd take it in a second, norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton, ohio.
<u>jack</u>!
see anything?
am i one... or many?
tell me.
how long has he been dead?
so to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
your father should keep you better informed. he has bought me for you. he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday.  you are allowed to show your pleasure.
i can't say anything, i'm sorry. 
all i have to do is squeeze.
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb.
don't tell me it's not the gas!  your mother thought she smelled gas.
don't run. they'd like any excuse to shoot us.
stop! you aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
well, why would she want a sun dress? she's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
i understand...
open it.
what are you doing?
we're supposed to do fifty apples. we only got twelve done.
you get ketchup?
you investigating those murders out at the lake?
yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- i'm sorry, jabez.
i'll listen now. after your father's murder, you were orphaned. you were ten years old. you went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in montana. and - ?
oh, yes you will, ann dear . . . you're very clever.
where are you going?
maybe i don't want you to.
what's wrong with your shoulder?
someone from another world--so entirely different. one gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! and everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us.
peters is right, no one's here.
thank you.
how much longer is it gonna be?  i'm hungry.
why?  well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  i know i don't know you all that well, but--
right, and how long have you had these pains, mr. barber?
get the fuck out.
i heard you was more than friends. i heard dick rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
with that set of lungs -- she should be.
that be so, better you pinch yourself now, jack.
are you challenging me?
nothing, i guess.  just an observation.  she's really something special.  you're a lucky fella.
i'll get some.
oh.
and talking is talking! well, i think we better get on.
look, it's a fairly straightforward question. you're either divorced or you're not.
i was in the basement fixing the pipes.  would you believe that?
look.  dan's parents were pushing him. pushing him hard.  he was bitching about it at the party last night.  he was under pressure.  we all are.
getchmis olsun
always.
i didn't want you to be upset. i shouldn't have lied. stacy, there's nothing between me and rachel banks.
hello?
yes, madame?
this is how i met --
that's very flattering.
dashboard.
what are you hiding?  why are you afraid
for what?
it's that gardener!
floor probably leaks. this area is full of springs.
<i>they can do subtitles.</i>
we'll take this high ground. lookouts there and therte and up there. if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
yeah, it is.
but you studied psychology, right? you did the training and just never got the degree?
maybe if you're on the coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
continued
no.
you got a good lawyer?
if you wake first, wake me up.
gabe, did you come back to stay?  you didn't.
it's about destiny, picard. about a reman outcast who...
hey.
don't you?
does something else worry you?
thanks, i already ate.
i got all i could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 march 50 calls. average price of $47 a share and $4 per contract for the call. i just wish i could've got more.
oh, "dr. acula."  i get it.  i don't like it.
what's wrong, doctor?  you seem... lonely.
i'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  it may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
working.  charlie and i were going over some statements.
look, man, i don't want friendly conversation. i don't want to be your friend. i've seen your friends and i don't like them. i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job.
i have only one thing now. are you interested?
i guess so. but wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
i thought i told everybody to get out of my house. that includes cocksuckers and retards. get off your asses and go.
a secret army.  the army of the twelve monkeys.  i've told you about them. they spread the virus.  that's why we have to get to philadelphia.  i have to find them -- it's my assignment.
please get to your father and send him and the police to dorothy's apartment right away. be sure your father comes. something is happening over there. they're hurting someone. the guy she loves. tell them to hurry. i'm going over right now.
hello, evan. it's very nice to meet you.  he's as handsome as his father.
i don't remember you.
where?
what are they doing to him?
wait a minute!
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything. the fall of the british empire, the cold war, the internet.
yes ma'am.
please sit.
always has been.
mom!  for the last fucking time, i'm telling you laura didn't want to get married!  she is not that kind of girl!  to use a phrase.  that's not what happens now.
we? i don't think so.
no, i'm concerned with everything.
i thought it was mrs. feur, but it's not...
yes.
yeah, but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
what's ozzy trying to say there?
does he bite?
who sent you?
come on, pop.
it wasn't the gold.  it was the claymore mine.  the gold's in my pack.
peter, what can i do for you?
what a place for them...
and you got skye davidson.  pretty big leagues for a first timer.  do you even like movies?
that's him.  simon doucet.
the children. where are your children
am i on my feet...?
i am listening, my son.
no... it's fine.
did he try to?
boo.
the funny thing is, i started to believe he really was my dad.
oh, mrs. lampert! i'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  oh, dear.
oh yes.  jerry maguire!  my agent! this is a fierce, loving individual, i love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
what?!
well,then i have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
not so bad. we'll get you to medical quarters. you're going to be fine.
want to hear my favorite aria?
never mind.  i'm glad it's gone.  made the store feel strange.  who'd make such a thing?
she's a good girl.  she's a little nuts, but she's a good girl i think. she's a little daffy.
you're going to enter a world of pain, son.  we know that this is your homework.  we know you stole a car--
what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.
the second one just dies.  a 16 year old kid.
paul's grandfather.
and you will come to hear us tonight?
honest to god i'm broke -- gimme a break.
mr rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
no.
might as well take the rest of the day off. you look sort of fucked up. you've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
but alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
anyway, victoria's nice.
elementary, mrs. peel. trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
you have ten seconds.
anna... maybe it would be better to wait a while.
yeah, sophie.
right.
but not everyone's imaginary, are they, mr. taransky?  i refer, of course, to edith.
i just hope this is still good up there.
as the wife of one of our party.
well, not exactly. see, i met this girl. real nice girl. god-fearing girl. her name's sylvia.
you have to.
you disrespect our tradition.
damn you, de sade!  you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
the craftsmanship is extraordinary.
go on.
why?
you are so good to me.  will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
jesus, sarge, what is this thing?
how's the patient?
stupid cunt!
jawohl?
doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
it's bad.
remember? "and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and i'm lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat..."  oh, shit. i'm so stupid. sorry.
i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
we're going to be fine.
absolutely true, kringelein and i have to raise some money immediately.
i don't know.  a hundred, hundred and fifty.  how many miles is it from colombia to miami?
you wanted to let sonny handle it.  i would've moved in when we first found out.
no she's not --
why you hang around with them greasers?
ma! leave me alone!
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
lydia, i don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
this is ridiculous!
i didn't eat any pizza.
not for lack of love, i can tell ya that.
hi, i'm here to pick up ben.
get up.
i always wanted to go to zegema beach.
i'm pretty sure we do.
you broke my heart.
i don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
not that salesman's wife. and why didn't he go to work today?
oh! something bit me, too!
what list?
go around him.
maranzano wants you dead.
funny thing happened after my physics class today. harry osborn--
i think about that.
we find an event that connects both families. same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  if we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
what do you know?
it's a little late for a wake. she's been dead nearly a year.
you were going to kill me? drink my blood?
mrs. windham vandermark?
you should have been with us in nursery, daniel. i'm positive i recognized him --
again?
fucking zombie.
i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!
greer to murphy.
we have to talk about <u>money</u>...
no. you drove us here.
well--me, too!
i figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, son.
i'm looking for potential.
the supernatural! the powers of darkness! it's all true. take your own life! suicide, david. join me.
it has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
thank god for you, faith.  i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  you don't know what a service you're performing for simone -- shielding her from those animals.
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
i have always loved him.
and second?
what are you?
i get my revenge and make some fast cash.
cool off, huh? how's this for cooling off?
here.  go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
oh, i don't know. i mean look around. isn't this a fun place?
he became obsessed with her. she hated him. he had to have her. he kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. i'm not kidding. frank loved blue. blue velvet. he had to have dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
yeah.  but when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. the fabric tears.
yeah.  he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia, but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - honey was killed...?  poor girl...
well, go on and take it. work for somebody else! that's the gratitude i get for --
and just think if i got her the ring she really wanted.
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  it put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  we laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  when a bird called, we answered back. every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  we had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  i sang "oh promise me." can you imagine? where the hell did i ever learn the words to "oh promise me"?  looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b-36.  all the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  never stopped drinking blue soup.  blue soup all the time. we'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
you all right?
but you'd love for him to play at usc, like you did.
but i have had much practice.  as a child in the west, a platoon lived with us.  they'd let me play with their weapons.  the scabbard is so beautiful.
i never bought that.
civility is a secondary virtue.  it is superseded by duty.
goodbye, francis.
my lord, that little baby of yours virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
judge must have money riding on the championship.
honey i don't have the time...
that's two bucks, joe.
what is this?
i didn't do too well for you.
oh, it was...  really weird. but she's a very nice woman.
this is serious!  i don't have my license.  he was my ride.
i saw his teeth in the bathroom.
where's the beauty you promised me?
i'm only interested...
i'm always working.
so?
sir, i'm flattered that you even recognize my name. my god, i had no idea you were in hollywood.
no, no.  that's just something she "said." we don't have to do that.
yeah i did, treasurer. shouldn't you be studying or something.
it's not sunday? i missed you. you shouldn't leave me alone.
charlie -
what did he talk to you about?
no, i don't. i'm sorry. i wish i knew more.
we was worried about you, cease.
i did. we played three games of backgammon and...
of course!  ivo shandor,  i saw his name in tobin's spirit guide.  he started a secret society in 1920.
what are you?
see, the jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the sabbath from the week, the jew from the gentile.... as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
one drink minimum per show. everything's ten dollars. now... tell me what you want or i'll eighty- six you.
i don't know. probably not.
three and a half hours?
i think so.  but they're in room 408.  on the fourth floor.
well, you've got your information ahead of new york, i see that.
i'm fine. you rest.
well, even without anesthesia i always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
we went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
my daughter...
5000 -- that's just what i owe you.
utah, you copy bruddah?
this is a convent, not a clinic.  we offer moral guidance, not hardware.
don't know what you're talking about.
what was that for?
what's...
but the same song.  i think it's fantastic!
this is going to stop right now. right now!
if you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
as for example, what?
you've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. you'll have some dueling scars to boast of. that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. they say a mad man has the strength of ten.
the--the officers.
not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
yes, i do, sir.
by definition you're lying to ann, too.
i grew up with wally. i began my adult life with him.
it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
how would you know? you're looking at my tits.  jesus, carl. your job is to keep us on the road!
you really think there's a treasure inside?
what gave you that idea?
i wanted to kill him.
listen -- all i really want is an estimate.
i'll talk to you tomorrow.
i know. it doesn't make any sense. that's why i trust it.
they're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
what was that?
do you know lily?  phil..do you know her?
but you fuck with me. you fuck with me all the time. you make crummy tea.  you rip us off on the hash.
oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if i let you get mixed up in this.
what?
oh dear....easy honey...
who else can give me information about you?
sure, auggie, i got it.  the store's closed.  and when do i tell them it's open?
vox...
care for a smoke?
how much do you need?
seemed like a good idea.
see that...know who lives there? the name george earhardt mean anything to you?
i understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint.
shoot sailor in the head with a gun... now i'm beginning to get it... you want me to shoot sailor in the head with a gun.
this is dorsia?
will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
where do you live?
what?
what else did you learn from your mind meld?
how'd they get onto you?
i better get the kids home.
can't you tell me later?
i want sleep more than anything. except maybe, food.
susan!
what do you mean you can't?
are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? what you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! and you won't be able to take care of them, either. there's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
i don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
dad's fishing trip, grandma's knee operation, grandma's birthday...
right's right, goddamnit! don't you care what's right?
mom?
i'm real sorry, laura.
course maybe you don't have to wait until i faint.
that's easy enough.
i know it must be hard. but you have relatives in london --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
is that what they told you?
no! dad, get your stuff. we've got to get out of here.
that kind of talk is between us. don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
ed, it's over.  i need a normal life.
oh, and don't bother to make up the room. that way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
can you take me to color me mine?
you should do something about this lock.
what do you mean, "good looking?"
forgive me, gentlemen.  i'm late.
maybe you wanna try the china club.
where is it touching you?
yeah ... i guess.  i don't know.
is that what she said?
hello.
if we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
and stop threatening that boy. he doesn't have the money. mrs. lampert doesn't either.
no.
this had better be good.
no i don't... the host is enough.
david was right, wasn't he? it's just to keep them busy.
well.  alright.  what is it?  what's, he, uh...?  he had an illegal immigrant, was his gardener, some years back...?  what's the thing?  you people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
thank you, my lady!
all you been through... i ever tell you what a good friend you are?
cow!
we want to dust him. we truly want to dust him bad.
macbeth, right?
cool your jets...i'm doing a little damage control.
i think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  look at me -- not counting the american -- i've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
at school they'd always say "go" first.
but you're sure?
what do you want?
technically, that would be kickin' it old testament.
this is a different one.
he's at work while i'm here.
go on - go on - see if i care. but it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow.
he said he heard hammering.
you afraid of the dark?
-- do you know what these are, elaine?
look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, i mean real combat.
sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
no, not anymore. it's too... it's too far.
i didn't see a warrant. did you see a warrant?
you treat her nice.
well, you see billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. the turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
if i didn't put it on somebody else would!  i was his friend!
i got there just short of too late.
he's not there.
what’s a french private investigator doing here?
i have no idea.  i was right. there were experiments. i knew it. i knew it. my god.

mordechai, santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian. the man's a demon. there's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of.
who the hell was your father?
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
it's not your fault. see, you have this condition...
now don't that call for an extra!
bird flying south-you think he sees that line? rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. so why should a man?

demille is leo.  i'm scorpio. mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks.  today is the day of greatest conjuction. now turn around.  let me dry you.
there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith
that's not the issue, delmar. even if it did put you square with the lord, the state of mississippi is more hardnosed.
that's deep --
i am not talking to you, bitch.
daddy is coming for us.
right.  don't say my name, just listen.  somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
what is that? rum and coke?
otherwise, you're not ugly.
history is on our side, ben. it's no accident that the great explorers were named hennepin, nicollet, marquette.
sounds like tick's already celebrating.
let me guess. the floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
what brown hands you have.
the commission don't decide how i spend my honeymoon.
two days, we got two days! don't do nothing. don't touch nothing --
how did you know?
she's in love.
i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
yes.
the nightmares.
i suffer from insomnia.
what?!
nope.
that's not why he's sending me.
all you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
...so give me the fuckin part...
yes, sir, of course, sir, i was merely speaking hypothetically.  if this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  but of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
need something else?
you got it.  what's happening?
no.
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  i decide when i'm done with your boyfriend.  not him, and certainly not you.  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
you said we weren't "real," cole...
advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
we're saved!
so... we must free more canadian prizoners?
what's so important in los angeles?
ed, everything goes off. "cheers" went off. "mash" went off --
maybe it's not such a waste.
yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? even if i sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
yellow bird... is gonna sing.
you're welcome.
which god would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  in your world, the lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. but in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
is this yours, larry?  is this your homework, larry?
glasspack. he said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now i dunno. he's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
told him what?
i have. sit down over there.
jimmy, how's the -
that idiot!
yeah.
you said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  why?
this makes special k look weak. it's a euphoric blockbuster.
maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
at ease.  i'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left gateway but...
michael.
do you really think you can beat him?
darlin', rose has got to go!
no more than this?
he's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
because i never have.  that's why you go places, isn't it?
maybe you're happy.
yeah.
you sure you're ok teddy? you're not bowling are you?
who says you have to know the king to be in a hole? i actually did have a real job once. when i was in high school, i worked as a candy striper.
nothing more than a bother.  have you any news for me?
frank, i have something for you. excuse us everyone.
nah, you go on.
my best friend -- poor, baron -- dead -- just like that.
oh. yeah.
i already have an employer.
i just left the garden, it was empty.  what did you see?
what a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  it was my understanding we left all that behind.  but, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
what can i do about it?
you know, at the bus stop.  with the hair?
i just can't look at you.

i need money.
i got my .38 here. that's six shots and two refills. downstairs, i think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. maybe a couple boxes of shells for the judge.
no.  i don't.
but i can't be dry.
really!
it broke my heart when harold died.
you're beautiful..
look, someone gave her the baby.
what are you doing here?
now listen, jackie, i'm not jealous of anybody, i just can't afford to get caught... off base.
i have a job.

athos, the former musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the musketeers' gate.
and that was the end of it?
shut up!
well! a precedent is being broken. er, emil!

sick vandalism! brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! i want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby buster browns!
no... why?... should i?
what?
nothin' will happen to you. you get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
do you think george is a fairy?
that's confidential information, little man.
to the cops?
that's enough.
and maybe you lie...
sometimes i feel like my parents don't love me.
why?
well?
... no...
this is what i call my secret place 'cause i come out here when i feel like bein' by myself. i used to come here with karen cross. she's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. she says she likes jerry maroney now. but i'm gonna get her back 'cause i love her. we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. she didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause i don't have any money. well, mama and me, i mean. she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. she said she loved me, too. out here. settin' right on that stump you're on. see, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. so's jerry maroney's daddy. he owns the ice plant. was your folks well off?

so hawkasaurus, i won't mince words...
...yeah, go ahead.
we'll talk some other -
they could put you back in the tube..
what's her problem anyway?  did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
let me see.
no, fuck you. this rope is bullshit. i'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. must weigh 30 pounds.
i ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
cool.
why would it?
the problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. you try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
dr. green...
i don't want to talk about it...
according to my information, today.
time out....jason dean. your pop's fred dean construction. must be rough. moving place to place.

i carried the king's child!  the queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!

stop this now.  i'll do it.  i swear.
did you break up with charlie?
i guess you're right.
and i'm overwhelmed.  and i want to do it justice.  and i hope we can spend time together.  and i'm gushing.  it's my worst quality.

sustain winds 45 knots.
no.  i said that.
you start tomorrow night.  richard carl in "the spring chicken."  i'll get us some girls.  you get tickets.  a drama critic gets them free, you know.  rector's at seven?
so... you brought dino in, and he brought machine.  and, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  and she never walked out.
you're the gambler.  you tell me.
they're not gonna let us in vada, we're kids.
nothing.
whoa! didn't mean to scare you, evan. just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
what does it say?
i know -- and i can't really explain that, but i have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
tell me something, skid --
there's a rumour... i don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der null.
i'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if i can get the right price.
i met with richard low.  these are names of missing persons he has flagged. i'm double-checking every case, but i don't want to be too obvious about it. i marked the ones i'd like you to work on.
i'm always here for you.
what's the next step here, jerry?
i don't know anybody.
mr. white, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
all right, ginnie, don't get so excited.
lee!
mulholland drive.
what are you talkin' about?
i told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
have you made up your mind?
i'm trying to help you.
<u>stensland and buzz meeks</u>.  two-man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants.  when they killed deuce perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
and how do we release the power?
no, ma. not that. that ain't it. but long as i'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe i can do sump'n. maybe i can jus' fin' out sump'n. jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  but i ain't thought it out clear, ma. i can't. i don't know enough.
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  when he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and i want it to bleed for me.
you closed him yesterday.
mommy, i'm scared.
why not?
i don't think they believe us.
suit yourself.
it's the atmosphere. too much pressure, not enough oxygen. might take a few days to --
luke. where you goin?
this is an incredible story - about a man hunting an ostrich, he's been telling me about zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an ostrich.  i'm telling her your map is poetry. the arab shrugs.
terrible boring.
what were they hiding from?
i don't suppose you've seen her.
you promised you'd meet projections, alan.  a dollar sixty per share you said.  so, i don't think this is so surprising a visit.
can't find the shotgun.
two hours at prayer!
no one brought them here! no one wanted them here!
you can't go in there!
he flies as well, then . . .
are there any more at home like you?
five minutes to cloud boundary!
like a party for all our friends.
oh, yes, that's right. did you see the new play?
we'll find out soon enough. if you don't pull the splices out.
how many men you killed?  ain't you gonna answer?
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
have you seen those ads for titanium power men's deodorant?
i see.
if you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe i can understand --
throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
she's done everything i wanted. she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable. she even found his bogus swiss account...
meet me at this address after school.
no. no way!
real rain?
you don't believe in suicide.
ted, all my life i'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. then all of a sudden, i was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get.  only... i guess it wasn't far enough. so i started going to a shrink.  ted, i've had time to think. i've been through some changes. i've learned a lot about myself.
none of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  i realize this sir, but something flipped us over, i doubt very much it was a mink.
that's him.  he's a lot prettier in person though.
that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
i missed you, lieutenant.
ha, ha... all right, well, uh i guess you can bring out the pasta.
no, sir.
the 6 horse is last.
did you see that? some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
huh?
no, sir. i haven't started till monday. i'm a "tourist."

sorry...
yes, but then she finds out i've bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night.
he's all right. he'd like to see you. but listen...  what's the law doing to me?  do they think i did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
i appreciate you lending me a hand. that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
who?
the japs did it.
yeah!
what's going on, my friend?
i'll pay the rest next trip. we only caught sixty ton of skipjack around san benedict. we hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
"rumor: pat boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. fact: pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."

unlimited energy out there.  enough to run this world for all eternity --
i am?
what about you?
where's everybody else?
i can't walk two blocks in washington without hearing about "g.i. jane."  you're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
i don't think so.
c'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
just what i said. don't look so scared.
all right! enough! i've heard this from schaefer and rko. i've heard it from everyone--
i hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, mr. cluett.
mom?
we're vice, i didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. but if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
have you?
holly!
make love to me.
you a blue-moon fool.
i can play the piano?
kay?  what's your 20?
he wants to talk ya.
you don't need to know all of that. you're just a boy. you need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. they'll be plenty of time for the other.
do you always keep old newspapers around?
what?
halloween is coming, soon.  you will have top dollar if you watch for me at the showtime, tomorrow night.

as surely as if it were my own!  harry, give me back the enterprise! with scotty's help...
so what brings you to l.a., bones?
uh, well... not exactly. you see, i exaggerated a little there.
i'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
i beg to differ.  one is a command decision on your part.  the other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  tell him to see me at my office.
harry? are you okay?
i don't know. i try. every day i keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  i'm off the booze, though. haven't had a drop in six years. and now i've got me a wife. doreen. best damned woman i've ever known.  and a little boy, too. cyrus junior.  so things have definitely improved since i got fitted with this hook. if i can just turn this goddamn garage around, i'll be in pretty good shape.
viktor, we simply have to talk about "eternity..."
drive through it!
yes, cats, of course. what else could they be? cats. of course each one has his own name too.
i'm going to tell her.
-- that i was a marine.  which is true.  you filled in the rest.

the vice squad?
it's got a big stone -- in its hand --
you need a warrior for this job. i'm nobody.
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.

harry chaplin. "cats in the cradle."
let them.
i go to school where i live.
turn that off!  get the bags.
i want him to think that.
i agree, baron.
in the city, it happened all the time -- some kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  call the cops.  what are we, immune?
cut their goddamn heads off. every one of them. that's what we're doing in california.
they ever love you back?
it's really pretty outside.  how about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
wow.
and i'm listening avidly, fellow.
ronny! our mother has recovered from death!
we had information bearing on mr. kim's desire to gain admission into the joe boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.

big day. two jaws to rebuild.
everybody loved joey. from the little kids to the old rummies.  did you know him very well?
yes... that should do it. what am i? a luxury?
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
what?
well, yeah. sort of. nothing really mean. me and my pals, me and my brothers. it was kind of funny then. stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. stuff like that.
i don't deserve that. i have never looked at you as a disappointment. if i'm on your back to do better, if i push you to try harder it's because i want you to be the best you can be.
there are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  but they're all part of two warring factions. one:  families that have held wealth for centuries. they want one thing.  stability. group two:  the boat rockers. eisenhower's military industrial complex.  they want instability. it's a trillion dollar a year business.  when there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
god, i m so mad at him!!
how did you know that?
i have no idea.
well, you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi.
we were never told flat out "don't talk." but the message was clear.

after my hiatus, after i got my priorities readjusted, i drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for zero. got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. never found zero, but i did come across some class a scumbags.
probably first thing in the morning. it's too late to start now. i'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.

i know you're a dedicated bachelor. that you've had a your wild nights.
yes, zebra. you'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. the duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, mr. oh.
no. the files are spotless. whatever they find, it's just going to make conklin look worse.
i don't know... i like the army.
damn right, but where the hell were you?
i know this, bill - lyndon johnson got $1 billion for his texas friends, brown and root, to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam. that's just for openers.

freddy?
marion!  what did you tell the police?

you're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
burning me.  it's burning my eye.

hey, you on television?
don't think about it.  it's over.
yes, i find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  the rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
why the suit?
you are ready, then?
we all have to like what we become. cowards included. we achieve this by complicating things a little. but it’s never that complicated really.
it's all in your own mind, father... it's you who imagine that i'm always up here with some man or other....
maybe you should call the police.
i'll page you with the number.

i'll put it in paul's room, where it belongs.
damn, lena...  who is he?

just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
my father used to say to me "never..." no, hmmm. "always..." no, no...  ah! love and hate are blood relations.
hey, what did you want? a lot of fatherly bullshit? a big pat on the back?
...somebody...
betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. i'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
oh, no!  it wasn't anything bad. but she just... you know.  i don't know.

...and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? can you believe that? you weren't even charged. new york police - jesus. i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a. first thing in the morning.
jimmy!  that's why the court exists.  the court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  but to give them a chance at justice.
when'd they file the demur?
joyce can be nice.
buck duff.  i was in maxwell's boost in troy.
i figured i'd be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about.  now where's this kincaid guy the news is talking about? i found this place from a fox 5 tv news report. heh.

if he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
because it's my name.
frances...
that cat ain't mean. i feed him out of my own hand for six years. why don't he kill me? at night in the truck, i let him out of the cage. when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth. i go to sleep. he don't hurt me.

madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
that little shit!
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
no, you never listened. i was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. i had put all i had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.

why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
angels and ministers of grace, defend us.

yes, sir.
well, about six months ago -- i was going to night school, taking this course in advanced accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so i gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing i knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
jesus its huge.

if you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
what the hell are you doing?!!
where is your home, anya?
detective kincaid?
i need a receipt.  sign your name across the flap.
here it is, bruce. one -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
he has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
nor to elizabeth.
... was so romantic.
"like a heartbeat/like a love beat." listen to the di franco twins there. just the plumbing or something, fool.
yeah, i saw the border. through binoculars from on top of a high building. that's about as close as i risked getting. what's the tv say?
well...
look, meet us out front when you're through.  if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
it's awfully clear now. bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. i couldn't do that for him, walter. i'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... is that job still open?
drive.
all right, lunger.  let's do it.
a fine night, mrs. peel ...
oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
i beg your pardon?
really?
he's had his share of "smacks", mothershead. i expect that's what drives him under the bed. we must use patience and understanding with this man.
give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  i gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- i'll check back in a bit.  sorry.  my kid --
i've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
and it is guarded by sixty men.
you fuckin' guys. you ruined me. i'm fuckin' done. permanent package boy.
did you ask him to come visit?
who is she?
i'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. i'll call marcello santos.
hi.
where the hell did you come from?
no.
is this with a girl named kristen?
that's because you keep reminding me. if you go away then i'll forget.
no, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. and darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
yes?
it'll be our secret.
i reckon i feel all right.
but you promised!  i've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
he did or he didn't?
remember, there's safety in numbers.
enjoy.
satisfied?
that's your problem, miles.
beavis.

yes i do!
he's lying. she wouldn't have touched him. he raped her, then butchered her. her blood was all over his coat.
whadda you want!
jesus i've got - to get to the ho--
you were saying, snapperhead?  i'll bet you're not smiling now!
yeh, he knows that.
you could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  tell me the truth --- is it lasher...?  answer me!!
you can handle it?
casualties are light, captain. minor buckling on the port nacelle. nothing serious.
let's stay for a while.
oh, please, don't hurt me.
huckleberry hound?

now put them together. bugger off, you bloody sod.
have you been back recently?
doctor gynde, my whole family's sick. what's going on?
we've got seventy-five rounds for your glock 9, but only twenty for the sig sauer, one pair of visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. you said it yourself -- if i'm not dead, i'm with you.
but i didn't mean to do it!
why is he not here?
i don't, i don't remember. what do i owe you?
that's what i said.
shhh! i heard you the first time.
you were attacked.  my god.  should i call a doctor!  did you call the police...
morning, sheriff.
nigel, get out of here. and don't come slithering back. nigel shakes his head.
charley wade.
we can't shoot the old mill.
no fighting. it wasn't bob's fault.
hello?
you mustn't take it so badly.
i'm so glad to see you. you can't believe the people in here. they've got patients posing as doctors...
well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
they are trying to override the access codes. reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
you want a partner?
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
geez. looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. you call his home?
no. i baked them for you.
how long has it been since you've seen john?
hey. you know-- we're not the same. i got a good life, this job suits me. i come and go when i please --
i ain't gonna shoot you judge. look... it's over. just run away. get out. stay away from oakland. cause it's gone... it's gone.

no, thanks, mom -- i'll go up to bed now.
i can handle it. he's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
you talked to him?
hey, did you hear? sands and kantrowitz dored last night.  survival of the fittest.
a self-portrait.  but over here is my favorite. it's titled "rainbow with egg underneath and an elephant." do you like it?
because they don't like what i want.
just don't tell lydia.
kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. he doesn't even know he's in a -
come on, live a little. i'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
oh... yeah.
what?
how'd you get here? your moms give you ride -- ?
you don't talk to me like that.
roy? it this all we have?
objection.  the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation.
that thing was probably their version of big geek... like an rov.
so did your father...
no. it's not that.
please don't scream at me. i like you, but i don't like the way your attitude is.
i'm going to take marge for a little walk, tom. mr maccarron wants to talk with you.
you're an understandin' fella.
i don't think so.  is my assistant taken care of?
c'est tres amusant... you have been promoted. and to a jew... i am joking of course. naturellement. seriously, nick, may i hope that you have come to play?
i expected more of you, ripley. i thought you would be smarter than this.
you want her dead, don't you?
president vetoes works bill?
and you want these girls to feel your pain?
oh, it'll do in a pinch.
<u>housekeeping</u>.  i come to turn down the bed.
well, are we still on for tonight?
williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
i'll get your bags.
how's peterson's holding up for you?

the world of our children. how dare they?

it's okay.  we okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
you shot charlie pepper, didn't you? and you're the one killed william harbey an' robbed the train over...
surf conditions okay?
one hour!
do you think francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
i can read it to you.
well, i'd hate to be a nuisance.
oh... i'm fired?
pendergast!  help!  it's right behind us!
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  we're making a statement.
a man doesn't always mean the things he says.
oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
we do.
technical... i couldn't help you from that angle. you see, a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
i'm not malcolm little and i'm not satan.
what are you doing in here?
who's this fuck?
really!  listen, heather, i won't take but a minute of your time.  it's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. bob'd love to talk to you.
he doesn't see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.
me too. sounds swell.
shall we try and go around?
oh.
don't need to think fast to handle beer.
wow...
so caesar, what did it total out at?
so, william randolph. your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
well, let me do that for you.
how far is it to california?
well, mr. "c", how about buying a girl a drink?  two bourbons.
do i drive? uh, no, i gotta-i gotta problem with driving.
what were you doing there?
in the house?
this is great.  the crowd's gonna love this!  hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
and here i am...
cloning from what?!  loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand!
thank you for showing it to me first. i'll... i'll take care of it. can i have the picture?
what did you do then?
i'll pay you back.
i agree.
you never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
i don't know what to do about you, sean. i'm more than a bit muddled.  i need time.
... no.
i'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
yes, we made it!
what was that?
get back from the shore.  we know how fast he can leap out.
i'll grow old. we'll both die. and we'll never have known each other. that's sad. at least one drink for a dreamer...what's your favorite drink?
you're not going to trial?
maybe i can turn it into a bit.  i can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  demand a recount...
even the bedchamber passages!  let none remain!
i'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and i -- anyway.  i'm sorry.
do you have any music?
...gger.
calendar for the day. you'll find the senate manual in the drawer. anything else you want, just snap for a page.
you must have thought about it. everyone does.
she does have one thing you don't.
they're nobody's fans! they're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
i thought i was foolish. i thought i'd mistaken infatuation for love. you said:
don't duck the bullet cates. why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
and the baby.
gripping.  it's not jane austen, it's not henry james, but it's gripping.
have you told someone?
i heard rumors you were back. about kip ...
a thumb? what do you mean, like cut it off? for ten bucks?  that include the tip?
all right, let's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying.
what does he know about the highlands?
want some?
but then you'll get huge. your chest is going to milktate. and you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
assuming i go along with this, when can i have the five hundred?
there was nothing he could do.  my husband left everything to me.  i prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  i felt these were my husband's private things.  i didn't... i didn't realize...
what am i supposed to do after i get my nails and hair done...?
mrs. mulwray?
sir -
come on! hurry up! breakfast'll be ready in no time.
they like you very much. but they are not the hell your whales.
oh, boy! a jacket!
forgive my crudity, darlin'. i don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
smooth move, hot-shot.
what did i do wrong?
'63 chevy.
now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. here. he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. here. straight to the canyon. he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
leave me alone.
the pleasure's all yours, officer gates.
you don't? what happened to muff?
where?
as long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
well, i'm saying this, shel: usually i take the contracts to the bank.  last night i didn't.  how did you know that?  one night in a year i left a contract on my desk. nobody knew that but you.  now how did you know that?  you want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  this is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
no!
yes, mister mcmurphy?
where'd you get it?
i thought maybe you forgot...
a ford! a ford! goddamnit, a ford! that's great!
the fact is mr. kesher a representative of your bank called us.
well, typically speaking, they're not. as long as you can demonstrate --
i think someone broke into my house.
my heart died a long time ago.
what's the plan.
oh god, jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
that wasn't me ...
well, that-that's good.  it just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
no. it's new and clean, and waiting.
why didn't you tell me? .... why didn't you hold him?
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
do you think i should have stayed? don't you think maybe i should have stayed?  i've been a jerk, right?  i should have stayed!  i was supposed to be in love... i was in love!  i am in love, why did i act like a bitch?  he went swimming. all the man did was go swimming! i must be crazy.  it was too good to be true.
...how'd you sleep?
now that is very interesting --  take a chair, joseph,
there's no hard feelings, mr denham! i just want to come to the island with you!
which part is that ?
uh-huh.
what's he doing?  answer me!
this doesn't look like the kind of place betty would go to.
what a...jerk!
absolutely...you go have a good time... you have some place to go?
excuse me?
selina?!  selina ... selina ...
yes!
bits of blood and wood.  what else would there be?
what else did she tell you?
but, skipper, cougar's been picked for top gun...he's the best of the best!
yeah.
he asked to go home early.  he said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
great.  that's the fun of working in a record store.  playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  i thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
parsons school of design. i knew growing up i wasn't much to look at, so i put my energy into making things that are pretty.
he's home. i sent the signal.
that's sweet, viktor, but i couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  it's strange.  i've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where i am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, i can't betray simone. there's... i don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
for a fee.
...no....i don't....i don't remember you. who's this?
hello, this is ms. magnuson speaking.
now, you've gone and let don quixote in here again. i told you to keep him out!
it's not like i figured.  it's cold.  and it's heavier than i imagined.
yes, well...  famished.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
willie mays!!! willie mays!!!
next time i'll be ready. you get the word to who ever it is.
we're all excited around here.  my brother just got the congressional medal of honor. the president just decorated him.
i'll pay it back to you saturday - on the level i will. give a guy a break, will you? i've got to get it back in my account. if helen ever finds out that i—
so why go to college?
holy...
maybe it's the way i look. or the sound of my name.
tell you something else.  i can't drink that good neither. i'm going to go outside and throw up.
because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
hi, mr crane.
i think she's disappointed that i'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. she's got some naive, sentimental notions about indians. i'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
you sure? i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily. special blend. can't find anything like it in the states.
burt, i'm not sure, but i may have asked you to hold my calls -  memento blue revisions - 8/27/99
tell me, cindy. would you ever tell me "stop. if you loved me you'd stop."
easy! it'll tear right out!
what have they done to you now?
forget it, son.
i wanna help you, but i don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
great.
i'm really sorry that i hurt you, brian.
i've never heard about you.
do you feel all right, sir?
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction.
oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
michael, believe me.  you know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  i vouched for him and he'll come through.  i promise.  i'll talk to him and straighten him out.  don't worry, ok?
brrrr! she must be frigid. there's two things i know about life: one, americans will never take to soccer. two, swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  they're shag-mad, man! let me ask you a question, vanessa, and be honest.
i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. he can't stay here.
hey, sid. just think if they make a movie about you. who's gonna play you?
one purse--  empty. one vanity case-- 
think about it: you knocked out that jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. maybe lost his whole line of clientele? he knows you're fucking up jess' dancing, and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. he can't kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions. so he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? he can make us disappear out here real nice...
i saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
you dance...
if you lay a hand on him i'll fucking kill you!
what about your meeting?
something else. do most attacks go unreported?
she's jus' wore out, that's all.
nothing. let's go....
hey, rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
this time of year.
no...no stripping...as the hostess.
well...  what do you think about then? i mean...  well what do you think about?
you can't kill me yet.
of course. the man you accuse yourself of killing.
stab it and steer.
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called joseph. he gave you the number of the casanova club. that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go.
when the time's come, you won't need to jump, i'll throw you out myself!
no.
she bought it.
are you crazy!
i was stoned. that's why they stopped me. when i'm not stoned, i got no place else to go. they just protect me from myself.
insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
where'd you get this?
is it true? wallace is captured?
it was fun, wasn't it?
tor, i should be getting home.
who's afraid?  besides me, i mean.
he has his uses too.
don't want no money, ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
silly me. how do i ever think i can fool the super guy. you're right, no bomb. i just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  i confess . . . i tricked you. hey, you look great!
you're scared.
i've enjoyed being man.
hold on, hot lips.  we got work to do.
that's nice. what'd you tell him?
what about...manzetti, the synagogues....
i'd like to walk home with you, and...
i read your book.
aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. the tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't...
it's called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.
so could you walk on water?
don't be so supportive, honey.
are you sure?
di, it's luce.  kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  then i heard coughing, a thud and kansas had to go.  i think her grandma had another heart attack.  anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
what's the use...we're gonna die...
but, there is one... mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off.
yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
what the fuck, seymour?! what is this?
sorry coach.
oh.  um, would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early?
really?
miles.
baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
we're not always as good at things as we'd like.
you go back to that goddamn beach, i swear to god i'll make you regret it.
i need to see you.
well, sort of. vanessa likes madison for a girl.
that would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
that's over the border, general.
not the kids type then is he? not that broody. you must be pretty miffed.
wait here.
send betty my love.  boy you looking good.  i'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  i got something to show you.
he's ten.
what?
you have to hear this, i can never touch you, ishmael.  not once, not ever.  there's no half- way.  as much as i know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
she okay?
do you see her yet?
enjoying our hospitality?
long enough to call victoria a ho.
why did you move the body, doctor?
yeah.  it was a rush thing.  they needed some documents down at the court house.  i barely made it.
hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
answer me.  was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you? was it?  you've been following me around.  do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  that's not love, jerry.  it's obsession. and it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  can you?
what the hell are you doing here?
great bathing suit.
yes.
relax, we brought the cash.
what's he doing now?
you do!
you ran without us.
that isn't granite. if that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
how?
thanks, dad.
jonathan was such a beautiful man. no one knew him like i did... excuse me.  i can't do this now. i'll call you tomorrow.
when i signed on....
really? it must be a tremendous hem.
palmdale.
you know it, lilly.
i can do a lot of shit, d'amour. but you know that.  so i like playing games with people.  gives them something to wonder about...
that's right, raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, i found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  me, me, me, i, i, i, at no point did i say "you" or raoul," got it?
available cash is not an issue for us...
no. it was someone else.
you called the cops on us?
murder.  beautiful.
we're on the verge of a mutiny, colon!
this kid looks like a loser. maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
all right, go ahead!  we go on to the next plane. bring out any people that are left.
i really don't know her that well. we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house, but that was about it.
joe, could i ask you to take a walk? buy a tie or something.  i know i'll be seeing you.
it's elle!  guess what i'm doing right this second?
a look in his eyes! hold your hats, brother, here we go again. you think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. look at him. the bum! and the crush you had on that little abyssinian... .
this isn't the pine tree inn on route 81, jack.
we put our lives on the line today. malcolm x's widow was on the line today. and your guns weren't even loaded.
see those guys?
yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, i-i-i have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  ringing and buzzing. um, am i going deaf, or something?
sam took them to a movie.
maybe it's not going to be so easy. from what i've heard, mrs. teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t. firefly.
hello?
am i treadstone?  me?  what the hell're you talking about?
good evening.
how are you? you weren't in class. i called as soon as i heard...
not bad. it was slow at first, but i'm doing bits now.
jimmy, look, there's something i have to tell you.
oh -- you don't wanna know what i think. topside, now.
no, i'm not thinking clearly - i need a doctor too, to come with me, can i take this vehicle?  i'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  seventy miles - i can be back here by dusk.
i don't find this very funny,
i say it because it's descriptive.
chigurh. anton chigurh. you know how he found you?
where are my children?
no... don't say your good-byes, rose. don't you give up. don't do it.
i said the record is destroyed. the original report exists for all time.  i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
well, that about covers everything.
the water was dripping, see... i turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then auggie had to go out, and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well, later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
cancoon.
maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...i didn't.
why?  what's the problem?
you got the key?
ahhh!!!  i never heard of that term before.  i thought you were black of african-american.  no?
kenilworth.
thank you, but i can wait.
the usual prospects. convicts, contract killers, murde...
work hard, be good at your job. sir. do whatever they tell you.
guess i don't have to worry about him anymore.
last night? what are you talking about, ray?
so what'd i miss?
what kind of mine?
you have a really nice place here...paul. how much did you pay for it?
yes.  <u>yes</u>.  boyfriend trouble ..?
i want the girl.  i don't care about the rest--but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. we'll make headlines all over the world...
him: 'do you mind if i come in for a nightcap, reggie?' her: 'well -- it is awfully late.' him: 'just one, all right?' her: 'promise you'll behave yourself.' him: 'sorry, baby, i never make promises i can't keep.'
that's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. that's how the event horizon travels faster than light.
do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
and you don't want to keep him waiting.
is this my birthday?
aaron was in the dream.  a dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
what is it?
oh, yes. there is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. that is our only contact with the outside world. every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
and the result satisfies.
bring this man a change of good clothes.  has he eaten?
john henry patterson, come in. i'm robert beaumont.  firm- i like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? to get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. i'm sure you agree.  winning personality, heaps of charm?
well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring peace.
now... did you answer cause you thought that's what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
yeah, and he's strangling me...
no superiors!  no scientists.  no people from the future.  it's just a carpet cleaning company.  they have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
some think not.
i don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
hey, girls -- i was on television...
romeo tango zulu, do you have the president? over.
the family hired you and i have just fired you, mr lombard.
you don't need to do that.
no, not really.  i...
a cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named fred madison.
fuck you.  make time.  cause i bust my ass for you.  i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  and what do you do for me?  huh?  you see the way i'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i'm doing?  have you ever bothered saying, hey, erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best god damn employee i've ever had?
you put everything on the line because you...
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. will that do it?
kaminski.
lieutenant... i'm danny walker.  i'm rafe mccawley's best friend.
i always wanted to fly... ever since i first saw a jet. i wanted to fly jets, then i wanted f-14's, then i wanted to fly off carriers, then i wanted top gun.
we walked the place for a week.
howls and shrugs his shoulders.
i think about what i'm doing all the time, and i've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. besides, i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
i braided them.
don't worry about it, dick.  barry's an asshole.
don't be daft.  it's just a student from the university.
why don't you go away?
beg me!
aw, i don't know what you're talking about. all i know is that you're losing your bank and—
it's totally insane! we have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, i get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. i'll be totally wiped out!
what makes you say that?
did you want it to come out?
grandpa, stop doin' the indian walk!
surveillance? by whom?
the six--
i mean, what for?
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
it is?
say more.
the enemy is matching velocity.
yes. it is unfortunate.
well, of course he is!
sir?
and these were drawn from life?
you're lying, mimi.  but then, you'd do anything for money.  you're getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
i never signed the form.
of course.
so... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  he gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. and they get into one hell of a brawl...
"thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
virginia or elizabeth?
have you ever smelled burning flesh? i smelt it four miles away. four miles away, i smelt it. have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? you talk to me about culture, art and music? you putting that in the scales, wilhelm? you setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? they had orchestras in the camps. they played beethoven, wagner. the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. i don't understand the germans' relationship with music. what do you need music for? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated? yes, i blame you for not getting hanged, i blame you for your cowardice. you strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and i say to you, lies!
why are they ganging up against me?
for some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. no matter. i had hoped to have the wedding next spring, lord turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. but fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
you can't judge him by modern standards. he's very much a product of his times. in my day he could have any woman he wanted.
i understand.  how often do you see your son?
where can i find buzz fazeli?
well, who have we here...?
i may have seen her on campus.
coincidences happen.  you run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  split-second tragedy happens every day.  or maybe...
you're outside?
no, you look good. i was just wondering.
i don't know... how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
thank you.  i think so too.  that's why i'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  i don't mean to be a pain in pg&e's backside, especially after all they've done for hinkley, but i look around here and i think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  and i don't just mean pay for the house; i'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
c'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
i do not mean to flirt, marquis!
lee... uh...
some buildings i'm working on.
no.
sure, sure. he's a great person, and i'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
very well, i'll watch.
with all respect, sir, i discovered that portal. its my livelihood.
what if one hasn't a soul any more? what of that?
i looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
i hope you have patience with me.  i do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, i will learn.
fire escape??
that's not true...
whiskey.
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
listen fellas, y'know he's got 'til this week's end. ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
you sure?
i see.  how much?
mr. taransky, we both know i was nothing without you.  i was computer code -- ones and zeros.
you're wrong. they're fascinating. like in a dream... there's truth without logic. what's his name again...?  picasso.
you've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. american tourist murdered --
i don't want you to leave tomorrow.
answer the question! have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
sure.  just papers, photos.  stuff nobody'd ever want.
not once.  what's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? it's really more fun.
no.
you had me scared on the phone.  what's wrong with the baby?
who?
oh, is it?  buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
we did it! we did it, my boy! we're going to see tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! rich!
okay, l.  i am your friend... always. but sometimes... lately... i feel that you don't like being around me because i am so uptight.  no, i am uptight. i hate it... i don't want to be this way, but laura i don't... i mean... i'm your friend no matter what way you are.
what was that?
this is ogre's magic.
yes i do,  but i want you to...
i said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  i've been here before to cast evil from this house.  the amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   it is an ancient ceremony of the early catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
mary clarence!  sister!
can you really see through anything?
i never played a jewel thief.
well, how did you become king, then?
really?
hey, careful on the jacket.  this is armani.  you angry?
see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...  and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
no.
it's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
that's missile lock!
...miles.
i wrote him on monday. they found him dead on tuesday.
kid, that cuts no ice with them.
get it in half an hour.
is there any truth to what he's saying, pike?
have you had a chance to think about --
oh. thank you.
what would you have me do?
what do you mean most, why not all?
this is nothing. ...piece of cake.  y'know, producing is being a samurai warrior.  they pay you, day in, day out, for years, so that, one day, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training at its peak, and save the day.
what about you?  you're not coming?
yeah...a lot.
oww... did you have to make these things so tight?
yah, yah, course i remember.  how are ya? what time is it?
sixty-two thousand -
this is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
woke up real early. sun was shining. just thought i'd mess around, try to learn a song.
how about letting the people out of the bank.  why put them in this position?
oh, just like the president.
can i... can i t-t-talk to you?
don't move, you fuckers.
here's to dovetailing interests.
what's the problem?  what's the problem?  do i need to spell it out for you, mr. garrison?  i better go.
i can see her.
look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. we're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. it's a controlled experiment, but i suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
we could have been killed!  but you saved me!  thank you, mary clarence!
are you still a virgin?
ligourin: how could you do it?
come on, let's call the robinsons. we've got something to celebrate.
you could use the grade, huh?
but nobody had to take care of nicky.
right.
look, i got a rule.  i don't talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
yeah?
uh, gee.  would you like to have lunch?  uh, uh...
in a harem.
no -- mama doesn't dream about you any more, walter. you wouldn't know the old girl now.
what does it look like?
i don't see how... when i'm finished i return it right away.
marzzone?  as in angelo marzzone, head of the marzzone family?
i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
gal, you ain't right yet.
three years i've worked for the railroad. now i don't know why. it seemed a good idea once.
nell... please, nell... take a deep breath...
like hugging a lamp post.
you four are going to have a little company out in the park.  spend a little time with our target audience. maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
i flinched.
rick...?
watch out for that glass.
where is she?
can he do that?
the car's no there yet?
but my day with susie isn't over yet and--
i never thought of that.
no...no you're wrong.
why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  this blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  you down with delacroix.
leggo...
no.  but once i heard...
what i mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
um...okay...
what do you think you're doing ?
looking for a bloke named valentine. know him?
i love you. more than i've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
give me my firebird keys!
you know what the dead poets would say: gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
i'm just screwed.
what are they?
seven days?!  seven days?!  oh, great.  oh good - - clever.
genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. an incontrovertible motive. and definite footprints on jimmy looks twice at maisy blue legs house.
you've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... margo, tell me what's behind all this.
okay, look, i'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. but it's pointless to try to explain it yet. you just have to trust me. i don't have any more secrets.
yeah, i'm sure.
but not his body.
he's trying to prove his innocence.
so do i.
just so you know:  if you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, i'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
what's this guy's problem?
let's get back and call this in.
if they land--
they wouldn't know me.
are you looking for something in particular?
okay. which one do you want?
but it must have been wynant.  i should have known if it weren't his voice.
eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, kicks.
you shot childs and nunez.
flavors!
may i say something personal?
"nocturnal.  external hair and bony plates.  locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "external mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "morphological characteristics: highly robust.  aggressiveness: extreme."
two hundred bucks?
this is my address and telephone number. will you call me?
you still there, sweets?
i don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, grady.
don't worry, major.  your rights will be fully protected.
you think because you represent the former duchess...
the what?
you do something for me, dil?
because it had to look random.  not connected to anything or anyone.  but then why give the rape to me?
totally!
this food is excellent.
where's the tunnel?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... i keep them hungry.  when... when do we think this man arrives.
ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
yes, ma'am.
so, not married.  well, good for you.  you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?
but i think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. i mean, she was still writing about love, right?
oh, i do. you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
scotland yard, interpol, every dutch authority.  i can make them go away.
i'm caroline fortis from the reader. i want to do a story on you.
i've decided to investigate low's plane crash. while i'm at it, i thought i'd look at the cases koessler worked with low.
your color.
some<u>one</u>?  gimme a hint.
don't get sidetracked!  how does he get back to the states?  that's the point.  does he have any problems?
hey, boss!
nice club, mr. gekko...
one thing bothered me.
you're sure easy to talk to.  i wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and i came up to you -- i wonder what would happen.
what <u>was</u> that thing?
from the sun.  it's a reflection on the glass.
...scientists.
shut the fuck up, barry.
everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
sweetheart....
wanted to say goodbye to him...
we cannot break free, captain.  we do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
i know you don't. that's the point. i'll say no more.
no.  no bats, no flying.  they... float, occasionally.  not really flying.
don't you think anyone's gonna notice that toontown's gone?
george, i've been putting things together. do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. what brought them there? unless it was to meet us?
i simply don't have it, joe.
i must. besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
thanks, harry, really, but... i can't explain it. she's my mother. she's just... i can't give up on her that easy.
against what?  harry's unconscious. he's not a threat.
cup of coffee.  i 'been meanin' to talk to you.
boo-boo.
father, did i act like that when i graduated from high school?
champagne please.
look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. just take it!
not to me.  but you will let that cop go home with mr. kane, won't you?
for one kiss, i would defy a thousand wessexes!
who? who did that?
may i listen to the news with you, holiness?
you're really something coco...thank you.
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. they were executed at close range. that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently.
yeah, go on...
you know, mr. m., when i win the presidency, that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. wouldn't you?
fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
she's gonna use you. to protect herself.
you're sweet.
how'd you know that, lowell?
well, they were right out in plain view.
wait, i wanted her to do it.
can i ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
what happened? adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
you want to eat something?
hey, i'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
you have to go. you always did such, uh, you know, great work. i still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
i made it go down the toilet.
hi, frank.
better take care of your fingers, little brother. buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'chopsticks.'
the planet's surface is covered with borg technology.  so is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
why? there'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
monsieur félix -- ?
well, now, he's clear. and you'll stay away from him...
you got a vision, girl.  just like i got. just like my momma had.  and the good lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  that's just wasted time.
enough?
surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
a heavy drinker?
because everything that man's done has been suspicious. trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
david, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying i faked the figures. you're not going soft on me, are you?
no!
can't. once i signed up.
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut.
they weren't my memories.  i borrowed them. it's no good when you borrow them.
how much money have you got?
goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  there's gotta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
we got a mistrial, you know.  joe -- did you hear what i said...?
louis, please -- !
he doesn't know you're out of school. he thinks it's a vacation for you.
what are you doing?!
please, jill ... i love you.
i'm not going without you.
a little.
what'd the prosecutor say?
hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
no. he's dead.
what do you mean, ‘no’, mrs de moraes?
how did i beat you?
rick, this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich.
i'm not.
thank you.  i'll tell him.
mother! you called me by name!
i'm not fighting you, jim, i'm just trying to reach you.  you've changed.
i don't know.  extra apartment keys. what's it matter?
who got the frenchman out?
you got it.
damn near.  and a damn near perfect drug.
intelligent question, nels.  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
shit o goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
but what if---it wasn't real?
i hope to christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
why did he shoot her?
oh no. momsie and popsie have oodles.
so this is what it's like to be completely happy!
what are you doing on the reservation?
how about howard hughes? we could do hughes
now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for dr. hirsch in the morning.
then <u>i'll</u> help them.  for a price.
all right, jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
dad, too. i sold the house. i'm a faceless sinner, harry...
um...
okay, seeya.  vada?
why?
they smashed the phone.  i've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
blood money. insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. in no way have you mentioned that money. and i find that to be very very offensive.
bullshit.
ray, we got the shotguns.
he's working round the clock. but the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
jessie?  looks like your friend found company.
mmmhmmm.
work, work, work. is that all that you do?
hi, this is janice the operator, who's this?
why? why 'come on' all the time? what's the matter?  are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? here, drink it up! aren't you having any fun? where was i?
all right, this one time i'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
which also means when i speak, i'm speakin' for jimmy. so e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
i couldn't prevent it.
i know that answer. if we went to trial would we win?
on what.  what makes you so certain.
dem white boys giving you a hard time?
what about?
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed!
yeah right.  how'd you get this number?
do you think you're ready?
i can't hold the weight of both of you!
i remember a man who wrote i he was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
do what--
what's going to happen when you release the whales?
you want i set up?
well... yeah...
yes, and then, what was there to call about?  everything was up in the air.
unbelievable, huh?
that requires me goin' out tonight?
i picked the wrong number when i chose you ... didn't i?
uh-huh...
we're interested in any new therapies. how would you characterize your approach?
scalene?
fuckin' a.
this is pathetic.
i am. i only work when i have to. two years ago i got a notion and went to china. there was a war going on. swell! after a while it got stale. i went down to tahiti. just lay on the beach for six months. what could be sweeter?
why did you unleash the pipe, i don't know?
thanks very much.
someone's following me.
"rod's been killed - he got rod. just glen and me now.  can't fall asleep!"
you're gonna be on "t.j. hooker"?
"what we want is in that room."
he's not showing it until it's down.  but it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  you and robert got great ratings today. which is the first thing we needed to know.
35% on the math final !  no one could be that dumb with numbers.
what, lewis?
no kidding. i'll bet you have some very grateful clients. what'd rex buy you?
you... suck!  you almost got us all killed!
how can you let them pull that stuff on you? they're just lazy.
what's the thing with morse code...
some fucker's shootin' at us.
good luck, sebastian.
how long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
why?
now what -- ?
i'll pay your way to new york. i'll work, i'll slave. i'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
others?
i'm late.  gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
and the third one?
call my chiropractor.
no, son.  daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
good, what's his number?
what's in this? nitro-glycerin?
yeah, baby...
quiet!
easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
and what about the suicide note? you didn't write that, either!
zion?
things got a lot worse.
oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. how old were you then?
you're certain he's lucid? you won't need any help?
a layman..., layman. interesting term. so many experts on government grants. and you say you're a 'layman?' but it was you who caught me, wasn't it, will? do you know how you did it'
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
boy, did you see her go?
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then i guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
it's a fine spot, ma'am.
hello, what's your name?
according to your mother. when the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
...no.
i don't know ... she had gum on her lip, for christ sake. i don't think she's right for the act.
rather more than a little something, mr. mitchell.
we have a daughter.
you gotta turn yourself in. before it's too late -
no thanks, i've seen seattle.
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place?
then you knew mitch in san francisco, is that right?
so -- you've laid the ghost.
-- it's your ifb, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
vivian.
my antenna is up, it is fully extended, and i am picking up...what is it? it is, can it be? the boy is in el, u, v.
can you open that panel?
not yet, my friend. it's your tomato that's dying.
no dog.
yes.  i'm crazy.  you have driven me crazy.  no one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  how many arrangements had to be made? how many players had to be coordinated?
where's your elastic brace?
what monster?
take a break veronica, sit down.
"fifteen minutes of fame?" i'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
i can't.
i thought you'd missed the train.
i never said that!
allow me, comrade.
i won't.  i'm a lesbian.
i guess.  you're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
did max mention anything about any jobs?
what do that mean?
oh, this isn't my car.  it's down a ways. i should have parked closer.  i just didn't think it would be so heavy.  i could drive up.
if i pay homage to another's throne, then how am i a king?
go die, asshole!
we've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  i wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  still miss your mother?
you're late.
later mate, right now i've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
...could i get you to call loretta and tell her i've gone to odessa? goin' to visit with carla jean moss.
i always wondered what happened with us.
mr. blonde and mr. blue?
how did you know it was her?
it's not going to well?
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. the railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
rooaaaarr!!!
okay -- let's try and settle down here.
you show a lot of promise... but... my concern is i don't know where to book you.  you're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
half.
no, not my girl.  self-control, she had. point of pride.  and people don't change, do they.
no, i'd already sent them home. you can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that i'll get it back soon using my own methods.
i'm no expert, but i'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
bad for your health anyway.
i can tell from the tone of your voice, dave, that you're upset. why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
well...
get the sedative ready!
my shift ends at four, but i couldn't --
i'm not particularly interested, <u>ms.</u> magnuson, in what you think is correct. my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us.  keep him in your office until we arrive.
"dear annie: thanks for your letter.  it was great.  we're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o. sleepless in seattle."
a cab?  ma, come on.  my car's just a half block down.  you wait here.
who?
i'm driving.
oh, it is, it is! death's terrible.
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
al.  man, you were my rock.  i couldn't have made it without you.
longbranch...?
i get it--lee lother have a hand in that, too?
we know what you're up to.
what is this, david?
uh-uh, just cops.
couldn't go on? you'll give the performance of your life.
you are a rich woman.
excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
well, yeah, but --
is that clear?
we have a full caseload, rog.
-- his left jacket pocket.
what do you mean, she was a hot number.
are you crazy, a lift raft?! we're not sinking, we're crashing!
i don't have to like her just because you do.  it doesn't work that way.
you're not pregnant, are you?
when i say i love you.
veidt.  you're the one who started world war iii.
you hear all kinds of things.
and that's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again. so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you've found is back again.
nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret. nurse, come back again; i have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. nurse, thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
the thing!  he was lying there in the street, moaning.  but he pointed at it ... 22
she's the thing you had to tell me.
and, hamilton?  greene?
like when you were standin' there looking after clay. i knew right off what you were thinking. because i've been watching you.
couple of weeks... listen --
he ain't hurting me, but i can't get him down.
it was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. but i had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  oh, i lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
louder, please. we cannot hear you.
get away!
you think so?
hi.  is frank there?
what about her? you didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
you're all three of you in that van?
this is really very nice of you.
we're...not together.
confused?
i guess i ... if i jumped to...
where's the towel?
i've just told you i was busy with mr. bruce baldwin!
nazeer what?
nuthin'.
no.
if they're not at the light, look for them.  i don't want them out there.  get them back to port!
that wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
i'd miss my life...
jesus!
be careful?  you mean you - or me? who?
are you manifesting them?
tom...
oh, i'll get 'em all.
i would never hurt you or lauren. never. believe me.
you look like you've got money in your pocket.
you're a doctor. what kind?
impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
can you turn off the game?
how'd it go today?
for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? and you and anna... no, i guess they aren't like that any more. my god, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
they'll do it.
i would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
grace, i've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  you're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
just trying to have fun. that fucking prison is really starting to get to me. c'mon, seeger. gimme a push.  fuck you guys! i'll do it myself!
there is yet time.  don't you want your own pleasure?
how do we stand?
how are you?  how're you feeling?
peace, everybody--paul, penelope.
it's more like a date.
no problem.
to hide a black eye.
sorry. we got knocked out pretty quickly.
yep.  maggie -- someone to see you.
that's what we thought.
what's going on? i heard on the p.a. system that...
about what?
this is joe white.
naked!?
that's right. alan comes by every three weeks or so.
see ya later.
where you going?
you guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
high school?
what can you tell me about this?
mom and dad?  that's...crazy.  they never said...
yes, sue?  what is it?
you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. if i wasn't already the head of it, i'd want the same thing.
she's saving herself for you.
well, have you ever made love high?
thank you very much, sir.
rennie...??
what is that?
i'm on the roof.
see you downtown.
it's a poison arrow tree frog.
what are you so chipper about?  if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? grave where thy victory?
she was old.
what do you want?
jeffrey? what's going on?
i'm a grown woman, dr. emlee.   i can take care of myself.
somebody's mother.
jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, jean d'aulon.  jean... i place her in your care.  find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
said it went on for donkey's years.
you know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, toddy.  i'll be dropping by to see you and meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
mrs. hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
never proven. they're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. kids love burger god -
maaaaaax!
hell, i don't belong here. i don't know what i' been thinkin'.
i'm really sad it's closing. now what am i gonna do on tuesday nights?
but -
he's dead, isn't he.  buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace.  if they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles.
i'm hungry.
so what was the theme of the pageant last year?
are you...okay?
it didn't used to be that way.
ya sister knows i'm comin'?
anyway, even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. if i didn't know better, i'd swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
i respect life, don't you see? for each and every human life i have respect.
no cubs over fifteen, billy! ever heard of a cub with a green flower? you'll leave cathedral then, billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  if you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
we're good to loan in.
please.  filing a report will not help you find your car.
it's brand new. revolutionary uplift. no shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
"gorsky"?  what is that, polish?
investigation of what?
i seem to be out of gas.
it's not their fault.
what?
eddie, where do you go when you go out?
i'm not looking for an apology, peter.
pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, i guess.
he's your client, huh?
<b>and my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me i agree that there is now a battle to be won! something must be done!</b>
where?
she was here?
what?
i'm in a hurry.
intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
see, what did i tell you? man in new york wants a 9 millimeter smith and wesson model 5946. why does he want it? it's the gun that nigga on "new york undercover" uses. because of that nigga, i can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
i scoured the city for it.
it's about the burglary.
jump.
will you help us? i think something's wrong out there!
what more is there.
here.
...look, they love you, kid – everybody does. you see caven's review in the herald?
roger.
what about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
hemmingway.  killed himself.  i was more upset about that than about groppi, that's for sure.
please, dil --
who's going?
hi!  hi!
you know what?  i think you guys are all jealous.
hi.
but you didn't.
sofie. it's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
well that's what hospice will take care of for you.  they will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
well, hello there...chocolate,
kinda'.
yes.
you said i could be vice-president, cuervo. your right-hand man.
i could take you downtown.
i don't let anybody call me that.
'the heir to the fortune must wear the mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  we should all have to suffer such burdens.
amy, make a wish.  wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
it's just a souvenir. they don't even make the caps anymore.
you're in show business?
mr. hillyer, i know it was bad and i hadn't ought to of done it. but i'm only a human girl and i... i ain't always perfect. i promise i won't let him in the house no more, i promise. won't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me?
if i could get my hands on you...
hey, beautiful girls!
this boat's gonna sail without you, too. i don't care if i last one day out here. at least it's one day of freedom. now gimme those keys.
do you have any idea what my life is like?
i can't.
whichever you prefer.
yes.
hurling's a fast game, isn't it, fergus?
don't worry, i owe you a lot. i'm not gonna let us rot here. i'm gonna find us a way out.
pretty.
this isn't homicide school.
in fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
ho's a fucking pimp! he encourages wendy to turn tricks. and she's his fucking wife!
he won't be back until monday. i mean, if those birds are for him....
i don't know, i have nothing to compare it to.  i guess i thought there was something more to it.
did you have a good week mama. are they treating you all right?
in other words, i'm fucked.
why not?!
not at all!
it was a man's voice. repeating some sort of children's rhyme. i don't know, it didn't make any sense. you didn't hear it?
a bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. this ain't like the old days, memphis. the profession has lost its..
nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
you're not helping.
okay, okay. look, sylvia -- instead of friday - could we make it thursday night?
what you want?
where were you tonight?
peter.  i don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
he's big as a bloody bus!
why don't you come in?
hey, have you seen pearl harbor at night?
yeah, i been there.
the first and only time.  a big mistake.  i'm gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore.
ricky, i...
and she'll fight back again.  god help me, what have i done.
what was that for?
how the hell do you know that?
you do?
do you still think he's innocent?
do you have it in you, lee?  or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
oh, no. i'm tryin' to get off this island alive. i'll help you all i can but i'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. what can you hope to accomplish? some radios maybe? a supply room or two? you'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. that place was built to withstand nuclear attack! what are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
i blame myself, sonny.  i notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  and then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  it's ridiculous. i'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'you pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  yellin' at me in front of all those people.  because you never talked and i never been scared of you, never.  i think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
dios mia.
of course.  drown them like puppies.
may we go home now, please?
halina?
something like that.
he's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
that bad?
if john doe's head splits open and a u.f.o. flies out, i want you to have expected it.
may i have twenty-five cents, please?
well, i'll get it from the safe.
yeah i can't.
they're calling it an accident.
oh <u>okay</u>.
of course he does. but he might get the wrong idea. anyone might.
doc eat already?
no, i didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
maybe i should come up with you.
naturally.
separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  but together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
the "deal," forget the deal. forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, jim, what is it?
you sent for me.
don't wake the kids...
is this where we're going?
spunky?
it's okay - i'll help.  please.
yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when i wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
who?
no. but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other. if you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
i'll do it.
what a trip, man.
do you have it?
you know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
but i assure you, father walters, miss connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
well, perhaps i can't, plank, if you know what i mean.
damn!
what brings the rats out of the sewers?
what are you saying...
that was my last.
hey, you're anti-male.
i'm sorry. it's these soft shoes i wear for my back.
yes, maude, it is.  it is a <u>very</u> good play.
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty. we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
sir, i-
no, i don't really think you're a freak.
what about me?
a gold mine?
who did this?
how do i look?
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt! she apologized, didn't she?
every young man should at least once...go on, laurie! read!
yes, really.  i don't want you to be unhappy, jack.  if you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
wanna know what i think?
non-alcoholic malt beverage?
well how long has this been going on.
well, you do have the dress.
what did he say?
i'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. if you want me to pick you up, i will.
you will stay, doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
and we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
yeah, great....dobchay! it will dry, yes?
-- just to clarify --
what'd he do to you?
good evening, miss.
palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
sometimes i control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
got a bogey, boss?
yes, sir.  thank you.
pinta likes him too much.  she thinks of him as a father.
how many warbirds will you need?
you did good...
no one thought they'd hold out so long.
ms. deane, you wanted to see me?
he was interested.
good night, mom.
they've changed their heading again.
really?
they're coming with us?
--you're going to be on your own.
how's that?
where?
made me feel all funny inside.
perhaps because you've always been a part of shangri-la without knowing it.
how about giving me another coat?
so, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
it pays.
maybe i was hiding.  for years, i never told ben the one important thing.
weather's turning nasty.
i’m worried. amy’s not good at drinking. she gets sooo drunk sooo fast. does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
what do you see?
sure.
why would lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
"beloved son"...  so people stayed together for that feeling of love... they would live and raise children together and be remembered.  i think i feel that way, logan. can we be that way?
just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
well -- last night was not so good.
rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and i've already touched your titty...
you ask me, you and miss muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
the real nazis. hitler, goebbels, they talked about jews incessantly.... you ever read their diaries?...
what's so funny, cadet cowan?
i'm not buying into any of that.  i have a load to learn.  i'm not going to act as if...
bud. mary sue ... breakfast is on the table.
i love you too major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
can't make enough axe-heads!
well --
the vespa? me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
dan'l webster?
yes, but we're just singing.

yeah, well...  in a cab you get to meet people. you meet lotsa people. it's good for you.
i'm vincent.  and i coordinate.
say, 'nigger.'
i love you man
listen.
-- you seem amused.
kill! kill!
tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit.
i don't know. peter has a concert in athens next month -- and he's asked if i want to go along, help out. he says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
and what if you¹re wrong?
but i got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  yessir, i think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  why don't you tell me about your connection.
buckaroo--! sorry--
i was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
what is it you want? what?
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
--it would have been nice to have had this, i sure would have liked to have had this--
shut up!
people do amazing things when they're scared.
no, my mother's .. you better stop in .. i'm just here to feed the cat.
i was a clerk's apprentice on saint croix.  but, then i went to king's college.
you'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
what are you talking about?
very.
then that's the place for us!

but it's not a great syllable
...plenty
lowell?
i don't understand, daddy.
they'll meet you at the top.
neo, please, you have to trust me.

i ran into some people i knew.
the first one. before you where on the island. you liked dinosaurs back then.
a daytime soap opera.
so that means it's alright for you to act like that?
yes, although, i really..... thank you.  yes, it's great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.
picking out my wedding dress!
what is it?
so what is it you do, mr. kint?
how'd you know my name was jack?
how did you know i had sons?
you said 'whoopsidaisies.'
but i don't gamble, hilda!
hey, i want ya out instamaticly. -- i'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- go out -- live! do, enjoy life.
why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
productive. so they're closing down the school?
how did you know it was "carefully"?
i thought you said it was just a blade.
who?
never?
you've already met.
how come you were in my truck?
you know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
i'm not going with them.
brandon!	time to go!
what?
okay.
i'm a nice and reasonable man. i didn't do anything wrong. please don't make me hurt you. and i'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that i love.....i will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.

they're fresh.  i haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? you get chickens in italy but no eggs. in africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. who separates them?
do you get paid a lot?
i'm sure of this. but not of you.  you won't open any joint. i've been watching you change. you're mad now and you think you can change back. but you can't. you'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
what the fuck!? you too!?
<i>the bounty hunters have arrived. they will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>where do you want to meet?</i>
come on. he's a crook.
we know three things about man-eaters. first, they always return to where they've attacked before. second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. and third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
oh christ!  oh christ!
man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
you ok?
blade.
vito!  pino!  let's go.
same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your valentine's card.
when a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  there is no need to rub it in his face.  the smell is the same.
shit!  he sent them all.
she has the face of an angel... she was an angel. she was so kind... so kind to me. it's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. i'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her.
in basic english, what does all this mean?
you mean they weren't up here?
a sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
what now?
what? i was at sandy's i just lost track of time.
did you listen to me?
thanks, but it's under control.
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith, bill jones. i'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. c.i.a. funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
damn.
yes.
of course. jake. nice to see you.
wade, i got a message for you.  jack hewitt, he's looking for you. wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall.
taylor.	i'm telling you --
i will not be held responsible for these revisions.  these changes are not the way i want to go.  this is an outrage.  this is a sham.  a violation!
admiral, may i suggest that dr. mccoy is correct. we must help chekov.
sure.
well, it's true.  just pay me what you owe me and i'm gone.
who's to say i did not?
and my mother's ears. but the rest belongs to you.
look, my life is not so great, that i want it shown on television. and neither is yours.
don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
superman broke your monster, uncle lex.
you lasted eight years, as orderly, in dr. lechter's prison ward.
what's her name?
yeah, why?
whatever.
not skimming a thing, lilly?
what do you do to him?
it's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
i don't have a choice.
that was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
i don't get it.
i could always get us a bottle.
would they notice and eighty-eight?
... not exactly the oval office.
w-w-we h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
show a little respect, nero.  the man was an important artist.
everybody has one like that.  i thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
whoa!... the government. they control everybody's mind. you're too fucking stupid to know that?
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do. the fuckers are going to kill me one day.

it looks like we're too late.
where's my brother?
and many meatballs.
yeah
a statistical phenomenon.  says everything in the world goes in streaks.  it's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  bad things cluster.  they go to hell together.
how ya doin', toothpick?
four interviews. four no-gos.
what else?  i had the boy teach me kendo.  including...the importance of the bow.
mother? is that you?
what do you do anyway?

can you fly this airplane and land it?
miss dupea.
i always did.
you said the "s" word.
do you know i turned down "frankenstein"?
get some rest.  you're going to need it.
me??
me too.  i got a stomach full of xanax.  i took what was left of a bottle.  might've been too much.
now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. if we say move, you move. if we say left, you move left. if we say right, you move right. if we say mole, you dig a hole. got it?
when?
that was a pity...
i don't want you to do the cover, i, i need you to do the cover.
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
no, no i don't. are you sure?
so you think you can?
1868...
what? i thought you were free to come and go as you please.
i know a place in the park where only very small birds go. there are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. it's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. would you like me to take you there?
i must compliment you on miss thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
there. oh, i like the feel of soil, don't you? and the smell. it's the earth. "the earth is my body. my head is in the stars."  who said that?
what do we do now?
we got a treatment on it yet?
detective carter from the haddonfield p.d.
nice car.
...no...
i won't have another mate like ona.  you rate very high in sanitation.  i've checked.  in fact, i am surprised that you were ever matched with luh.  her ratings are very erratic - you know what i mean.  we'll be happy.
a champion of lost causes huh?
who has your undies, walter?
he works for me.
easy. you've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
well, i'm just gonna go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck.
that's what you said in turley. you remember how that ended.
oh warren...oh warren...take me, god take me...
i didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
welcome. 38
it's not unthinkable.
she wants to see what you can do.
gerald wants to see him first.
which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  these are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
no. and i'm not losing any sleep over it.
hmm? is that a professional opinion?
the three unions. it's 43% of bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value g.g., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since texas air...
oh, no, my little volga boatman. have you forgotten our first commandment: never complain -- never explain. it has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. and please don't look so guilty, otherwise i'll...
...i wouldn't worry about it.
me?
you're not going to ....
it's a good thing my family loves you.
he is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! he'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
she planned this.  she wanted us to find the nasal spray.
mr. chance, i'm very pleased to meet you.
i have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the brooke's butt buster workout.
i'm talking about invention, no investment. i know what people think of me. mr. spasmatician. dick the square root. i'll show them. you said i was going to be a millionaire. and you're gonna help!
you've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
jesus christ, man, don't shoot me!
that miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. harry must've been busy.
many machines on ix... new machines.
you?
that's what knocked the phones out, too.
reed?... sue?
it must have been once too often. i think your brains come apart. what you got up there, chinese bells?
how ya doing?
whadda ya mean, whadda i care? who is she? what's a matter? you afraid i'm gonna take her on you?
whatever you say, boss.
pop, there's no way an ivy league team is going all the way.
where will the money go?
well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
never mind. you won't have to do anything for me ever again. i'm leaving!
thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb.  he had the energy source. he had the vacuum.  but he didn't have the filament.  he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
what kind of concerns?
why, beckett?
yes, you certainly will. and you'll find a nice girl and rebuild america. just the way it used to be.
personally, i think it's stupid!  but go ahead. have a good time. as long as ellie doesn't object.
lord almighty.
you're late.
can i use your telephone? i want to talk to new york.
okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
i've seen a lot of people die before.
i'll send your regrets.  honestly, why must i even bother?
lovely sound- they seem happy.
what are you grinning at?  you think i was scared?
thanks.
ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
i'm not!
yes, probably... maybe...
i have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
so?
how awful for john.
do you think i'm pretty?
what?
it also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
what're you talking about?
does it tell me how to get laid?
i think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
why's that?
walking away, yes, sir. here we are walking away.
have a great time, honey!
and a song someone sings once upon a december.
you said it.
but, i don't know how.
well ... if you don't remember anything, i mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
what? you don't think i can have a normal life?
last month.
what'dya tell that soldier, soldier? you tell him we was rebels?
he has a great body
yeah.  but not as cheap.  call me.
why you gotta curse?
yeah.
you did the right thing, daniel.  let's stay in touch, okay?  good night.
yes.
i realize this is a shock.
that's not all.  according to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
i should have known, shouldn't i?
how do you know?
she's downstairs with ruth. get ready.
tickles, tickles, tickles.
shut up. "let's get it on," marvin gaye, from let's get it on. "airbag," radiohead, from ok computer.
let's go.
not guilty by reason of insanity. case closed.
oh, dear. i don't know what i'd do if a whole swarm kept -- oh! oh! oh, there's one on me!
what's happened to you?
don't cry. 
say what?
forget the story -- find the trunk. mrs. thorwald's in it!
yes.  that's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
i don't want no more fuckin' surprises. we do this the way i laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
just for a second. please, rose, what's the harm?
well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  we're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
like what?
so what do we do?  do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
i walk out.
for anyone. they'll never be able to live through the talk. richard will never be able to. he doesn't deserve that. he hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
okay!  we have tv!  we can all get stupid again!
i don't know who that is.
it's true.
why didn't it imitate fuchs?  isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
frankly, j.j., i don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
do your recall the words of saint peter, in ecciesiastes 1:27?  he spoke unto a wastrel youth.  he said, "take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
the captain almost fired me tonight. i'm on my way out. anytime now.
it's make the soup or answer the door.  can't do both.
their new computer sciences division.  how did you know?
what the fuck is this?! i want some service!
-- i have the feeling that, all in all, what i made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
where to?
--i know, i know, the pressure's off the white house and it's all back on the post--
it's no big deal.
do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
have you any idea what these things cost over here?
it's cold.
i know, dear.  i understand. but try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  and especially today — let's forget about it. we want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
i'll take columbia for twenty.
so whose car is it?
crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. you'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. they might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  otherwise they might think...
they're fine.
hold it -- italy just finished. they're recognizing great britain.
you gotta stop smoking ..
that's not funny.
no, no, it's not. it's better.
why'd you do that?  don't tell me you're a gentleman, max. i thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. the instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. the cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
oh, you're sharp as a tack, elden.
yes, sir, name, please?
we'll take care of it.
the what?
yes, admiral. step into my parlor.
have you got it now?
dick burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
oh, it's a charity dinner. the money goes to a good cause, but i don't have anybody to go with...
is there a phone booth there?
good god...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
well, elena and i have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
i'll do okay.
how’s the boy doing?
sal, just do me a favor, leave jade alone.
love me... keep me safe...
frank, don't you have something to say?
aren't you glad we waited?
you know, there's nothing you have to say.  because they know your heart.  you don't have t...
so simple to say, so hard to do.
--what <i>about</i> his profile?
let's wait it out.
fine. nowt wrong with them.
i don't see anything!
you didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
but was it a bad decision?  at the time, i thought her money would save the movie.
well, i've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, i guess.
don't be fooled, madeleine! he fears for himself. he's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
you've got to get a new jacket. really. you must be sick of the same clothes. i'm sick of seeing you in them.
if you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if i get a date or not?
very realistic.
oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. that's where we used to live.
hey, frankie.
how do we know this is the way?
whenever i start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and... i feel better.
can of itself be a problem.
remember, pay attention to how she talks about foley, her tone.  do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell burdon.  tell her you think he's a nice guy.  no, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  if she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  i bet nothing.  so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  you think that's possible?  what kind of guy is he?
hi.  my wonderful junk yard. the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
what, the heat here?
yeah, yeah, i know.  but say i hadn't seen it and i said to you, "i haven't seen evil dead ii yet," what would you think?
they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly.
i think i've met you before, mr. brett.
norman took a wife?
we're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. could be a big help in unsolved cases. most of them have been happy to talk to us. they have a compulsion to boast, these people... do you spook easily, starling?
if you stay, i think something bad will happen. i think i might hurt you.  you don't want to get hurt, do you?
that isn't what you said before.
encourage them to be bolder.
you see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
they're not here.
no. i saw her with tod.
wounded? how?
california, illinois, florida, new hampshire--all the major democratic primary states.  why does everything you play sound the same?
two of 'em?
that was for my ma. now this is for everybody else.
gotta go with the belt there...
i don't want to listen to this again.
where is he?
i don't want to -- do you know where he is?
someone tell me this is really happening.
emil.  take it easy.  stay with me.  sit down.  what do you need?  what are you looking for?
i'm in position, scarecrow.

i will i promise.
you're gonna be okay, toby... you are ... we'll getcha fixed up...
how'd he know about the treasure?
will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance?
it was the mall.
but otherwise it's swell.
i understand -
how'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  get undressed. i want to see you.
won't we? right? am i right?
we know all that, exposition.
you came right to it, son of a bitch --
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
it's a trick.
maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
they're all the same!  they're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  i hate them.
hello...  ...hey denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
you never learn, do you, gittes?
i couldn't make it in time.

you heard about your father?
yoooooow.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
good god.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
because... because -- i mean -- the english have a broad sense of humor, but... i mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  what makes you think they'll listen to you?
angelo, pay attention.  there's gonna be a test afterward.  lab is showing traces of toxins.  pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
there's no call for that kind of language.
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crow-food, tell me why i am going to follow you.
i didn't look like a bum.
does that paper say we've been indicted?  does it say exley's a hero for squealing me and stensland off?
like what?
somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. you've done your job, x, head back to prague. i'll be landing in 90 minutes. this is my operation now.
it's good to be able to hear that.
we could really use some coffee --
but there's still only six of us.
what do you care anyway? you don't even like christine.
i read. i study. because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. respect his body and his mind. quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
bag some z's?
you heard of albert milo. i made that niggah. i'm rene ricard. didn't you read "not about albert milo?" i know who to hype. baby, i'm gonna make you a star.
it's haunted just the same.
i was.  so?  mr. pecharda let me in. as you know, with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. but i left very early, around 6:30.
darling!
this night you shall behold him at our feast; read o'er the volume of young paris' face, and find delight writ there with beauty's pen; this precious book of love, this unbound lover, to beautify him, only lacks a cover: so shall you share all that he doth possess, by having him, making yourself no less.
is this dr. kurtzweil's residence?
want to come to the study group?
it's been a very strange day.
that monstrous god of yours? he strung up his very own son like a side of veal; i shudder to think what he'd do to me.
none at all?
how <u>you</u> doing?
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
geez! you look great!
may i have this dance?
calm down, will ya?  tell me about han.
they're out of glenlivet.
his hatred of the federation is apparent. he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. he is going after earth.
okay, christy -- strip.
you like the ponies?
she is horrible.
i've got to help him.
okay. come on in. looks like you had a bad face lift.
george, i'm afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide. i see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold...
when?
for the church?
the surface ships will be back. after the storm clears.
senator geary, i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  i have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars; why would i ever consider paying more?
consider me ungrateful.
what's that?
look at this.
uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
"pack up your troubles."
goodnight, senator--
prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
the robbers in the bank.  they got guns?

hong kong, mr. bond!

i knew you had juice, but... there's no goddamn bill on me?
jeremiah, what are you doing?
right in there, pal.
you pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
i wonder if you could help me.
i can see that. what are they?
night.
yes... if you have a chart on board, i can show you.
there's one thing i don't understand.  the thing i don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. they viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
i doubt if a few bombs would wake up dawn on a sunday morning.
i trust you, bill.
fine work, pete! you certainly delivered the goods. i'm proud of you.
that was isla nublar. this is isla sorna. the second island.
have you talked to eric?
how?
what's it doing?
college was entertaining, wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, i really think we're going to get to know each...
good morning, mr. killaine. i'm sorry i can't give you the name of my bank--because i have no bank at the moment.  that was a crude trick.
i wasn't bothering you. i was trying to wake you up!
it's one hell of a job.  what do you put on your passport?  profession -- mel gibson's bottom.
what about a summary then.
something else i want to try.
well he's the reform candidate, daddy.
are you?
how much of that letter was on the up and up?
good. -- so our two heroes, adcox and mccaffrey, they go back inside. only there's another fire in there nobody sees. and it took your dad, didn't it brian? did you see him burn?
how did you land that?
look, whatever you want me to do, i'll do.  i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
oh, they weren't that bad.  i mean, they were kind of cute.
charles moore for instants.
of course it counts. how do you play?
well, i've enjoyed it, too.  any... any...<u>any</u> time...  what does the woman want from life...?

spunk, come back...
not long.
nothing yet.
hello--

how do you turn this thing off?
my god, what do you think?
they're not gonna send you right back.
it looked like a fuckin' gun!
isn't this what you like?  they told me you had a thing for boats.
i really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
and, cut...
what the heck are those for?
just an earthquake, dylan.  every once in a while we get a few.
david, do you want me to stay here tonight?
you still gonna play for brazil ?
he's in this somehow... i don't know how.  just stay close to faith.
you don't have to do this. i can look after myself.
you didn’t have to do that.
yeah.
you promised justice.
1989.  six years for you.  there's the sign!  right here!
cenobites. explorers in the further regions of experience. demons to some. angels to others.
sir, i just want you to know... i'm not here to make a statement.  i don't want to make men look foolish. all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, i suspect.
yes, swana, you did.
i'm not talking about does. i'm talking about hookers.
hello ray.
she coulda done better than him.
you may never remember at all. [beat] your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
about that shooting last night...i was there and...
only feeding the disease, eh, martin?
go on... i want to hear everything.
well this is a cozy breakfast.
these guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
mrs. phillips, how long have you known ted kramer?
can't or won't?
right. i was a great athlete. tell her, max, i was the best, i was all schoolyard.
well...
okay, now. but-
let's not fight, hildy. tell you what. you come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
i changed my mind.
i don't think she's real big on hate.
today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
he doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
both.
no one ever noticed?
i'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
what's wrong with you?
see that?  that's just what i'm talking about.
what was he like?
well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
what about juno?
friend ogg.  excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
yes.
a decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
her...
who is it?
impossible.  there's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
i wouldn't have, uh, killed you, father.  dominus ominus. remember, you're bound. you can't talk about this... to anyone.
doesn't it matter to you?
can i come in?
maurice?
i am gale weathers!
you spoil 'em, cliff.
you can't build life like you put together blocks, toddy.
boy, you're really into this.
he missed the door, uncle lex.
the wrench, why?
oh patrick, i can't make this decision.
okay.
oh my god.  i've been so rude.  i'm skye davidson.  has anyone ever told you, you look like peter sellers?
it's all true.
why?
are you cold? would you like a blanket?
what’s the date?
you're a u.s. citizen?
keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
the people i know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. they're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business.
collateral damage.
forget it.  it doesn't matter.
avocado groves?
josie... no, i'm gonna call you sadie.
did you bring me here to sup?
the two of us were the only deputies back then me and buddy--it's what-- '58--
really?  if you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, i will buy you a new cathedral.
pressure?
who the hell is that?
where are you?
i shot at one of them.
what do you suggest, my dear?
i'm running away.
we have to save the world.
stop it, homer. they aren't our rules. we didn't write them. i don't see no reason to read them.
who are you? tall knight we are the knights who say "ni"!
waddaya doing tomorrow night?
i guess mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
well, i hope you'll stay with us.
i ain't trying to get in it.
but professor --
am i... am i dead?
no, sir.  i'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
well... well, how soon would you want them?
yeah, i know, i went back and forth on it.
here... here we are... here you are and here i am... feel it?
my name's edwards...i'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
i know a buyer.  guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
if we run into billy first, let me try and talk him in.
having fun yet?  no?  i'll give you a hint.  remember whatshername?
it's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
a little precaution, sir. i've had traps set for me before now. there are people in central services who'd love to get their hands on harry tuttle.
what do you see here?
we tried!
margo, this is too dangerous.  you always think you can solve everything.  this time you don't have enough information.  the animal might behave in unexpected ways.  leave her here with me.  don't put her in danger.
the world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  look, why not make yourself useful? i'm just about out of smokes.  go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias. 
you talked to him?!  is he mad?  did you tell him?
-- and the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
i don't know anything, i tell you. there's been an accident.
when you lived with the fairfaxes?
don't you have to be somewh...
hey sugar, you lookin' for a date?
if i may make a suggestion... we have different weak spots than you do.  next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect i think you were looking for.
...though.
i thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
it's only ninety seconds up the line. you're on a connection to a trans siberian express.
you do know how to do that, don't you?
thanks, patrick.
...hey, i know what i'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
i thought you were through with it!
and no birds sing.
you told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
john vincennes.  it's three a.m., lad.
my days are not the old days, genius.
always on my ass, anyway.
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ!

007. what do you know of the caspian sea?
captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
i want this ship searched from bow to stern. lieutenant saavik, you are in charge. start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
he thinks you stole his promotion.  what exactly you doin there, john?
i'm always serious.
you got us into this mess.
why is she so desperate to kiss us? i'm betting her lips are poison.
pardon me while i reach for my beads.
you've heard of the national security agency?
you sick?
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
seems exciting.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. i'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
what about his engagement to dyan cannon?
well... it's the men, sir.  they wonder how you know our position. we've lost sight from land days ago...
and what did you say?
oh! the evening before, i see...
sir, i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, i beg you to hear our plea. we are thermians from the klatu nebula.  our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth'h'ar sarris of fatu-krey. sarris wants the omega 13. we are to meet in negotiation. however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. the flames, the death...  please captain, you are our last hope.  we have secured a limousine.
well, that's good. it's about time to eat and you know what i'm cravin'? some of that take out chicken. why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
it's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
if i am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
you're talking crazy! an atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
oh, yes, sir. here it is, sir. the pate de fois gras, sir.
you ever actually been in there, miles?
ben never mentioned it.
we don't like razinin.
mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
i can't do it!
yeah.
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
what do you mean, different?
get your hands off him!  get off...! what the hell do you think you're doing... ? evidence?!  this is a man... !  you killed him!
do you believe in it?
i've been watching you. you couldn't see me, but i could see you. it was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. you would be a very good audience. i can see that.
i'm hurting.
she had the same.
don't take it personally.
yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, craig.  i never thought i'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  but as soon as i got my check, i was gone.  paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
those rat fucks! all of them were all laughing at me man!
i thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
... and by you, mrs. peel. everything points to you.  no sisters?  no undiscovered twin?
finnegan, what the hell was that?
why? didn't al believe my story?
you're looking at him. c'mere and take a look at this beauty.
despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
alabama, could you tell clar -
let's roll.  we got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to doucet. 0800 this morning.
poor dad, does that still bother you?
you will go alone.
let me worry about that, major. i've still got my red line to the air command.
what if the radio stops working?  christ, what if i can't reach you again?
unh-unh, little brother.  i got a natural high.  a supernatural high.
say... god bless america!
dieter?
the prototype appears to be armed, mr. president.  shall i begin evacuation?
how did you get so many?
hi.
yes, yes--tell them i'll see them immediately--immediately!  i can't hold them off! they want something to say about this appointment. ten to one they've got a man.
no time like the present.  the car will bring you.
oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
one thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
you wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
i want to settle this thing and be done with it.  i don't want the archdiocese exposed.
where downstairs?
but, mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
just what you've published.
forgive my indulgence. seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. the point is, mr. odets here has written a wonderful play. most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
a casa de porfirio zayas. he used to be a doctor on the other side. gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
that's different!  what's the matter with you?
yeah, i'm okay -- it's been a long night.
ten days i spent in atlantic city - sonny was frantic - he knew i was drinking; he didn't know where i was ... who i was with.  i couldn't explain why i did the things i did. so i went to this psychiatrist who explained to me i was a woman in a man's body.  so sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  my god, he's in hock up to his ears already.
won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
peoples china bank.
i dreamed that i... that i killed you and danny.
aha, just what i suspected!
if i send out the troops, will you all calm down?
did i know you at princeton, tom? i didn't, did i?
you really got a masters degree?
you better watch your mouth, man, or i'll punch your lights out.
yeah!  yeah!
how much?
can't let you in...  sorry.
cassie, thank christ!  we're under attack.
my sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
children's programming. what did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
i don't believe it.  getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
great, you're here.
austin, may i have a word with you?
shelly would've wanted you to have it.  this way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
the medics are looking all over for you.
we'll send for the police!
oh no.  look -- i like you. i wouldn't keep coming here if i didn't like you.
what's she want?
it's bait.  don't take it.
maybe you can help me. this is bob greer of blaine & edwards publishing company. dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of 'the psychiatrist and the law' to someone. linda never sent me the address and phone number.
how come?  sister?
you ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades, mister.
...his money - steal that, you steal his blood... could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  if we knew where he hid it.  anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  we couldn't hide it anywhere.
damn him! i knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. it was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! when did the bastard die?
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc, wyatt.  i don't know if he's gonna make it.
why not?  i can get you something else.  what do you want?
steve...
well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
yeah, right. who was it: randal?
where did you learn that word?
have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? heh heh, just kidding.
why don't they come to me?
how's it going to look on your report?
i can't say that.
jesus christ. you're going to have to go out the back. the data that you copied with your toy. tomorrow, at six o'clock. look it up. we're taking a trip. be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
to tell you the truth, i'd just about given up waiting.
well, alan, i think we’re gonna have a banner year. sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
with these?
yeah.
you should play with much larger tennis balls. so how's alan?
count me in.
well, try not to get burned. you have a great mind, jacob. don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
no.
confirm with trig and image.
you don't sit with me!!
you could go and open the door.
neighbor!  doctor!  i live across the hall.
well!  aren't we the daring one? what's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door?  the antenna is gone off her car again.  i had no music, all the way to the market.  let me find a garage for it?
yes, sir.  are you acquainted with her?
you sound...ground up...?
you know, daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl.
joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
bunny, ball-ball!  bad bunny!
wait a second. did you say "patricide?"
what is your name? my name is travis.
he wasn't in on it.  you set him off by going to rekall.
so why'd you give up ball?
am i a suspect?
it's cash. and a second passport. if anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? just walk away.
well, if it's a discharge --
he cut along the side of his stomach.  the love handle.
like what?
totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man -- ?
i hope she's all right.  how much more do i have to do of this?
ring it for him, sobo.
wait, erik!
hey, where's the fire, sister?
where's the money hid.
the suit will stretch. you should try it --
bad news?!
nudity has just never been an issue for me, frank.  for me, clothes are just an option.
bob...
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
just get us a couple with big glockenspiels.
what's that supposed to mean?
no, it's true.  i have lung cancer.
again.
okay, thanks.
they got a cuban band that's the berries. why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?

i'm glad you came.
what do they mean by this - "cinderella man!"
send him in.
and make sure you read the footnotes in levinson's class. that's where all her exam questions come from.
hello!
you're crossing the line, mr. nelson.
good!  then you won't be needing your car.
who tripped the alarm?
suppose you listen just for a minute -
no... you came to ask me about hamunaptra.
ahh, that feels great.
nick?
you should play another team. the kings are bitches in this game.
bet you say that to all the girls, perfect tommy.
classic.  absolutely classic. profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
what?  no menthol?
uh...wonderful. i know i'm strange, but in my own way, i love you
i can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  i mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  i mean jimmy and everything.
but i gave her my word. besides, she's still your legal guardian. my hands are tied.
you mean it?
i thought this was an informal meeting. what's he doing here?
he doesn't want to fight.
oh, what?  i offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
you haven't heard from rashid, have you?
come with me to california.
i brought a present for the lady, there.  i'm looking for her, to give her the present...
oh, i wouldn't say that.  you were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
you're only home early because we got you a job, right? and i don't need any heat. you understand?
i'm doing everything i can! -- and stop calling me shirley!
how would you like to go tonight?
we're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit, now do your part
learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  central school of speech and drama. it's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. at seventeen.  they offered her a place at rada n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was jenny.  she could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  show up the old man, you know.
i don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask him yourself?
you'd better sit down, hon.
this is going to do nothing.
don't worry about what we used to be.
warner can't even do his own laundry.
you're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. what's wrong with baseball?
it's o.k...it's o.k...lets me help you up.
are you leaving us?
yes, but you said—
this is no good!
you shouldn't have come.
no, not to me, for me, for the camera.
and the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
i'd love to tell her myself.  when are you going to let me meet her?
what kind of movies do they show there?
i know the facts, mr. kane.  and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  you're a man of great talents, mr. kane.
meaning what?
what is it?
responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what southglen high schoolers have come to call "the court." seventeen-year-old kristen rey says, "yeah, everyone who's anyone is at the court on saturday night."
what?
pete... you okay?
idle hands, the devil's workshop.
and what qualities are those? intelligence or stupidity?
i got an awful bad cold.
are you a resident of california? you gonna fill out forms, man?  do the background check?  go through a three-day waiting period?
in the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. laurels and tube-roses.  oh, think, suzette -- the villa and the sun at tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, suzette.
there's one sure way to find out how you feel.
don't you think it's about time it became important?
what's wrong with it?
war finds me willing. i know it won't bring back all i have lost. but it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. for that we need a king. we need you.
something happened, didn't it?
don't you want to go?
ha!
poor, yeah.
think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? is that still going on?
out of the car.  he jumped out of the god damn car!
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it?
you like it?
wrong!  you haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
commander powell is dead.
we've been through this.
for now.  are you planning to go back to new york?
mr.wallace brown is in the executive building on the second floor. we want to go in and turn right at the first street. then we want to walk three blocks down past stage 17 to the white executive building. once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. now do we have name?
we take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  but there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  not even a scratch.
i was in a car chase and a small explosion. now listen to me: the nsa is behind this. they think that guy i told you about, daniel zavitz, they think zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. so they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. the bank records, the surveillance. they're the ones who broke into the house. now i know there's no reason to believe me. but i love you. and i love our son. so just believe me anyway.  please.
when you get home, i'm asleep. when i leave home, you're asleep.
easy tiger.
want to tell me what went down here?
you're gonna fuckin' kill her. take it easy.
why do you say that?
i want to talk to jimmy.
a gay lot -— redi, for instance.  i don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. she's had to have this to cling to. frances fallon, with her worship of jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. and bruns, the fanatic. and you...
you.
it's just that one of the few things i'm not confused about is what i was saying downstairs, that...
there's porno theatres for that.
i'd get down if i were you. they may be up there now.
i don't know. possibly.
sean, come on out, man. what, you forget your favorite uncle?
everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  you’re making a business deal...
about mr. powell. all of it!
why does she come to you?
what is wrong with you?
"row, row, row your boat..." i love "row..."  do - do you know "row, row, row, row, row your boat?"
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
. . . that was quick.
okay, tiger.  time for bed.
what should i do? call the cops?
we know all that we need to know --
we make them see what we wish.
if you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
oh, now i'll never get home!
and what happened to von der nul?
how long have you known my father?
why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
jesus christ, miles. get out!
honey -- today i am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
welcome to ya. what's your name?
it's dark.
because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
you don't trust me?
how?
i don't follow music much. i'd like to though.  honest.
what?
ah, i see.
what the hell was that?!
i thought you stopped going.
it's him!
i have lost my gift.  it's as if my quill is broken. as if the organ of the imagination has dried up. as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
yeah, it did take me a long time.
please don't make this personal --
worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and i was mad for her. but i knew it was hopeless -- so i decided to end it all. i went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to eden park -- do you know cincinnati?
why not? the whole of the british empire was built on cups of tea.
here what comes?
i've never even met admiral kirk --
whoa. deja vu.
why don't you think so?
why not, against your religion?
jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? impatient...
--a <u>lot</u>.
ah, venice...
clearly.
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
how the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
hey! we gotta talk about this early morning church shit.

listen to me, patrick. i'm leaving.
oh, yeah.
weird, man. no fuckin' electricity. what do you figure they plug all their shit into?
i'm sorry.
where's my gun?
that only leaves three.
it's hong kong, not tokyo.  my country asked for the best.  i told them that was you.  now i will show you around my œhood.
i like your stories.
call bob and reed.  tell them i need them immediately.
and her fiancé!

i'm going to have you disbarred. i'm going to have your ticket. you know what you did?  do you know what you did?
i didn't give any order to fire!
we're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. let's not make it worse. if anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
these people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!

well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave grubbel a job watering their lawns. isn't that wonderful? and then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
i know you. this shari is a passing fancy.
i can answer for this, it was self- defense -- i can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
no difference.
we've touched on this, his own witness has said...
no, more commercial stuff.
well i ain't one of 'em!
are you really carson dyle's brother?
i though we went over this.
there, you see? see?
ya know harry, i think this whole experience has soured me on women.
of course you'll go!  you're going to fly the helicopter.
we're already past it, aren't we, kevin?
i didnít requisition a secretary.

captain, this is saavik. come in, please...
you're pressuring yourself...
i know where he is.
no.
how'd i know it was for you?
good. what else? anything interesting?
that would be beaumont livingston.
-- no, that's okay. it's just sean...
i heard someone pulling in behind the house.  i heard rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  i don't know what they did to her.
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy.
this is this place called ace vintage, you gotta find it, i don't know exactly where this is and i don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. it's a '61 ac cobra that this old guy says is fine, but i need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. so take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then i'll head down there and check it out.
blake?  dead?
yes. i sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. tomorrow we leave for arrakis! arrakis is real. the harkonnens are real.
he has not been home since that day. but she told me where to find him.
every day.  more and more.
brave clarice. will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
father - may i ask you a question in private?
clay could save us an awful lot of time.
you should write something about this.
yes, sir.
hurry.
i don't - 
well, at least it hasn't been boring.
i'm going with you. but we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
i'm not crazy.  don't you tell me i'm crazy.
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. does that mean so little to you, viridiana?
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  all we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
call me.
the lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  dr. wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
what are you doing?
parasite!
watch your back.
wait, wait. i'm trying to figure this out. this is like rona barrett. before you become saved, god already knows who you are?
he commands it whether he exists or not...  look, we can fight him and be crushed. or we can submit.
nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
he's a ghost!
mr. white, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. only ten of us made it back.
could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
i tell you, it was so wonderful. i felt like a little boy. i saw paradise, jezzie.
i wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  anyway, i needed something to do. i was so angry with your brother. he's so... agaanisish!
yeah, a headache.  my head hurts.  you're making me uncomfortable.
......she forgot her purse at my work and i wanted to get it back to her.
sorry. i was just getting something.
i was just being honest.
hello?  oh--hello, mother.
the both of them?  in there?
what do you want from me?  would i swim across an ocean for you?... would i walk across the united states for you?  yes... yes i would.  you know that.
yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
my dad's retired.  he was a private investigator.  forty years.  i used to work for him.
my dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
we can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  i'll fly you over to pasadena.
... but we shouldn't have fired him...
are you kidding? we've put up more of her cousins. you wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
there were so many times i didn't think i could last another day.  i can't even tell you some of the things i thought about.
come on sheila, knock-knock.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
who did?  mrs. feur?
dad!
good luck, sir.
i'd seen you writing in that book. at the embassy in cairo, when i had thumbs and you had a face. and a name.
workin'. pickin' peaches. but i seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so i come out to see what's goin' on. what's it all about?
kiss my booty.
it's our anniversary, panes.
why the hell we drivin' here?
what?  what did he say?
long enough.  fifteen years.
i know.  a purple heart.
there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office.
he feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
he's not the same as when i met him.
sit here, near me. i am an old man and can do no one any harm.
will you please talk to me?
made me sick, but what did i care? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  it was just something i was doing for money.
rita. pass the wine.
sure.  kind of... free-lance.
your eames table is incredible.  and the b&b.  i just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
well, who can tell what went on in there? i never even knew who sethe was or none of her people.
i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?
what exactly is this place? freezers?
besides, i've got to stay here.
richardson won't do that.  he'll resign.
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
you bet, bert.
you're so sweet.
'cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. he doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. he uses you to get a line on ordell, make a case, then take him federal. you know what ordell's into?
easier than learning how to be poor.  my father's family was wealthy. when i was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  and he took his money with him.
you ordering chop suey again?
why do i have to sleep with donnie? he stinks.
check your gun before you leave. they're not allowed in japan.  it's a nice, safe country.
you have to find them, utapan.  look what they did!
yeah? well, listen, ginger's over here at the leaning tower with me.
don't you see?..  we're not the ones who are meant to be.  you're the man of somebody else's dreams.
you what?
must be delayed effects of the drug... i'll get him out of here.
i thought it was well-written. heart-felt.  and a little bit naive... but that's just the enemy's perspective.
here's what you owe me.  one, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? where's ruby?
so help me, gladys.
you must value your independence.
you -- i don't know.
i met him.
i'd love to drive through new england in the fall.
i hear that! see, i knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but i wanted to try -- i thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. my son would grow up here. maybe have one or two more. i'd teach 'em what i could. they'd play with my brother's kids. all grow up together. and even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
i would say that's a very safe assumption.
good samba dancing...?
they're anxiety attacks? that's a little disappointing.
yeah...
such as.
but she couldn't handle it.
gone where?
are you for real?
de moraes? i was asked here by a mrs spitz.
yes! you own the coffer of shadow. nothing can withstand its power.
okay.
just don't tell me you "owe me one."  what file?
jack vincennes.  he's the technical advisor on 'badge of honor,' sir.  he lives for it. that's the way to get him.
take it easy.  everything's all right.  i put it on syphon, on the nose.
hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
yes.
that a fact?
whoa!  whoa!  i'm sorry.  i'm sorry. i don't actually need any right now.
how interesting.
no.
they come when you sleep.
so do i!
we seek to undo the curse.
don't apologize for me.
i just didn't think that i could antagonize him, steve -- for our sake, i mean.
and you like it?
no, i mean, what city, what state are you in?
oh cards, maybe. poker... it's getting cold, sal. i'm going to take you in.  we'll call angela. the guys can help her bring you home... did i tell you i was going on a trip?
in your particular case, miss, i would make some allowance...
i thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
no.
i know you changed it to a bookstore. and the color of my hair.  but the moment was exactly the same.  the same, you know, dynamic.  and almost verbatim, wasn't it?
you're a sucker. i'd have taken that deal.
me too.  great stems, though.
well... it'll probably work out. we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
fine.  so do your count.  start with president, and i'll be right back.
do you need a doctor? i could call robert...
you are seeing it. you're looking right at it.
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram?
i don't have proofs of purchases from snacky smores, kenny!
it's to everyone i really knew -- the first girl i screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- i wanted to tell 'em how much i enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. i gotta let 'em know.
what are you laughing at?
does he ever talk about medicine? his patients, the hospital?
the same reason everyone does.  you hear your name on c-span and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
this is a total catastrastroke. as of this moment i am stumped, i admit, i am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
you smoked because i smoked. we were falling in love, remember? i used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. i wanted to see what you saw.
were any of them prettier than i am?
eight and a half.
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything?
sure, sure charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
he's moving his fingers!
you think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
so how's norman?
yes.
you okay?
-- i don't know the musil district.
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
don’t you believe in simplicity?
what power?
he asked me to marry him.
the truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
yes.
i go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone -
are you really?
wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day.
your name?
meet sylvia. and elloise and sam. and ed. and doreen.
give us things. not just some old flag like this, but –-
you've heard the stories right?
lois!
do you think you have a good memory for faces?
you get lost!
who?
well, i can't make any promises, and of course i haven't read the script but i loved the novel...when are you shooting?
on screen.
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what i mean.  i wonder if it still works this way.
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her.
this. and the gas.
with grenadine, right?
anything....you call us right away. you got that?
look, baby - i don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. i just know it is. so, what d'you say?
you know they invented something while you were inside.  called a watch.
nothing much. i just think he's a fake, that's all.
he is to a lot of people.
because i know you. you prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
well, yeah, that's part of it. woman finds out how i live, that i'm not a published author, that i'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. if you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. you're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
of course not. please.
told you, i'm superstitious.
you'll have to prove it.  this is a great brownie and i'm going to fight for it.  state your claim.
put it this way, he's mislaid him.
but you've had beautiful country all around you. you've just had to life up your eyes!
it was rummy, not poker. but i'll take a chance and let you in.
screw lucy!
i lowered the drinking age to ten.
you take care of paulie?
look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, i warmed it up -- _ 74.
yeah, but not in here.
good grades. fine athlete. president of his class.
damn that charlie i
it's pretty old.
hi, mickey ...
you're saying that brown & williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
he can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  did you give him an approval?
i don't see how.
joe could help him. if we can get in touch with joe, joe could get him to a doctor, joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
you're full of ifs.
know something? you're a workaholic. a good guy 24 hours a day. stop and smell the roses sometime. take up a hobby. get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
yes.  would you care for another one?
eddie?
kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
it's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
do you have ulcers?
what i'd like to do---
yes... i... we had dinner.
natasha, maria, tina-
i'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, nancy. but you can't forgive for liz.  no one can.  and you can't forgive for me.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
bernie -- this is anna.
what about when she goes out?
i'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. medicine. law.
milo?
you're next, norman.
no, that's not him...
yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. after the rains.  look good as new.
judy, it can't make much difference to you. i just want to see how you'd look and i know it won't be the same, but --
toadies right behind.
how could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
fletch!
yes.  bit of a shock.  but as cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  and since i've been here since the mesozoic era --
good morning, father. it's hard on the feet, huh?
all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin' coffee.
don't be so amazed. it's a very ordinary matter. i'm jacqueline's physician... mr. ward told me you were in town and jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family.
we're not coming out.  we're not letting you in.  get out of my house. 
our john doe! the one i made up! look, genius— now, look. suppose there was a john doe—and he walked into this office. what would you do? find him a job and forget about the whole business, i suppose! not me! i'd have made a deal with him!
so many of them -- i still can't believe they're real.
how much do you make a week?
--we will--
come one, what's wrong?
every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  odorless. undetectable by dogs.  undetectable by anyone.
motherfuckers...
unrile yourself, stamp. it's only a few days he been there.
who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
do you, uh, know...
how'd you unlock my phone?
i'll try to slip out. if he quiets down, passes out... i'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, barton. he becomes irrational–
you make me nervous! i always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
you know me with girls. easy come, easy go. goodbye, doc.
you want to know something? take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
i'm sending.  do you hear me?
medallions.
yeah, right...
i’ve got kids, i’m going home...
where in hell meyerling dig you up?
oh - i've found plums.  we have plums in the orchard.  we have an orchard! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
...what?
all right.  now that you explain it i see that you're right.
i was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, i'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
can't shake him.
i had to tell 'em something.
you would do that?
so what's the plan?
they're given to the living in memory of the dead.  if this is a real one -- i can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
we've got to keep moving while there's still light.
good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. unkillable.  but now i believe that is going to change.
so, wait, what are we dropping off?
i need you to stake me. i can't do it without it. it's just a couple hundred grand. taken out of our cut when we're done.
tell me what you saw tonight. tell me.
he was.
no.
we almost slept together... and... then the hair started and i booked.
hit me in the chest with this...
wait a minute, walter. you can't do that!
well, fact or not, i don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  i can't see a thing!  let's turn back.
we're fucked, i know --
what are you doing here?
anybody says anything bad about millie, i'll break his neck.
it doesn't make sense.  she didn't know me three months ago.
i think i'm stupid.....all you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
thanks.  it was my idea.
this is betty at twelve.
tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
you said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. what guy?
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on, the waste - i'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away.
so who you taking to the prom?
why did you interrupt?  maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
okay.  but what if i'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  to smell a flower?
i said i just wanted to talk to you...
you're not tired of it?
the judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
book five, deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "but this shall you deal with them.  you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
oh, i don't mind. as a matter of fact, i'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
that's wonderful.  poor josephine.
well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  but get the kid back here. she wants to come back. that's the, uh, that's the main thing here. you want your kid, don't you? huh?
i think that we should spend some time apart.
and you're going to fall for them.
you'll pick up the middle on this one - the jews and negros.
yes. i'd considered it.
you coming, boone?
who?
scott my boy, come here. how was your day?
i made no such promise.  sound the retreat for the night!
you didn't want to see me, did you?
about what?
you're exactly right, andy. i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm. and now i'm counting on your assistance too.
two hours... tell me, will evelyn be there as well?
fortunately, they did.
mr. shermin, i'm hanging up now. if you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. i'm in the book.
why?
alright. this is your penance. say two rosaries and... be careful, loretta. reflect on your life.
you an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. we're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. if anybody says to come dance--why i'll say you're poorly. but you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
tell him i have a fiancée, dickie has a fiancée and freddie miles probably had a string of them.
you should look into private schools.
if you'd gone on about how much you liked it, i'm not sure i'd have believed you.
i'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. that's state time. prison.
josé doesn't like the deal in south florida...
fall in love.
because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
i said, how ya feelin'?
i'm not hungry, oddly.
keep talking, i'll find you!
my father's guilty.  he lied to me, he lied to everybody.  i just left home... i need you.
oooh, the mainland --
it would help me if we were.
i guess so. like you said. it's a strange world.
what?
chicago.
nothing?
this is great - great!  now we have to enter the front door!
hiya.
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue. a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. the civilian does not.
you don't look like you.
here's your twenty-five hundred, mr. brett.
so if we do his job, we're the bad guys. if we do our job, we're the good guys.
...they sound what?
oh.
not the way you’re thinking. the women wanted me there for support. you can understand that.
burke.
i mean, do you have something i could show my manager? i mean, do you have a reel?
calls?
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
my kid brother has one.  you know why?
besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess i'm dealing with.
i have brought you trouble. maybe i should have come alone.
did you get it?
will you do something for me?
what happened?
i'm sorry.  i, we
what have i done?
my name's frank. and furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
-- please, baby --
this isn't our area. whose area is this --
goodbye, judy.  take it easy.
open?
what have you ordered?
but he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
what if he doesn't like me?
dimmy, you worry for something?
hey, rocco, wait. come back here.
hi, i'm rhonda.  rhonda lebeck. i'm up here for the semester...
if you wanna hit "ramrod," take your shot. take some pride in it. you go to church? so fuckin' what, god loves you. i mean, christ. a guy as well known as you? by the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house sunday nights you probably look like "inspector cluseau."
he called you "macleod".
who's ryan cooper?
i have to have jackie ask me? don't you think you could call me and let me know? look at my hair.
what?
you'll catch cold. it's cold.  what do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
as if you care.  i saved your life, peck.  those guys woulda killed us!  you wanna give your baby to them?? they eat babies!
hmph!  they sure didn't give andy much to do.
you believe this, don't you? that you're a vampire? you really think...
donnie darko is a cool name. sounds like a superhero.
the attacks are unceasing: by night, the dark ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the slayers.
that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election. getting everybody all riled up like that.  she's finished, you hear me? washed up.
so could you!  is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
...and have you ever met david ferrie?
he's right. you'd feel much better about it.
which one's which?
you know, bob, anthony did kill someone. he electrocuted our janitor senior year.
i'm with you kid.
well, i was almost born here. it took place in that wild country beyond the pass. my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. when chang found us, only father and i were alive. but he was too weak to climb the pass. he died on the way. i was brought up here by father perrault himself.
hmm. i guess that doesn't help... i see where you're going here. it's a mess.
so what's my share of the dress?
stolen! what are you trying to do to me? ... you're working with the police! ... you're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! you're trying ...
shit! this is too much!  chief, i tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to canada before they know what bit 'em.
no.
don't be frightened.  do you think i'd make my sister a widow?  do you think i'd make your children fatherless?  after all, i'm godfather to your son.  no, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  i'm putting you on a plane to vegas--and i want you to stay there.  i'll send connie an allowance, that's all. but don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  who approached you, tattaglia or barzini?
same old stuff.  i'm watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
sir. i was going mach point one five.
she wants to quit?
[that he used policemen. that you killed them, it made it a police matter. the ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
what case?
bobby?
it gets interesting if it was haldeman, because our word is that when chapin says something, he's gotten the ok from haldeman, and when haldeman says something, he's gotten the ok from the president.
my god! this is way over your head, pal. we need to call some experts and . . .
say, boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie.  him and charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
what works?
so, how did your conference go with gordon?
thanks.
look, why get into this again. as long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  it's been nice so far.  we're together --
i'm on it.
racist piece of shit.
what would you say, too fast...too quick...
i still don't.
ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
momma... are they angry with us.
he's right.
you've killed but you're not a killer
doctor rumack, mister hammen ate fish. and randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
how many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
yes. they give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. days are going by, senator. days--weeks. finally, they think it's quite a bill. it goes over to the house of representatives for debate and a vote. *but* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
take a walk, pal.
... you will join us for dinner, won't you, mr. gardiner?
which you pulled, hard!
i'm josephine.  sax.
now we're on the right track... put back "dear"... how does it read?
oh!
uh, i think there's been a mistake. i didn't save that woman.
charlie, that's mean. come on in, ted. don't listen to mr. wise guy here. he's a joke a minute.
i promised i'd go right home after school.
i will close.
high-grade det cord. this girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
i'm sam helburn. sam.
hello?
give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  what do we pay mookie for?  he don't even work.  i work harder than him and i'm your own son.
the porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left new york.
but the hessians are there!  no one can beat them!  that's why cornwallis stationed them there! they have the post of honor!  they are invincible!
don't worry. he was white trash, they come at two a penny. i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
you're an artist, wladek, you keep people's spirits up. you do enough.
define your terms.
that’s every man within a five mile radius.  including you.  that’s why you’re here, isn’t it? you think i can’t do it. you think i’m going to screw up. or get myself killed.
i've been following this guy for years. i'm your best shot.
well, then i've got good news for you. we just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the mall of america today. i'm sending esther to meet you there at once.
make that sixty and i'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
level with me, eddie. you ever play billiards before?
spa?
are you serious?
right here.  right here.  <u>inside</u> the magician.  shhhh.
mr. sheldrake?
i'll have to take the chance. try to get them all into that molecule chamber. it takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. now if you could . . .
yo, paulie.
i've got to stop.
i hate him.
all right, i'll work on it, i'll, do some research. but in the meantime, don't get crazy.
it's a sin to be fat.
you're julia, right?
your mother, and your father
would you like to learn them?
i lothe them! i can't stand the sight of them! stupid bourgeois parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! i've searched for them the world over and i despise them!
what happened?
well, that's okay, i just -
done!
of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  and pricks.  hard, arrogant pricks --
jesus, look at this guy.
it's getting kind of late --
mr. desmond!  arthur neff.  area rep for the federal assistance plan.  tell the boys in dc to keep those goodies coming.
let him try it.
is this whitemail?
it's good to see you.
this can't be right.  this isn't a sorceress.  this is some kind of animal.
we bury the body. we disappear into the woods. nobody knows.
tell me about your husband, mrs tasker.
we just want --
the floor has a nice shine to it.  oh god -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
what? a black ship?  where?  a black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
so i hear.
well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
i really can't talk now--
what is it, betty?
but no intention of selling them. one would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
lady...
go to the symphony --
you haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
maybe, yeah.  hell, i don't know.
you're too good to me.
pelting down out there.
oh, in there? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo. i guess, if nobody noticed, it's ok. mr crane, this is tony, a friend of mine. tony, mr crane.
well, maybe we should talk ab...
what have we done to hurt you?  and don't deny it, i can smell an ex-catholic a mile away. what did we do?  burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? that was in the days when the church was a ruling body. we let governments do those things today. so what did we do to you eh?  you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
hell, what am i holding back for? why don't you just give me everything you got here?
oh...
i been working on a few things.
did she know where nix was buried?
i didn't. mother did.
out directing the search for the traitors.
but the power source, zaltar.
bob's in a hurry.
because i'm in love with you.
i do not want your worlds or your slaves.
...a mindless barbarian. not a king like you, m'lord.
i'll do this for you.  fifteen thousand dollars.
i don't like that word much, carter.
well?
do you like talk like that?
all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.
it looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
was jack goodman your good friend?
you're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
<u>do</u> it...
but they're certainly dead. and yes, personally, i find it a bit odd.
i don't have time to go upstairs.  the police are looking for me.  i need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
are you really a virgin?
no.
oh god! you don't know? casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night.
i'm kidding. i'd really love to, ted, but the thing is i already have plans. how about tomorrow night?
i can't relax.
by the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  you coming?
he's going to have you the rest of his life, hildy. can't you give me another hour?
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
your pen palls dead, lady.
it's not my store.
say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in fargo?
i take it back - you're fucking deranged... and you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
nothing is real until it's perceived.
what?
are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
it's not his job -- it's my job!
puerto rican rum. see for yourself.
yeah, it's true. you do look like a boxer. john garfield, in body and soul. exactly john garfield anyone told you that father?
sure is pretty.
-- how we doing?
maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. you can't trust anybody in this crazy world. say, i'll bet i could shoot you from here.
oh, make that uniform blue.
so, we've got to come up with our movie. our biography.
honk at him. scare him.
what are you saying?
going out on the 'aurora.'
he was such a good-natured kid... always going out of his way....
how's your leg?
it's not our affair.  even if wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
the doctors were not negligent.
to what do i owe this extreme pleasure, sir? anything wrong, sir? deltoid "playfully" grabs alex's hair.
i heard that.
skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
damn, she musta hot wired it. we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton-john!
you think so?
so if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  but things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
ok. what's in the parcel?
no, if i go out on this job, then it's just another score by mr. henry. and i don't see it like that. this is your job. your creation. i want you to try this.
excuse me? do i know you, friend? take a look around you. do you even know who i am?
so don't show a picture.
come on. at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
a previous witness stated that she saw miss lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on october twenty-eighth.  according to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
there isn't enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy. 
the skeletal structure is completely normal.  same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
i can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  so <u>simple</u>.  say my name three times. that's all.  i'll be all yours. then i'll bring you over here in style.
which hospital?
creasy...  i'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
you know that's what it is.  mrs. watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
my parents won't be back till ten.
they don't scare me any more.
i'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
well... it's possible they think my name's bobby.
hey, lizzy. i need to talk to you for a second.
i've got 'im, joe. be right along.
i just thought i'd drop by and show you a photograph.
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal?
the organization wants to make a change...now that nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
uh-huh... so, what'd you talk about?
can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
how sad. stuffed and mounted, eh? dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. and his other companion?
oh, no.
how much we got left, honey?
why are they after you?
she took the baby in her arms?
that must be raoul!  raoul!  look, d'artagnan's come to visit...! what's wrong?  you look awful!
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something. and i said, you were cute when you were little.
yes, there is something wrong. people who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
are you busy?
i know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
no more stalling, captain.
oh, okay. i think i get it.
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop. i was a careful child and i became a careful adult, but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
he's got great hands.
but what about the other night? we were like two stars in the same constellation.
what question?
i didn't ask for any help. did you, linda?
assets are anything of value a company owns.  sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  by selling them off, i make a profit.
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
that's good.
what do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
have you gotten us a room yet?
hey.  you.  mr. coma.
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein. the love affair that shocked europe! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican! never has the screen dared...
that's right -- premature ejection.
what is that thing?
they think i'll make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
i don't think you should have given up the piano. i will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
with this thing! i'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
what does it matter? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. they want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  and then they dump you.
what is it?
you're late.
oh -- you don't have to go to miser stevens while i'm around.
what is going on here, satch?  what are those guys doing out there?
i'm sorry, sir, we're not allowed...
come on, cohaagen!  you got what you want.  give these people air!
and there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
her name is kristen. she disappeared a couple of months ago.
what'd you say?
do something.
she's a precog?
yeah!  that's it.  i don't know.  maybe it wasn't.  i gotta go.
all right, martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
which way?
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle?  jesus, man. it couldn't have worked out better. they're convinced kelly whacked suzie. i can't talk 'em out of it.  we should be celebrating.  this thing worked out just like you said, only better.
we're still drifting.
what was that?  did you hear that?
what was it like?
he's blunt, but he's got a point.
no.
you didn't say serial killer and i didn't say serial killer.
i don't know.
this must be, at long last, our formal introduction. until now we have met only in passing...
hello, wyatt!  hiya doc!
all the time!  i don't know what gets into me--but i keep looking for trouble and i always--i swear you better lock me up.  i'm going to smash somebody--i know it.
i'm dying to hear of his reaction. the thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
well...uh...
er ... i assure you mrs buttle, the ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. if you have any complaints which you'd like to make, i'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
i' ll be honest with you, kid. a grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar d-k-fucking-n-y suit, cooler than an eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? first thing i have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? you tried it once.
nice?
be more specific.
yeah?
can't you stay with us a little?
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone.
rose. rose dewitt bukater.
i shouldn't wonder. not a woman inside boodles since --
i don't want to wake. i want to stay with you.
where is my rascal, lazlo?
to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes.
i love rosebud, i am wild about rosebud. i just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. we have growing children in the house.
i always have a couple on the hook.  you know.  there's one right now, i've got her panting like a dog.  it's great.
i sure don't hate you.
a couple of peons for the mob and...
can't you use something else?
i'll provide you with transportation.
it still doesn't mean...
he could indeed, mr lombard. but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it.
two.  gabriel and thomas.
that's a laugh, mrs. robinson. that's really a laugh. ha ha.
why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
jersey?  you know what the traffic's gonna be like?
it's got a lot of good things.  of course, it would be an expensive picture...
the scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. then you can travel -- i'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
mr. kane, this is a surprise!
sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
and don't get too logical, driscoll. in police business it doesn't work. i wish it did.  but it doesn't
no, sir. but it wasn't easy... being among them...
don't start... the only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  i just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
what happened?
look.
alright.
yes?
okay, sounds like you're all set. just clean the pipes and it's a go.
where's that airlines bag?
i think you could be an actor. i know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
at least i'll have company when i die.  ain't that right, jake?
the financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
looks like he missed ya.
looka that! two of them. oh my...
as ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
and flash isn't?
reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
you're back, boychick.
no, he was a schoolteacher. but he liked to dabble.
get control of yourself!
well, i don't have any money . . .
yes.
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
we've got a lot of work to do.
that's wonderful.  where did you ever learn it?
thanks a lot. i always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
can i take you to the airport?
i don't know.
this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  in fact what we -- the church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god, as she claims.  you understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse god's name in this manner...
i just started it.
you're twisted.
nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
i meant on my grandmother's grave. don't be so technical, hildy. what's the story?!
dr. crowe.
okay, let's get you wired up.  i hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
honey?
you work for ryuji?
what?
you think i'm dumb. you think all models are dumb.
not if you're over sixteen.
yes, i think so. just about then.
get out of this room and get back to work.
kiss me once, amy! kiss me once for luck!
let's all make a vow. let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
strip down a nun?  you want us to fry?
i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here. you haven't seen it, have you?
i'm worn out.
i've never been here before. i wonder whom you're thinking of. oh, i know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. today... now this might shock you... i went up to a taxi and said "eight rue du bois"... and here i am.
jimmy? jimmy? i don't know how to take this. and what do you mean, jimmy? i thought you said you and your husband --
not curtis.
cunt. scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
that's the way it is.
must be your lucky day then. i’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
no.  i haven't noticed because i make my payments.  so, max pelcher, how's the p.i. business?
under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. we call it "plasma" - i do not know the klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
excuse me?
i've been backpacking.
009843... 42... 41!  we're in alignment!
he's not madison?
you?
did he just say what i think he said?
if that ain't the truth.  and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat...thank you, fred.
it's gone now.
jesus, kid.  let me guess. real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
it's not a contest.
sorry, that's classified.  i don't really have a clue who you are... you wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
it's okay, eugene.
you owe me twenty cents. come on, seven-twenty. seven-twenty.
but you're not going anywhere, are you?
four passenger, single engine cessna.
alright, henry -- we're gonna go your way.  crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss!
we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
hy-brasil?
it would make sense. mcconnell hates me. i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
and your father? is he from new york?
i reckon i don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. i don't know how to go about it.
future man would never go to jail for you, i'll tell you that.
sure, an' i'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the champ. he's just there to help condition the man.
creasy?
even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
what do you mean you and my father decided? who the hell are you to plan my life? let's get married and live happily ever after. bullshit. i got knocked up. i had to marry you. i never had a choice.
she's an aristocrat's daughter. she's not one of us.  in any case, it will all be over soon.  you'll kill fox, and she'll marry.
should i just ask your girlfriend?  maybe i should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
now, he's really pissed.
you know how to work this thing?
you were saying --?
what do you think?
does it float?
zachory ! my boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
mr. cedar!
go sit next to him.
well -- i could try. do you wash your hair every day?
n... no,  i just did the ink spots.
liz is taking care of him.  the doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
i'm in a mess today, too.  i'm thinking about doing it with mike. what do you think?
you said that two weeks ago.
don, this is my mother.  mom, this is my boss, don palmer.
you haven't finished your beer.
my god you look exactly like him.
thought maybe sparky and buddy'd taken ya. come on, i'll drive.
you wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
help me with this guy.
look, i'm in here.  you call this a career move?
all right, take your hoop and bowl.
hello.
can i ask you something?
he'll tell me when he gets home.
how did you - ?
tell me, gordon--when does it all end? how many yachts can you waterski behind? how much is enough?
here.
then it's god, right?
on the high seas, your ship attacked, and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners.
i know.
do you know, eve - sometimes i think you keep things from me.
where?
captain, i hope i don't have to remind you --
you'd think they'd build the parking lot of america to go with the mall of america!
where should i look then, cole?
just erich.
but richardson?
just take my work for it.
i don't need any new ties. i've got another tie - i've got another one besides this one. and it's a pip, too. there's only one thing wrong with it. you know what that is?  it has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. of course that's only in its weaker moments. when you move down to my place, i'll show it to you.
well, the last time i was up here, that's where i sat. i sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. i'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. then i began to cry, and i had to get up and go home.
is she...?
now? i don't think so. but i've met him, of course, and we've chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r.
quiet today?
what for?
you little fuck.
to be on the safe side.  i mean --
what was that?
what, do you like it here?
you're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
how long have you been with him?
but i'll tell you something, what i said in their, still goes. you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
no, see, neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
nah...  with you, i mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
walter --
colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  say george, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
i'll bring it back as soon as i can.
well, i am a dead man and buggered to boot. my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of england, while burbage and the chamberlain's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
had?
no. i must deactivate you.
it's a pretty rare quality these days.
franks and beans!
yeah, jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
no, three. who said there were four?
altar boys?
sure plenty of times.
who is "us?"
there are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  i've seen you before.  sister...?
mind if i turn on some heat?
aces full.
what care the bones when the soul is free?
it's a beautiful picture of her.
do you think it goes all the way across?
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but i hardly think...
i haven't been using it recently leslie
just tell me what's really going on.  i think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
what is it?
so i just take your word?
sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. it's time you got some ambition.
as i recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the district ten years ago.
bullshit.  getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  besides, we do have a choice.
yessuh.  joseph knights printshop. vacant for thirty years.
did you hear that mr. de santis? everyone's really crazy about dead cat.
what was i supposed to do?  when you didn't show up saturday, i tried to call. your phone isn't working.
listen to you...  the old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
where'd johnny find you?
twins, max. sixteen-year-olds. can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
i thought i might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
ah!  this is very exciting.
you and who else?
good a way to kill time as any... she okay?
i can't get hold of him. he's in europe.
i love my blender.
my change.
deputy, have you made any id's?
a lab and equipment.
yo, teach, what the fuck?
what is this?
and here i was thinking you were such a nice guy.
do you care?
you ought to watch it with that shit, suzie.  you get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
but you won't listen.  you won't see me, you won't see anyone.  what would you like me to tell jamie? that uncle alex is busy?  that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. he left everything to us. he traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. you should do the same thing, mr. deeds.
if i licked him i would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, i was ready that night.
what did she do to me?
marriage can really complicate things. so, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
what cowardice!  what treason! joseph has ruined everything.  how could they all lose their heads. they knew i was coming up fast. victory was just within grasp. come, come, turn your troops around, general belliard.
leave me alone!  i don't ever want to see you again!
no, i know. i'm just saying. i feel fine. you want a piece of cake?
gawd...you're...beautiful...
i'm not ready to die.
loretta...sidney falco...
frank!  no, frank!  frank!
just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. come on, this is a joke! assault and battery? i barely touched that bitch!
you want to go?
it must be my new shampoo.
... and when i realized our area's just as bad as hinkley, i thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  so i went and asked.
absolutely.  and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall.
what we need is a space for real performance art. a cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
god smiled upon us.
the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. that was death's original design.
i'll go with you.
is that where they say it came from... ?
tell me about it.
i'll get the book.
it's getting dark and cold. i'm tired.
well, we didn't know --
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
why is it taking so long?
now, listen! you never arrived here with this -- reprieve. get it?
  all right.
but if it does.
okay.
no! tell me everything, jimmy.
yes. not my department ... i'm only records. it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval. i don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose we're all human.
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
i -- i want to say...
if there ever was a devil in this county, ike, you is it!
...and here is the key to the mini- bar. room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
did you hear what i said, miss kubelik? i absolutely adore you.
chloe's dead.
it's fucked up.  i'm sorry...
the numbers stop at 107.
i wouldn't take no cheap shots. i'd be a good sparrin' partner.
happy birthday adele.
come on -- come on --
please.  don't humiliate me further.
117  continued:  
you're very macabre.
a simple reason, mccoy. the obvious reason. to rob a bank.
what about yours?
some people do it for for improvement
yes. do you want...
i don't understand...
oh, he was dying for years.
excuse me, i hope i am not a disturbance, don corleone.
put that back.
i found it!
and dogged when i set my mind to something.
you know our two most senior senators:  gaius cantus and falco verus?
why?
you can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier.
wrap it around that rock twice.
there you go, preacher man. get me drunk so i don't stick my foot up yo ass.
i know, son.  but you'll like it where we're going.  i'm getting a good job.  it's a pretty part of the country.
i'm so sorry, i didn't notice much.
just admit you're wrong.
yes, i know.
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  it's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the invisible girl.
you guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>you</u> were seen burning them.  add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
if... we have trouble.  what about the guy in the flyer?  betelge...
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
they're not cong.
do you need me anymore?  cause i'm going to bed.  they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but i gotta try to get some sleep.
tell you what.  i'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
it's nothing personal, george.  just business.
my daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  put her on your squad and i'll give you the guns.
yeah. fitful dreams.
let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
ok, but then i agree with tessio. you're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the corleones...
she up for this?
what's that big black scar on the ground? like a fire.
continental casualty...
daddy?
practice ran late. i'm on my way.
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr. bertrand's mouthwash? i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
your name, please.
those mountains? are they?
skipper, sorry to bother you.
you were real resourceful out there.  got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  so he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  gets along better than ever.  yeah, maybe i underestimated you.
who the fuck knows? musta slipped or something. i just heard the gun go off.
that's on time for margo.
it was one year ago...
mmm.  well, good luck, miss daniels.
what's wrong with approval?  you admired that man.
i will make that recommendation to the president.  i must tell you in all honesty that i'm extremely dubious about the results.
it's an art book.
to tell you the truth...i'm excited.
sarah, order a chopper. i want the next thing smoking and i don't care whose. ours. dcpd.  or the marines. then call documents. tell them to scramble a team. i want everybody moving in five minutes.  dr. chilton, please do not handle the note. i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
hit him again.
they made me put my hat back on.
the test isn't one hundred percent accurate. you should...
shave?  at a time like this?  those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
no, sir.
they were enemies.  we were at war.
time travel... they're attempting time travel...  full power, mister data. worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
julia?
i got a name - sal boca, brooklyn.
for the inner satisfaction it will bring.  saturday mornings, i'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
if i were sitting where i normally sit, i would say "calls for speculation."
you got a beer?
you know alfred.  he'd never say anything.  but i can tell.  until you came along, alfred was the only family i ever had.  without him, i don't know how i would have survived.  he saved my life, dick.  and i've never told him.
cock-suckin' right i do!!  in the gun lockers!
go on ahead... close the hatch!
how soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
your name's harlan?  i got an uncle named harlan!
just what i told you.
mmm.
but i could be anybody.
where's dad?
his mother - we need her approval.  but i'm not worried - because i don't smoke.
hey!
i made my bones on the street, you know. i did riglioni in his own house. i was made in the family, okay.
oh!
you're tough, all right.
rico, you're acting sergeant now. my last sergeant lost the com pack. put together a search team and find the radio shack. we need retrieval.
you're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. maybe you've just got powers of precognition. well, maybe you're just out of whack.
i can use johnnie's car, dump it in lake michigan ...  i need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
it's all this moving from place to place.  we're never settled.  i'm having nightmares myself.
why are you a fuck?  'cause you got talent.  i got brains.  but you got talent! you're god damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  all my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
see what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
the word is mob.
shoot.
you seem to know a lot about him.
whoa. some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. i'm a brewski man myself.
it's the truth.
what'd i tell you?
you hear me talkin' to you.  the only time you come up here when something is wrong.
we've been together too long.  his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
what color hair does he have?
she's no vampire.
oh thanks, it was nothing...
i don't know.
you suspected all along, suspected he was alive. that's why you came to el paso.
is it clear?!
nick, what are you talking about?
what did you say?
hello?
you think someone else caused the accident?
call it an expression of trust.
well, i have a pat rebuttal for mr. doyle -- that couldn't be mrs. thorwald -- or i don't know women.
she was damaged and unstable.  the more i tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  finally, she showed up at the new house...
who's whiskey dick?
what is it?
mcginty's.
sorry to bother you, sir. i have some rather distressing news about master dick.
i know that now. he's a fucking psycho.
well...i used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  lately i'm not so sure.
use the bathroom.
yes, chuck?
tit for tat--as simple as that.
this -- bob hope or the like --
fuck you.
you sure?
they crashed it into a wall.  a flight <i>simulator</i>.
rizzo?!
what's happening?
all three -- in chronological order.
i don't care if i never get home.
sylvan? no; i snowballed him.
you a good pool player.
so how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
i know, but it wasn't all bad was it? i think you found it quite pleasurable.  oh so soft.  so sensual.
hey, you!
how ya doin', ronald. staying comfortable?
enrique! quienes son estos? how could you bring them here?
something like that.
we took all the chances. the money belongs to us, not him!
y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the army sent.
yes. we knew him, of course, by his real name.
tom isn't going to sit in with us, johnny.  he only handles specific areas of the family business.  tom?
marco's sister. can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... you gotta have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical
but i never know when you're working and when you're not working!
what's the difference?
what?
who tied her down?  you or him?
no...
where were you last night?
we mustn't let him land!
one more time.
yes.
yeah.
what's up, walter?
why then, o brawling love, o loving hate, o anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. serious vanity. misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
some chance at ten percent a week! and if he don't borrow, he don't work.
oh, he's very goad, sir. i've read quite a few of his books.
got it.
this looks promising .. i think this one could be it?
i can't.  if i had a minute to think, maybe, but i know you're wrong.
come on, let's go! let's get out of here!
i looked for you in my closet tonight.  it's crazy, i don't know where you came from, but i like you.
right. friday night is yankee night. where're you from?
does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
you gave the orders!
oh, thank you lord!  i'm so glad to see you!  i need to confess... i haven't been confessed since easter... or been to mass... will you hear me now?
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
no —- not yet.
want me to imitate a stupid cop?
no.  you just described every great success story.  alright, it's alright.
do you know where we are?
just like i always promised.  now you're among the immortals.  you're movie stars.
no.
yes.
oh, brother.
well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still could.
there is "undercover."  and there is "which way is up?"
and you told mom today?
have you ever made it with a girl?
they money will be standard bank transfer.  we believe we will know where and when.
i'm twelve.
well, i hope you know what you're in for. i'm a very dangerous person. someone does me bad like you. if i caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead ratso long about now. hear?
oh jesus, sheriff, i am sorry. i meant to call you -- i got distracted -- the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims. that's the good news.
make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
rose calvert.
some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! american soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
okay... on what?
i don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
i'm sorry. i'm not sure i understand. you wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
do you like to play football?
how are you at math?  i was hired for five hits.  i did four.
we'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  but on every guard's chest,they left one marlboro cigarette.  just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
you're a bad loser.
my dog!
what? what do you stand for?
yes?  hello, mr. mayor.  nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  it's the mayor, he's saying...
yeah, they're in the snow.
how are you doing.
in the physical sense.
i'll relay this to ciiac.
tequila.  from your drug dealer friend.
it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
yeah. wouldn't be no picnic for you. i ain't exactly housebroken.
a parting gift from the empire.
god!  it looks like the army!
whose car?
but, to someone from the planet krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. kryptonite! ah, kryptonite! that's the stuff!
yeah.
you got it?
a dollar sixty! . . . you had four dollars last night! how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you're going?
now what do we do?
this is the hotel san domenico?
just in case someone gets a shot off.
okay.
naw! that's science fiction stuff!
hmm.
jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.
well, shit. that don't mean you gotta confirm it!
yes, my bag!
don't get your hopes up.
i'm still on anti-biotics, i really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...gosh, i've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. never one like this. for one, i wasn't a mutant. secondly, i...what are you thinking?
none of your business.
hey, you guys are milking that job.
obviously.
what do i tell my mama when i get home? i didn't find him and that's what i wanted to do.
was she ever a suspect?
back to california
what happened?
you son of a bitch. you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
yeah.
any casualties?
what about rehearsal?
good woman.  i trained her right.
i did?
all right.
you were right.  there's a part of him that knows the truth.  about what he did, about himself.
i like enthusiasm.  that's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
howdy, miz lampert.
now?
so this...foam you found in the lungs.  how does it get there?
i have no idea.  i've never heard of him.  but i'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
well, we gotta dig him up again.
yes!
sharp shirt, jake....
no thanks.  how do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
these things are wild...  what do you think?
i miss him.  you know, sometimes i wake up in the morning, and i think 'i have to make frank's breakfast,' and i... i get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, i remember.  i miss talking to him.  cathy's a child, you know, and mitch...  ...mitch has his own life.  i'm glad he stayed here today. i feel safer with him here. 
i'm sorry.
no.  i don't scare easy.
this is good work, x, damn fine work. you need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "ahab".
is this boyfriend bothering you?
what has happened?
naw, you didn't let me down.  it was a long shot all the way.  we gave 'em a good run at it.
make the pizza.  i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
you notice anything with mikey lately? the kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
well... mostly...
i don't know if i want to be doing this.
bad and illegal behavior. that's what i mean. ok?  mischief.  now have you been doin' some drugs today?
hand rolled.
here's ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone. get it?  they're korean, so they're pretty hot.
you like kids?
we have to have a plan.
the book without pages. open before you, all around us. you can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
you need to go.
someone from the office.
sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister. is that true?
yep, it's all yours.
oh really?  we're they `us'es' or `them's'?
let's just declare war on the hellhole.  before they make <u>crocodile dundee</u> three.
well... to be honest... i'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm afraid i'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure.
miles. three other suits. that's all i know 'em as -- suits. were you there?
they can't find a sitter...  hello?  excuse me?  yes, uh, hold on.  just a moment.  it's skye davidson.  she needs directions to the house.  you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?
yeah, it's a gift. you gotta do something with it.
i can't. i got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and i haven't slept and--  where to -- ?
jesus, sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  that's flatfoot data. you're not supposed to have access to that.
suspect zero?
you know, i'm pretty expensive. i get five hundred a week.
what?
ed, come on. what's that gonna do? you're gonna bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it's called "get your shit together before it's too late."
so if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  stay in the guest house.  skip the graduation parties.  you'll never see duquette.  okay?  i love you.
don't forget anchovies. 
terrible times, paul. there are bodies everywhere. i cannot stay here.
huh? move back, baby, i can't see anything.
pike killed west, dunbar killed mueller, childs, and nunez.
i think there's a seven-up in there.
we're leaving from my house in three hours. if you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
no.
i think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
i told you not to go into that racket. you could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
and let my cry come unto thee.
no dear. i don't know them, but i've heard about them.
jordan!
write her.
first they told me he had died at birth.  then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
for once i'm glad you're rumor central.  what in the world is going on?
fuck you, dave...
i'm telling you, you got her spooked. she won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
continues firing.  cutting down the advancing germans.
why doesn't that surprise me?
what number did you tear out?
you're pretty famous aren't you?
owens!
christ, will you look at your hair?
don't say another word, valerie.
if you're happy with phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact hospice to arrange for the body --
ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
yes sir!
don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
jeffrey, how are you? how's the family, okay?
your father doesn't like me.
mr. sulu, you're on manual.
what name?
what do you want?
i thought she was dead.
what an asshole!
get out of here before this really goes up.
is this a fair mix?
what'dya get?
i'm here with ed over at taxi. there's been some trouble with tony.
then we have to find a safe port around here.  got any ideas?
you don't believe me.
major!  some day i think you and i are gonna have a serious disagreement.
to isolation.  to an armed camp.  to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
braces?
do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
no, that's what i want to talk to the mayor about.  we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
there are two doors to your house. a front door and a back one. if you answer correctly -- you live.
i don't jog, mr. booker. i run.
i'm afraid he's been stalling.
i don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  my deal with job was subject to a successful boot scan.  obviously it didn't pass muster.  deal's off.
we gotta two battalions and one frenchman.
i bought him his first legal drink. he got so pissed that night....
i'm sorry.
wait! you can't kill me. mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
i don't know. stanzi? stanzi!
ah yes, august gorman. have you looked for work this week, mr. gorman?
how much you playin' for?
notice that nothing happens.  now say 'montana.'
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i'd be greeting you as a national hero.
no -- but it makes the rest easy to take. and she's reading the bible.
don't let this talk of heroes upset you, jack.  sigurd's sword is no great thing.  the volsung killed fafnir.  you killed lindfarne. that's one worm apiece... i'd say you and sigurd were neck-and-neck.
oh no.  no.  we'll get her assistant.  what's-his-name? nebbishman?
the question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
jack, i'm innocent! help me.
<u>what</u>!?
all right, no more picking on dim, brother. that's part of the new way.
fred. the way he looked when you screamed at him.
just like that?  these people ruined your life, bro.
roberto?  how long?
four.
do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  do you know any of the victims...
loves animals? ouch. must love animals, rose.
all right. at a quarter to five.  say, why don't we get married in marseilles?
but you can't *do* that, grampa. this here land is goin' under the tractor. we *all* got to git out.
a drill, what are you up to?
'tis but a scratch.
how'd they --
--  now to recap, i want to stay in arizona, i want my new contract, i like you, you're nice to my wife, i will stay with you, that's what i'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. you listening?
yes. it reminds me of home.
oh no... this is a battle of nerves between john and me.
why wasn't i notified?
needs salt.
blue, then.
... like we're being watched.
he's right.  they must have clobbered some of our cities already.
where is this...thing?
do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? maybe even more?
he sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
a lot that means.
whoever tossed this place wants you.  and i'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
why would you do such a thing?
mr. malcolm x, why do you teach black supremacy? why do you teach hate?
i'd like you to have them.
really, do you think so, really?
and she saw you?
you will take them all, mr. jimmy?
we are so alike, xavier. still, sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
[fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
i don't know.
what you doin'?
thanks.  you're not bad yourself...
where' you goin'?
you know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  how do you know i'm not going to try to rape you?
here's the money, and the phone. please, dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
you want something, old man?
it's a tightrope, spud, a fucking tightrope.
darling!  now tell me--tell me all about yourself. who are you?
that's the truth...
i'll think you'll find everything in working order. molly's just having a little fun.
you're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
no. he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. to cleveland, actually.
certainly not.	you're a mutant.
it's important.
off the scale.
she says it's not.
no?  what's keeping you?
mr. gittes! that's an outrageous accusation.  i don't know what you're talking about.
it's anti-nature.
don't litter my cab!
obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
maybe i should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and i'd never clean it up.
it's six o'clock.  time's runaing out.  decide.
i don't know what to say to him.  i can't.
the deal is whatever mr. bastaldi says it is.
what is your problem?
no, no.
i'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  you watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
like a lowjack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. it pulses at 230 giga-hertz.
come on, guys. it's five o'clock.
well, where did he go?
i tell you once again -- surrender!
you are one scary son-of-a-gun.
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  i was up for going to bixby.  i was getting excited.
it's not even noon --
it was an honest mistake. ridgeway... ridgeroad... ridgeway road.
i don't want to bore you.
the law forbids it.
i could do that.  'course we'd have to go back into town.  there'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  a whole crowd of witnesses.  that wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
no, wait, wait! wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! what is your name?
i don't know. nightmare.
is your friend's name among them?  then he only worked on the one case.  your chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside, i'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
hi. sarah knottingham.
is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
uh-huh.
oh, mr. jason. i really shouldn't be doing this, you know. it's against the rules.  when did you say you wanted them?
but... wait a minute...
what is it?
yeah, i think it is. and i don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- it's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
oh, well, i went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
if you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! is this about gas money?
what'd you write?
get the broom.
how am i gonna sell things if nobody comes by? this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin' much.
alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  what do you want to do?
he's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
why is she bringing that bag?
i don't know.
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information, so on.
the door must not be opened. the barrier must not be crossed. don't go on, doc. no matter how much you feel you have to. there's more power here than you know.
i want you to stay, mariette. you've <u>got</u> to stay. you can't go now!
when i have children, i hope i don't hide behind them.
of course.
like fuck you are.
i wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, jean-luc picard. in my experience, it's unusual for...
well, why should i?
there's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, mrs. mulwray. the coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. just take my word for it. now i want to know how it happened and why. i want to know before escobar gets here because i want to hang onto my license.
christy's a very talented journalist. i see a pulitzer in her future.
excuse me. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, doctor. uh, alvy-alvy, that was the show. they said everything is fine. they found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
the next one blows off your dick.
my name is pronounced fron kon steen.
you -
warm.
so when do i meet up with the husband and give him the look?
mommy...?
bobbi fallon.  bpi.  i'm producing the coke commercials for the playoffs.
butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  i've had it with you.
frightened?  you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  i was petrified.  then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where i was instantly acclaimed oz, the first wizard de luxe!
you know it's not like that --
we can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
it's just some guy i met at swenson's. you don't know him.
bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...
i'11 find him.
on the plane.
you're not a liar.  or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
you will find a market there for this ring. i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
then you have some hot tea?
do you think that's funny?
i'm doing a transfer now.
i don't make the rules.
adam, where are you?
what're you doin', baby?
how are you holding up in this weather?
so this guy walks into a bar and says...
no, not nothing.  what's wrong with the righteous brothers?
harvard? whoa, daddy!
question withdrawn, you may step down.
what?
dead.
hear what?
let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, nora?
well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  when he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
"go into the cloud! ...
well, i was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
oh come on. knock it off.
the, uh, blur there.
arlyn and jane commited suicide. he said they commited suicide.
you've been running round too much. bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
to experience beyond anything ever known. at least that's what i was promised when i bought it. pleasure from heaven or hell. i didn't much care which.
thanks walter.
we got problems.
a gun?  why -- to shoot, of course.
singer!
stop it. he's a nice guy.
mania.
what you got there - beers?
he needs a doctor.
my god.
please, i beg of you.  the american army is there.  i am iraqi.  they will kill me.
wrong. answer.
what, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? photos on the walls?
you a union man?
well, i'll have to take your word for it, mary beth. here's your money.
a long time.
how?
well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  i'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
no. i want to know what the hell is going on.
i should go. i should leave today.
you got a leak in the number nine compartment.
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now.
you mean the snake?
joseph harbin...
who is they? is frank part of some larger group?
grusinskaya... oh -- oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya -- for the success of grusinskaya -- for the triumph of grusinskaya... and what is she now? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- are you listening to me -- do you understand? -- i want you to understand.
i'm not a baby.
you knew when you first saw me.  you knew it would be like this.
i'm lost.  goodbye.
let's go, abdul-shabazz.
or was it toronto?
shelly's already told me all about sex.
even the skylight?
do you play?
stop. we are not having a "duality" conversation. "ooh, he has a secret side.  ooh, she has a dark side." please.  duality is a joke. you get one, do you understand me?  you get one life. one shot. i'm so tired of women saying "i have an inner strength" or "deep down, i'm really ambitious." "one day i'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if i can only remember to return the videos i rented last night." if you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  you need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. there is no gray area. the truth is not somewhere in between. there are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. we are not having a "duality" conversation.
what'd you say?
what are you doing here?
we'll bear off to port and run down wind.
thanks.
no nuns, got it.
i'll just take a minute. deborah ann kaye. you know what i'm talking about. the case is going to trial. our chief witness is a dr. david gruber, you know who he is?
that was really bad, wasn't it?
what was that?
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish. a willing, billing, lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish. be my most tasty little dish! be my most tasty little dish!
how'd you find out?
not a lot of use, are you, fergus?
of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  you know i had something on mother teresa.  but then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  i know how to flush out this simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
oh, yeah. yeah.
that's death knocking, knocking on your door.  crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus?
did you call that radio station again?
oh, mr. denby, i wrote a poem about a bracelet--
thanks for the lift. if the bike's any bother--
oh.
i have no solution for its meaning yet, but i could not just ignore it.
i know what you did.
i think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your dad?
we've got to get cathy.
it's a real privilege, sandman.
which one?
what's all this about sin?
no!
it's a good quote, mary. i'm glad we both know it.
in the middle? you've got the mask, why don't we have him?
you keep strange company, abbe. but if you truly have matters in hand here --
mr. smith has been waiting for you and mrs. trueworthy. can you take care of mr. smith now?
uh-huh.
clear...
i never went in that sphere.
i'm interested in long-term expectations.
... it's hard you know.  you're so far away and i don't know what else to say.
what do you mean?
where is the little lady?
nothing. 
what was that?
maybe?
please do.
you know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. she- she's making progress and i'm not making any progress. her progress is defeating my progress.
you can't believe this bullshit.
gone.
his name is robert paulson!
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, captain james tiberius kirk. i put it to you, captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
one more night and you're finally rid of me.
you liked the guy, though.
what's that?
this luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
luke, don't talk that way. you have a power i--i don't understand and could never have.
well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, i'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  shanna and ashley?
in the meantime harry can slaughter us a hog.
right now?
mine's new.
'cause she will tell you.
what for?  we've got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
hammer, you alright?
i work for harry zimm, alright?
swim where?  out there?  oh, no, forget it, not me!  you go, i'm staying.
that's the wrong way!
what's wrong, available?
hell of an assistant, isn't he?  damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
dr. floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may i ask you a straightforward question?
not really. though, it is strange when you think about it. it didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
but it was a whole lot of killing. why should we miss that?
yes. we're suing.
i don't know. it all gets back to that cynthia thing. i don't like her... eagerness. there's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
...no.
goldmouth? they say he was born out back behind the shithouse. that's what they say.
yeah, but never what you looked like. not really. never really studied your face, like now. i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
why do you smile?
i'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but i sure as hell can't see one.
it's true. i wouldn't lie.
i haven't decided yet.
please.  any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the n.s.f.  i have been in contact with a few other seti people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. i've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
he had no choice.  you're a formidable adversary.
tony marvin.
yeah.
don't get carried away.
what you been doing?
i do.
i fear she's lost.
i hate jello.
initiate launch sequence.
yeah. rogue. picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
there is nothing like a good old country breakfast. where's ma?
my name is josephine.
what report?
you made your decision yet?
something must have gone wrong. i guess i'll try number two.
pardon my glibness trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. the next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. you're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
*you* tell jim taylor.
can i take him with me and have sex with his head?
there were three strawberries.
fifty yards and closing.
well? what are your plans?
where have you been the last few weeks?
every cop has a story and every story has a girl. the girl in my story was fifteen years-old. she wore a pink angora sweater -- i can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. i told the police she wouldn't run away, i told them who to look for, but i was just a kid. i sat in the police station crying and crying. my parents took me home. the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher i'd had. he kept her alive a week before he killed her. the police could have saved her. every time i see a photo of a victim i see her. that's what i want to do. i want to save her.
<u>you</u> did this?  you carved all these little figures and houses and things?
i'm going to sit with kalen.  keep the fire burning if you can.
i've been hired as an independent contractor by the u.s. resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit.  if you have any time over the next few days, i'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? you know, mark ratner.
hello, smith.
phil, i'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. they hate him. he hates them. what kinda intimacy am i gonna create with all this hate in the air. even you and i feel it.
no.
sir, someone mentioned you received the navy cross.  may i ask what you got it for?
then what?
not exactly modern.
wait a minute -
funny, i never thought of you that way.  you were so close too.  we were all pretty stupid about you.
well, i do trust him.  lando's an old friend.  must have been an accident.
...moron.
oh... i'm sorry i have to rush but i've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... tell me exactly how it all turned out.
oh-oh. somebody's just made it.
what on earth?
you talk to carl ?
is there any way out of it?
rose, tell us more about the diamond. what did hockley do with it after that?
specifically, humpback whales.
that is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
dunne, it's jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17c with a bogus ticket. says he knows you. he won't tell me his name.
oh.
i carried that rifle in world war i.  this book is a 16th century policy report for the king of austria.  the diploma is my con- ference of degree in latin from trinity college.  class of 1672.  it goes on.
right. light smoke, low roll. couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, brian?  c'mon, you promised. be honest.  okay... guard!
whoever that is.
where you going at this hour?
steady... steady, boys. keep scanning...  i thought you people were reliable... where the hell is he!
obviously it's some kind of screw up. the shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
oh, and could i get a quart of wild turkey, two fifths of baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
that guy knows you?
he was innocent.
won't forget?
never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. his file says he is an avid jogger.
i'm going out for awhile.
yes, sir.
don't . . . george?
i was set up.
you sound like the media.
today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
fine with me.
sure i do.
yeah, like what?  quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  lottery tickets?  a travel iron?
put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
doesn't count.  you gotta say the words.
you always talk like this?  you're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
i know that you used to work with an architect.
this guy must have had a .44 like yours, jack. now he's got yours.
hey, don't i get an encore?
you see, like you and i...
i was raped.  by sam lombardo.
ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, mister murphy?
what about me?
hey, good morning, barry.
please, they'll kill me...
i do not often think of the past.
drive? i'm not old enough yet.
pain by nerve induction... a human can resist any pain. our test is crisis and observation.
hey. you made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. it's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the atm and get your money out --
it will take years to make that many statues.  but your work would be featured.
i don't know.  if it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  it was still searching for meaning...
lorenzo saint dubois.  but everybody calls me lsd.
we'll call it the flying donut!
i wasn't expecting you.
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
yeah? how's our new witness?
sophy?  are you okay?
we did it one time, only once.  it had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  everything i've got i've earned.
then help me--- for his sake...
oh, he's fine.  he's-he's, i guess he's fine.  i don't know.  he's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
it's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
i'm gonna need a full name, stanley.
let's wait for some slow one.
hear what?
josephine.
i don't know.
right. except... time has a way of --
gordon what i want--and i never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. i want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. it's gonna make us a fortune!
...my... home?
no.
he's all yours.
my name is sidney winch, and -
george . . .
not coming? what happened?
you do have a vivid imagination, mr lombard. i only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. i fail to understand your purpose in this. still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
yes.
the one down your trousers.
does that mean you love me?
should we get a what?
that'll blow the ship up.
will you excuse me?
well, we know you were there. the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
aaron should be hearing this so i have an extra witness.
they don't have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you're the only one in town that can help me.
my harrier.  join us, colonel.
don corleone, i wish you let me know you was coming.  we could have prepared something for you.
come on, kid. i'll buy you a drink.
any word from canada?
victor laszlo?
so what do we do?
joe, from the day i arrived to the day they fired me, i performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. and if they hadn't fired me, that's what i'd be doing today.
so whaddya think.  i mean... i could... uh... get a job.  of some kind.  i mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
no, wait, no wait, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
i'm fine, babe.
what?!  what about him?!
bad dreams again?  do you want something to help you sleep?
two whole drums --
we're fine.  turkey sandwiches.
what the hell did this?
hope so. those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. one fifty! it's not even covered.
... we must try to communicate with them.
oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
still torturing yourself over that enid, huh?
son-of-a-bitch. you're some piece of work, aren't you?
i've lost interest.
yes, sir...  how can i help you?
sure i am. what made you turn up, after all these years?
you were how long on this?
come, sweetheart. let me put it on you. you will teach these jewels. for the first time they will learn how they can look.
put it in the middle of the room!
for bringing you here. come on, tell!
ready lloyd?
they think we're carrying cuban refugees.  skipper, they mean to board us.
i'm needing lunch.
intimately. for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others. i have been swimming in blood my entire life. but i retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but i believe that private lives should not be public property.
importation value?  at twenty-two thousand a ki...
that's okay, hon, i always expect the unexpected.
i would.  but my suit --
i've been disavowed.  they think i killed jim and everyone else.  somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  kittridge assumes i'm a mole they've been tracing and i've been in the employ of an arms dealer, max, for the last two years, to get him our noc list.
games & theory ? that's military intelligence... oh, carl !
what is it, sam?
rowan mayfair.
this is not relaxing.
give it to me!!!
we'll all get out of here together.
i have lived to see two things i never expected.  an englishman afraid to support a friend. and a frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
there.
i'm not playing a game now.
yes. washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by madame lafayette--
i know.
then what do we do?!
that's my job too.
did you have a dream?
my kids don't have enough to eat!
in the field museum once.
oh, god! here yuh go! oh, good, now he'll think-  aaaah! okay.
reed. how close are we to a cure?
sure. cheating, lying. what's a little werewolf a few days a month? we can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
jesus christ!
look here, the mountain man. you're walker, right?
do i have a choice in this?
*you* taught her, i suppose...
about you.
it's too late...she's a woman grown now...
i don't like to come here, roy. every time i do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
please.
dave, can i just ask you this directly?  did you ever work for the cia?
you are a hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  he gambles a great deal, and wins.  do you know the cards well?
what are you talking about, erik?
yes. from wendel. to celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. i forgot to tell you.
no -- don't cry --
yeah, thanks a lot.
from where??!!
well. . . yeah.
what happened afta that?
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
you wanted a story.  you got it.  turn on the tv now.  and then get your ass down here ...  ...
it's really fifties. you sort of clash with the world.
look--committees--small groups of senators--have to sift a bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole senate. you can't take a bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. where would you get?
please tell only who you must, i don't want to be responsible for a panic. and get to a boat quickly. don't wait. you remember what i told you about the boats?
what is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
how much time's left of your sentence?
it's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
whoa... she just farted.
we can't stop him. not now. handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. please andy...
thank you, fred. thank you. minister turns and signals. door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a hi-fi on a trolley.
i'm allison, you're 'honey'.
thirty-two minutes left...  but chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
bob.
i guess you know why you're here
...he gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
our habitat, i mean.  this place can't handle another attack.
you done?
why the bad temper?
i'll get a manual.  and study it.
why? 'cause i... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? that's not following!
that's not what you said. you said if you didn't have a winning record --
it looks fine. how much will it be, with my car...?
transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  override the airlock sensors and hurry!  we're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
do you understand why i came here?
i'm going first.  taking the fire. if we go out together we're all dead!
you're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  i thought you stopped doing that long ago.
stay out of it.
jerry, i want you to be soft. you are soft -- inside -— where it matters. i wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick doug.
did you wish to?
no! do they show you having sex?
oh, honey... what happened?
do i know you?
you got a point there.
well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of mrs. rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. get me?
ergo?
or you could surrender.
uh... the admitting nurse...
are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
he doesn't want to sleep here.  neither do i.  it's not my house anymore.
it's just not your day, is it rosemary?
of course - iím sorry to hear you say that claire.
b.f.d. what do you plan to do? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy.
it had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
see? did you see that?
we must take action on this immediately.
well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
not be safe?  what on earth are you talking about?
fooling around?
park avenue and east 2nd. take centre to canal, up the bowery, cooper and third, left on 41st, come around on park.
somewhere near the capital?
murder witness.
why, i ain't hardly touchin' you!
papers.  just papers.  you know, my papers.  business papers.
don't tell me: heavy duty.
my god...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
this puts me in a peculiar hole.
what?
he did something with the ground.
us??  we'll never catch them.  any- way, we're all done, teemo.  let's go home.
yeah. there's a girl in it now.
what?
we don't have a maid any more.
but everything the white man taught you, you learned. he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. and you believed him. he taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed god with white skin -- and you believed him. he told you black was a curse, you believed him. did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
we are both from prague.
i was, but no... yes... i was before, but now i'm not. it's irrelevant, really. the idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. but i'll tell you something, until about five months ago, i really enjoyed my work.
how come i can't remember?
who the hell are you?
been sending her meals in regularly?
oh my god. what happened?
that you... you don't even know the guy.
who.
yeah. how'd you know?
i'm going to lynn bracken's.  i'll meet you at the dining car.
uh--getting back to this, senator--
you're a princess...
i begin to believe in it myself since i've met you. i still don't know what to make of it. it confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, ninotchka.
that is enough!  you are a good servant, d'artagnan, but you forget your place!
well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
i did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours! i can make this work.
pops!
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
there are still things i have to do.
he's called a couple times.
why - er - mrs. teasdale - this is an outrage!  this man is impossible... my course is clear...  this means war...  you runt!
he's blind, for chri...
i don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, i'm starting to think rorschach may have been right.  is laurie okay?
wolfi.
see?  you could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
hey.
life is good.
this is all a mistake! don't you understand?!
the "chronicle" is a good newspaper.
linda.
you're sure?
could i ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  i should like to have them.  i should be honored.
on the house. you did me a favor. check the corridor.
i did.
yeah, but it's real close.
sir--
doolittle, hello?
god, that smoke's poisonous!
he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
i got him on loan from disney.
what-what? where you been the last four five years? outer space?
wonderful woman.  we were very--
well, are you or are you not, charlie?
it makes me sad.
geronimo is down.
why?
c'mon, have a drink.  you look like you need one bad as me.
i remember that dress.
we're going! we started la resistance to save terrance and phillip! we're going!
harry, we spoke with martin.
i have great interest for america, his peoples and his custom.
why too late?
wow, that really is great. in a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
yes.
what are you going to do?
look, i can do it!
sorry.
no. i'm the exact opposite --
you were right.  it's nothin' like i thought.  i almost wish...
anything else you --
who?
i haven't been back for ten years. is your family still there?
now that's sharp. that's real sharp. miss ella mae set you up, didn't she? you like it?
appreciate that, sidney. but our leading man can't remember his lines. and his understudy can't carry the play.
they nail him for it bad ?
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them...
chris!
but if you wanna talk about bad luck...
i'll tell you.
i still think he's responsible for the smear.
yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
what's the matter?
god, how i have looked forward to this, honey.
that's right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
what happened?
now what?
i should be in by two.
i want my fucking money --
colwyn.
what if it doesn't come back?
something's wrong here.
he did not do these things.  if you knew him, you would realize...
where's the girl? miss stone.
are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
we still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
i mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  he's a sales rep for chrissakes. whenever i can't get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day. six seconds and i'm out.  but he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
he wanted to kill me!
but i would like to see you again.
how long has my father been like this?
there you are.  out you come.
suit yourself, champ.
my sister megan, she's a big fat cow. was then, even more so now. i'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
stop this nonsense! if you're in some sort of trouble i want to know about it.
i. don't. dance.
oh dear.
we don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. why would the germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? i mean it <u>was</u> world war two, not a school play.
come on, esperanza -- how about it? we got to.
what's going to happen to stensland?  he'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>he's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
here's the patrol.
we started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
jeanne...!  are you alright?
let's kick his ass.
lenny, have you lost it completely?
leave off..
...there were about nine or ten people, cubans, friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. place was a mess.  dave's mind was a mess,  y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
please take us to the beach where we landed.
we thought it was just.
in your backyard? how do you protect them?
where are the tapes?
hey, tim, you know what? you win.
no. i ain't see anything like that.
i was kidding.
you made it.
you first!
i'll drive.
you're off to a late start.
why did you continue to see him?
batman.  the thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
you can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! i'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
you are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  he is a lucky man.
you know, tommi wants me to become the man i used to be.
mr. pope! mr. phillips! welcome, george bryan! james armitage!  sam! my pretty one! are you ready to fall in love again?
oh.  well, where do we start?
no, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. crows, i think. i don't know, daddy. is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
i heard from stella you were trying to find jake. what happened to emmett?
this is who you were. exactly who you are is up to you.
they won't be left back. they'll stay in their grade.
my mind plays tricks on me. is it okay if i take a bath now?
dr. hirsch?  i'd rather not be by myself.
look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. we'll have dinner -- talk it over.
good mornin', nathan.
like to who?
get the three thousand. play minnesota fats again.
uncharted. we'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
no.  i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. you may see the entire annhiliation of the world. if not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. we can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. we'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
well taken, concorde!
how do i discuss operations over an open line?
if you want me to.
why in god's name would anyone want to work for them?
i'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
what do you want from me?
thirty-bucks?  that's it?
we know you're not stupid, ms. tramell.
what the hell is happening, worf?
what do you mean?
nice wallets.
this looks to me like a good sign. don't you think so? as far as i'm concerned, anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. why... as a matter of fact, i remember when i was in china, many years ago, i happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an english woman, the wife of ambassador shafford, a good friend of mine. there, too, we found a bible... and i said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. why, it was logical, i said, that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore...  no? you don't believe it? well, as a matter of fact, i was right... the woman was found two days later. it was a case of amnesia.
did you?
you're talking like a mad man.
there's no connection between the families.
that's all right.  we let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
that's not the issue here, those people are.  he can't do it alone.
well... you see, when i broke it off with phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
can i come in?
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
"i'm lowell bergman, i'm from '60 minutes.'" you know, you take the "60 minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. maybe wigand's right. maybe i'm hooked. what am i hooked on? the rush? "60 minutes"? what the hell for? infotainment. it's so fucking useless, all of it.
thanks for the lift.
how can i know such a thing?
go ahead, senor.  i have my friend to keep me company.
god bless you.
seventy-five.
how does he know so much about me?
are you peeking?
oh god, please!  this can't be happening!  i can't be plastic!  a plastic man?!
you better quit that.
let me ask you a related question. we've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  what is your policy for treating addiction?
sam's piano.
what, sweetheart?
... the bodies out the door.
mrs. d! i was hoping you'd show up.
hey, i love you.  so do a lot of the guys.  so hang in there, man.  hang in there.
there ya go. complete with air canisters...little motors.
what are you talking about?
so?
shouldn't be, dil
don't talk to them anymore.  sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to algeria - i'll write you from there.
what's with the wigs?
i really don't think . . .
you got my cell. leave a message.
i can't move to tidy.
nice night out...
there is, but it's not that interesting.
are you going to get remarried?
why?
oh, yeah.  no, no, no.  they wouldn't --
nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
what's going on? when do we get paid off...?
what are you fighting for in here? the good of rome?  i can end this madness now!  take the job for the sake of the gods, live!
how many bedrooms will your house have?
it's okay, craig. it all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
that fish smelled strong.
relax!
what do we have here, margaret?
great...great...listen, i'm very interested in you guys because i'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
what did you get?
a little too tight, eh?  ...they were my son’s. only thirteen and already six feet tall. a real lanky boy...  i... there’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
ha!
cheer up, nigel. it's not the end of the world.
where have they gone?
i'm going through a period of my life where i just can't be around people.  i didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
found on carl's boat, too.  starboard side, second cleat from the stern. but it doesn't match carl's lines. it matches miyamoto's.  perfect.
there ya go.
it's not often an emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
yes.
yeah.  i think so.
grazie, mio caro, wolfgang!
if the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
really?  it makes me sick.
leave it where it is.
they don't break in the summer! do you know what building is right over this spot?  harriman tower. their sub-basement was flooded! he didn't die in a pool.  call the coroner in rhode island!  ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
one hour.
...in.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
to peace on earth.
maybe...
i'll tell bill you dropped by. i'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
just meet with the boy once a week.
marseilles.
the ropes are coming loose.
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
she was cute.
you wanna come?
i don't know what you're asking?
what's your name?  don't you walk away from me. this is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
well, i'm next. you won't hear anything like that, mr. galbraith.  i'm not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose.
i don't know. he went to school here, then he was in new york for awhile, then philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
and what is he in prison for?
couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
whatever i say, you'll take him away, won't you?
women. you know, i can't help feeling rather sorry for scobie.  wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
prison communication systems.  an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado. yes sir.
didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
and i'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
ten dollars! hell, i can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
welsh again.
eddie, i want to thank you.  these last few days have been a good time.
what have you got there?
i think tex did it.
shit! you just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. i knew this was a scam. i shouldn'ta come.
you've been through quite an ordeal, mrs. haydn. why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? we'll fly you home.
so you come out with her robinson's/may bag, go meet sheronda. simone peeks out, waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. she leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
gregor, is that you?
i'm sorry, but do i know you --
let me show you something. the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
you showed up warner in class? you're supposed to be showing up sarah.
he had a gun.  i have it now.
yah, well, they exist all right.
what are you doing?
i'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. so far i haven't been able to find him.
thanks....
abbe de coulmier!
yeah.
gabriel?  are you asleep?
two.  sherry?... nice joint. you look very pretty.
you're a girl.
son of a bitch.
yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  god, listen to this!  "it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
you think he don't know? i give him his cut of seventeen hundred, i think he knows i can't make that lap dancing.
mirtha, what's going on?  everything okay with kristina?
sure. why not.
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna's list of clients?
i don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. get the fuck out of here.
i'll be there in 5 minutes.
you're right.  thanks for the drink.
first time?
did you call the state police?
phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  you'd do well to mind your own business.
really, captain, it was a lovely toast.
why not?
thelma.
you have to stop doing that!
do you have any brothers or sisters?
daddy, where's my money?
you don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and i wrestled. but when i get with you, and i say to myself, "my god--here i am with the wife of harold ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
satch is busting me for sissy clark's murder.  john...
i thought you knew... she was put on over a week ago-
don't ever trust them.  they never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  vietnamese are like russians.  both are dogs.
she wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
no comment.
no, i'm not. why do you think she does all this? it's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. when you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. to tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... but you had something you wanted to ask me?
last night.
would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
i'm coming with you.
what are you thinking about?
why not?
good luck?
no.  tell them i'll do it.  but i want more posters all over rome.
what's wrong with how i carry myself.
what? really?
oh, i forgot to tell you. while you were unconscious, i injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. it's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now i've attached it to your left ventricle.  a little trick i picked up from the borg.
well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! you're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- i never had much, but what i did have -- i lost.
when did you start working for the goddam d.a.?
i got good news, and i got bad news. the good news is you got your shot at the title. the bad news is...
this was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. everyone in town knew him.
the <u>doors</u>, mr. scott!
we certainly did.
you miss him, don't you?
yes.
i didn't want it to end this way.  i wanted hauser back.  but nooo.  you had to be quaid.
yeah. i got out.
where the hell could they have gone!
you don't owe me that.
ever done this before?
ml stands for ml.  that's it.
yeah, i know. i mean, i'm not saying i know people think you're a bitch, i'm saying i know what you mean. and i don't even know that people think you're a bitch. do they?
so you weren't interested in music at all?
hell no, baby... i wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
okay.  so he was tall?
who did this?
what?
you gonna carry that around all night?
what should you have known?
hello.
that's right, it's nuwanda.
huh?
do you promise?  i wouldn't want to die here.  i wouldn't want to die in the desert. i've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  very english.  and i know exactly where i want to be buried.  in our garden.  where i grew up. with a view of the sea.  so promise me you'll come back for you.
i used to live here.
what's a concubine?
hi.
okay, wade.  translators?
the people at this school are so incredibly foul.
true.
don't listen to him, little sister. when you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
feed? well, of course she feeds me. she stuffs me like a goose all day long. she's the best cook in the world. i mean, since mama. just wait, you'll see.
he can pilot?
so uh -- how come i haven't seen you around here before?
sidney winch, meet -
well, he knows a little about me.
tucker, you know where the money is-- i want it.
we can, can't we? trust you?
whacking is not of much use on a farm.
- but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places..
i ain't going anywhere. i'm right here. i'm not gonna leave ya.
pretty slick, eh?
no dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  it's just his mind poured out on paper.  i don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
i see her for business.
if you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  if you get an oscar, i get the left foot.
... what do you mean?  i'm in the ship.
who are you?
now and then.  mostly just for the fun of it.
i said i was too young to drive.  i didn't say i was stupid.
don't call me "honey," mack.
what are you talking about?
for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
look, i didn't set the price. i'm just working here. if you want it, take it. if you don't, turn right around and beat it.
not even then. the police are the proper people to conduct this affair. now if you've got any suspicions i'll drive you to the nearest police station.
who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  either way, natalie's still gonna find out.
why do you want to do that for?
you're a fool, babe.
so what do we do for money when we get to new orleans?
it must be the most marvelous supper. we may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
i know.  i said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
hello, william. i understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. i would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
thea, what is this? what are you trying to tell me? "he stole your mother" —-
yeah.  you said... i thought you were never getting out?
we run smack into a police patrol. you know what i mean? we broke it in half!
i'm gonna go ask him.
i was not.
you think it's ok where i left it, right there?
you're a shrink, doc. aren't i supposed to be able to tell you everything?
well. well. well. look who made bail!
heart to heart? woman to woman? including a casual reference to the part of "cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
but she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
i have no evidence of your taking anything. you didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; i was glad to see that. you've been helping us out, you gave us melanie and louis. melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
why not?
four five nights ago.  that's how i know the romance is off.  also steve's in a very bad mood.
please, oh, please, i haven't done anything to hurt you.
frank.  we know.  we know it's shepard.
go on.
i'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
girls?  you call those skanks girls?!
excuse me. i was just going up to my room.
don't you <u>touch</u> that...i want them gone.
i don't think you locked your door.
and you, m'sieu giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
rent.  you're late.
you understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
how you holding up, wade?
hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
it's okay. it's okay.
you noticed..
i hope this place is cool. we could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
come on. we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
...why?
i don't think so. this guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
get in the skiff, pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
since i made lieutenant.
you got some kind of list?
i'll be there in three hours.
your friends use the pool. your friends messed it up.
have a nice time over there?
not even a radio?
no.
i know you did, frank, but i assure you there was an impending failure.
...and abby. maybe. but as far as i'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
i don't know. i just keep going over and over the numbers.
whoa.  name's hawkins, eddie hawkins. my nickname's hudson hawk, but don't call me hudson, not even as a joke. the nuns at st. agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what i am today. not a compliment...
i got it.
my dreams of marion are gone. i killed them myself. if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death, i'd welcome it.
think we can make it?
who are you?
who was that?
i didn't understand the spot i was putting roderick in.
if i tell you where llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
what?
i thought you blew all your money.
finished what?
i'm assuming you read my deposition.
what, um...  what do we do?
so what else is on this list?
what did he say exactly? i mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
how much time do they get to spend with their dad?
why?
what is it keaton?
my advice?  hop on over to reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
because... there was no way to win.
and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, ellen brody here will be happy to answer them.
parachute.
she was smiling at how money i am, baby.
ten reasons. maybe fifteen. and also there's something in it for me.
shall i tell them again?
what the hell is that?
i know, but think about it -- at the parties that night.  chicks are gonna want to do it.
i'm very sorry i...
you said she was shallow. yeah, and a nouveau riche.
so what?
what are you doing?
i always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
they don't?  then why do they still write me fan letters every day. why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  because they want to see me, me, me!  norma desmond.
how much do you weigh?
ah, david.  finally.  and this must be our professor from across the sea.
nevertheless, mrs lampert -- you've got it.
it's, uh, parked just off of highway thirty-five.
you look better than veronica lake.  now, <u>pierce patchett</u>.
it's not my voice ... but i know her.
hell yeah. i love. i love sex.
you what?
no. can't pretend that much.
i believe that... ms. lewton's next.
tony? this is keith fisher. you're doing my wedding and i'm calling about the chair situation. yeah, i'll hold.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. c'mon.
that's right.
i got three.
i never do field work and even if i did, <u>maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
don't take no tone of voice with me, homes.
what?
don't, paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
well, i just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so i can get the ball rolling.
would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
i can do it myself.
hey butt-head, i'm starting to feel weird. i think i'm freaking out.
one question, doctor, please!  you can't do this! i'm the press, i have rights!!
boys and girls, moms and dads.  children of all ages, i'd like you to meet... jimmy bones.
you got any more orders, captain?
what you doing around here then?
one question.
hi, guys.  burt loaned me his camera.
is there an ashtray in here?
help yourself.  since when do you smoke?
she's not alone...she's...boyd...oh god...he's gone nuts...he killed lois and micheal...it's all...
some or it.
no further questions.
the box. i need the box.
but you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  well, it's not my first script.
as i recall, you've robbed it before.
i can't do it, rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and i ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
listen to this, i love this part --
oh, no, no, no...  buzz, look!  an alien!
we gonna jump or jerk off?
tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  rest easy, jack.
who is he? who is she? who are you? who am i?  who are you?
yes... sometimes you have to give them candy.
what's a jizz-mopper?
kit...
i would say your future's looking dim, boss.
and how many soldiers do you have?
i asked you how you like your coffee...? we have black and bitter.  as the soul of man.  or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
i finally got through to sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the grand jury about haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the grand jury asked him the goddamn question.
a russian! i love russians! comrade... i have been fascinated by your five- year plan for the past fifteen years!
i've got the hang of the driving.  found this place all right.
it's heavy.
yeah, for some reason, i'm sure...
let's get him over to the bed.
i swear to god. it's her. she told jody she was kenny's 'aunt lisa'. i'm getting this sickly feeling...
i am. i'm always there, but i only shine at night.
i'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
but he's never there.
i don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
his word? are you telling me haven promised you something?
'"... or i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house down!" and inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
for frontera? hell, i can't remember dates no more. i do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. he almost took some poor fella's head off at the legion in arroyo grande, and figured it was time to move on.
guys, let's not panic.  isabella's safe.
that's right. but you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. and i'd like to have it!
your not gonna marry him are you?
who?
rose... please...
imagine my surprise when i got your call, max.
you do?
golly, ma --  consarn that music! shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
-- hang on --
he's got you believing in zero now too.
because it's about <u>purity</u>...
when we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  now she's just hostile.
what about the draft?
a statement? good.
good.
we still talk, though.
then you go into the foyer.
you look so sad.  is it something i have done?
i don't know— i don't know! i tell you i ain't made up my mind yet. that's what i wanted to talk to you about.
what are you doing?
do you have everything?
clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
this is not about martyrdom.
go. hurry up. let's go.
...yes.
you were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
i did.  is that door locked?
we used to take baths together.
you’re right. i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie. and after all that? the only one who ended up falling for it was me.
it's y. o. h.
what...amulet?
okay, doc. what's the damage? how much time have i got?
there's no way to practice this. and no time. besides, i've planned it all. there aren't any surprises.
alexander pope?
mary clarence!
sorry, my ass.
so does grandma. so does shaquille o'neal. you told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
they're crucifying you out there.
she'll be out in a moment.
she's going to help you understand what makes sid 6.7 tick.
is that normal?
this is so embarrassing! you guys had to carry me out.
how long you and me known each other?
do you mean church of england?
it all started with our mission in istanbul.
how i said i shot five men... it wasn't true.  that mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... i busted his leg with a shovel... i didn't shoot him or nothin'.
open the damn safe!
where?
the pentagon?
can we turn the light on?
we're down to seven minutes.
hello! you're like, a lawyer.
hey, you know henry kissinger -- he's down from harvard.  on my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
what about her?
i thought he was lying.
maybe we should give him some water.
what's this? december 8th, 1958?
i could be convinced, if ... i knew who poisoned me in the maze. that kiss ...
please sit down.  i told your wife. i'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  i've got a case coming in two days in the  superior court and my office is a mess of papers.
i don't look my age, joe.
you really think i'm crazy, don't you?
-- oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
my father didn't want it incinerated.
when i'm sober. they get a little mixed up when i'm drunk. most of the time they're mixed up.
oh no, it's the doctor.
good night?
can you do anything for him?
it's all the stuff i get to do. oh my god, oh my god... okay, okay... we get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- eeeh! okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- no way. oh... my... god!
oh yeah?
yours not to reason why, miss teschmacher. relax! enjoy it!  just look at that smog!
could we have a word?
okay, so that's it.
&lt;&lt;no, no, no. i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. i am going to be killed. i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
you couldn't believe it?  vince the prince?
i had a dream about this place.
a big, rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
what did you hear?
and my compliments to you...
there's no more time for games. they made you. there's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. tell me if it's true.
i've continued working on the case!
these girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  the oldest is twelve.  the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
you want the rest of those numbers, mr. dickson?
i know my time's up, but i've got to get this out while i've got hold of it --
everyone must leave the hotel now.
nothing?
is it japanese?
you're clean.
there's something out there!
well, it's kind of skanky. isn't that what you girls call it? skanky? skeevy?
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  what the fuck is going on? i'm not talking. this is not me!
you say you've come here on your own account?  no one knows you are here?
what about an untrained pup, white...
i was good to you! you re nothing but no-talent garbage! you're a two-bit tramp!
i didn't mean to bite him, i really didn't.
where are they?
good. what do you want?
brains aren't everything.
he didn't say nothin'. just drive.
you gonna drive out there?
you ain't coming to work?
you got me pretty fucking curious.
you ever been in a hostage situation?
no -- we're going to attack the termites!
no, george, we've already done that with lonnie. the blind one last year, remember?
guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
hi.
tough, tough!
i never met a man i couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
but, sir...i...i...
alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
we're going back to nature, you and i. i'm going to retrain you. i'm going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it.
i'm only going to have you for two more years. if you decide not to go on to college--
int. tunnel - day.
i'd know him anywhere.
yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in bloomfield hills.  now, i don't give a shit what they do.
didn't we put up a strong resistance?
right, i'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
penelope!
you know i'm not.
i was in a coma, pollux. i still feel like shit.
have many famous actors and actresses lived here? i was meaning to ask you that.
b-but... we saw... your neck...
hit me!
...something like that. yeah.
look -- i was thinking about that time after the party --
where were you?
as long as we've got that straight.
-- it hasn't been two years --
mrs. kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
if we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
what do you mean?  i'm just doing what we've always done.
that's too bad.  you would have been the first one in the family.
whatcha looking at, john??
jesus...
where is everyone?
twenty-four.
better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
i didn't say that.  i never said--
not very good!
seymour scagnetti.
i want to know what in hell you're doing.
bullshit.  they ain't been in the office yet.  give 'em some stiff. we have a deal or not?  eh?  two sits.  the des plaines.  both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, i don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  alright?  the two sits in des plaines.

all right! shut up a second and i'll tell you! jesus! i didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
that's it.
added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.
thank you. the truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
what's he looking for?
ah ha!...
you're crazy.
i like that.
you're kidding.
did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
that means they didn't abandon ship.
isn't it about time you became something else?
ten thousand sounds high.
but we can still do it, honey.
yep.
we'll only be a second, okay?
you paid for my flowers?  they're beautiful.  max, you gonna introduce us?
i'm sorry. after careful consideration, i regretfully have to decline.
because life is good.
i said, i ain't got you...
come on, junior. everyone's waiting for you, son. the beam of light catches junior's face. he is crouched inside the machine at lane six. jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
and what would he do come winter?
i know the feeling. it won't last.  he's a long way ahead of where i was at his age.
not again.
because, because, you know, it's a crime.
shortstop.  'course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
what?
i've got him if you want him.
no, it doesn't.
come on, it's been a long, shitty day. how about a break?  i'll call a tow truck myself, i swear.  i won't budge from this spot.
the dominicans. go pick on them.
you're not a super-hero. you're not even a hero. you're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. you killed someone very special to me..
there's no way of knowing.
someone goes to walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, spic and span, the works.
thanks.
i'm in kinship. listen, sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
this week.
wow!  does this pole still work?
i don't know.
what's the match gag?
with two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as i can. then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
he wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
you heard?
we're looking for the funniest costume! and the scariest! and the most imaginative! and the best costume of all!
oh please, who do you think you're kidding? and where did she spy on the russians from, here in pennsylvania??
get me marylin rexroth doyle.
it looks like you. thanks.
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce. do you believe that, doll?
what if your parents come home?
nathanael, i'm sending you to virginia to head the southern army, to harass cornwallis.  marquis, you must go with him.
okay, okay...
their equipment is primitive but effective. i recommend we land at coordinate 8563.
that's a cow, harry.
... i'm...  ... i'm very grateful that you're here, chauncey...  ... with us ...
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
so how are you doing, dad?
if he finds out it's me, i'm a dead man.
someone?
the death star will be completed on schedule.
there must be a phone around here somewhere.
stephanie, holy shit. chick had it all going on.
yes, mom --
i wish i knew.  it's for my boss.  he's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  would that be okay?
you're looking pretty chipper this morning.
baby, i was gonna give it to you.
andy.
what's it to you?!
i see. and what's strasser doing here? he certainly didn't come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
this is comrade kopalski.
i wouldn't worry.  so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you, the skipper, dave, kent, sir ian and my father -
if i die, then they'll be free. it's getting late, isn't it? i can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. it's warm then it gets cold. jeffrey. i feel it getting cold.
you don't understand! it's her father...
what did you say?
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks. and at last he gave in and said, 'all right, come with me tomorrow,' and so i came and they bombed the station.
will she pick me up after school?
...babe the blue ox?
    elvis is on ice again.
she's here.
do it, goddammit!
ma says breakfast's ready, mr. webster!
what kids?...
raoul is cool.  that's all you need to know.
leadership....
what are we going to do?
why isn't ruiz coming?
you did okay, back there.  i was fairly impressed.
bullshit.
yeah, he can go ...
he does this every year?
how about a "man in jeopardy" story?
lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. you saved my life. i never could have made it alone.
it's ok; i'm sorry i called you a failure.
what year?
praise jesus!
i imagine it would, yes.  so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties.
why?
clarence, i gotta hand it to ya. you were cooler than cool.
wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
let's have a rundown on the damage, lothar?
he's got money.  in a floor safe in the living room.  i've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  more like brags.  he loves his money.  wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  what do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? it pisses me off!
they look like a couple of kids chief.
you're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. the monkey on your back is the latest trend. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
why?
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! they took the idols and smashed them.  the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos. and who have they got now?  some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
hmm! so am i. if you'll excuse me i have some important unfinished business. i'll see you all later.
what is that?
did you do this?
he is at that.  no so much a fault of his own.  poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
i've been trying you for five days. don't they give you messages?
it better be fifteen minutes, because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? and come back three times?
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday.  i thought i'd make my potato salad.  remind me--
shut it up!  shut the little bastard up!
they're letting me have this vacation. which is why the get-up. which is why you haven't heard from me.
i said how's your baby...?
sir, i ran the 220 in high school.
i saw him in vegas once.
meaning me?
i have ideas.
...well, it suits you...
i'm coming.
that's what i...
go away. i am not talking to you.
you don't have to do that.
oh my god! we're dead!
i loved you, madeleine.
well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
are you okay?
brian told you that?
right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
what do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
another satisfied client?
what run him off? tell me that!
okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
can you walk ?
ok. it's a strange world, sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i don't know what he does but i think he's on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.
i can't get over you two. she was asking about you earlier, rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
oh, no.  no.  i'm just finishing up here, and i've got to get home.
i can live with those reflections.
exactly what are you looking for, apollo?
'the cuer-vo gold, the fi-ine columbian.'  you look nice tonight.
my place, can't you see?
i... i can't answer that precisely.
you want the title shot or not?
actually, it's mary brooks now.
kubelik -- with two k's.
m.j., i'm going to have to borrow ruben.  the alien-smuggling thing in chinatown is going down tomorrow night and jack's kid got hit by a car.  i gotta give ruben to nikko.
this is the lapd. if anyone is back here i want you to come out and i want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
i thought about calling, but i want to wait until i know when i'll be out.
what time is it?
now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. our situation has changed considerably. before i had only a claim to the jewels. now i have the jewels.
well?
well, who can blame them, sir?
let it ride for a while.
first thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on greased lightning.
do you want to fuck now?
don't turn around.  keep your eyes on the book.
consideration?
i'm a colonel.
you have a butler working that floor?
son?
masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. but his patience won't hold out much longer.
my secretary saw you with that boy.
you got it.
answer the question. you knew sidney's mom?
i told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. for you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
let the child stay.
oh, dana, it's you ...
it's a pleasure to finally meet you, roman.
you going to work all day?
yeah, i'm fine.  just really hot upstairs.
mom.  i think we've got to have a long talk about something?
yeah... me you, too... i was at your house...
how you doing?
how's miss jacqueline?
listen to me.  he's all about playing games.
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
i want you to go back to new hampshire...think things over.
the world thinks andy kaufman sucks. so i was just giving 'em what they want...
when you going to let me work with you?  why you always fucking with me?
where are you?
what?  this is not possible.
what's this?
excellent work, puff. extra desert tonight.
i want to see him tomorrow, clyde.
i spent all evening on the mainframe. lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. no record of anyone named mofet. but "split city" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. i tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  it's a mini-storage facility outside baltimore, where lecter had his practice.
and you're worried about him.
how are you going to tell me what i have time for?  i mean, whatever i did...we can fix this.
promise.
and your new apartment?
how... how was miss caswell?
of course we're ready. we've taken all the classes. the nursery. the books --
look, i'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. besides, i'm impulsive. it runs in the family. we're all crazy. mind if i smoke?  anyway, today was the 'bid day.' but as i was walking down the aisle, i realized this is total insanity. what am i going to do in texas the rest of my life? i can't marry jerry jeff. i mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. so, halfway down the aisle, i turned and split. you think i'm nuts, right?
what the fuck you telling me, wade? i never seen the guy get shot, i told you that.
you were the one who insisted on it.  reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four.
how hot are they?
welcome to rand memorial hospital, mr. gardiner.
where?
precisely.  but they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that i've provided.  that shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
wow, a lot of people showed up.
you dumb ass, it's babe brother.
that could be told.
just say the word, sir, and i'll do anything.
bye bye blackbird.
carson dyle didn't have a brother.
that's exactly what we wanted to hear.
no, the stones are mine!
sure
are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
i figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
i don't hate you, jimmy.  but i have a couple questions that i wanna ask....
mon dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
nah, man...
hank!
sir ergo? ... my honorable lord ergo? ...
not everybody's supposed to have a family.
you know, you never told me why you left the army.
i'm curious about bourne. your interpretation of his condition. you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
we've driven a long way. where is this place?
guess they're up.
are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
they will come after me.  but i can collect some stool samples, for dna with that, nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
metaxonycha godmani.
i'm afraid i spoke out of turn last night.
i might get a shot.
unpredictability....
we are far from the hollow.  loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
i know they made me.  even got the label on my neck to prove it.
i don't know.
but we do have a choice.  to make it better.  instead of worse.
he is. take my word for it.
right away... instantly!
so, who is in the building?
i turned him down flat.
what does that mean?
 
the hearing's tomorrow. if she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
change what?
jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
in the sub.  resetting the timer. why?
the look on their faces when one walks into the room.  still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
did he tell you that?
yes.
so...if the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? all right, mother, old building and loan pal, i think i'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
tell me... what else did you have?
they're all in it.
buffy, what are you doing here?
i don't know, clarence, "doctor zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
what does that mean?
what?
but i never saw that note!  i must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
but that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
loser.
you're out of your fucking mind!!
let's get out of here. we got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where i do not know, but i know it's gonna be long.
don't take my word for it, quaid. someone you trust wants to talk to you.
for pete's sake, norville!
no.
i'll take my chances.
having a good time, vivian?
...yeah...good...
aren't they gauche...?   those steel things are so - common.
if it's you, what are you doing here?
really.  how wonderful for you.
you know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
you don't need to be here.
did you see jack?
yes, she told me. do you have children, mr. creasy?
what's the matter? anything wrong?
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the grail, i'm afraid... but the knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  this tablet is one of those "markers." it proves the knight's story is true. but as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  now, the second "marker" is entombed with the knight's dead brother. our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice, italy.  as you can now see, doctor jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. we're only one step away.
you've got a comeback for everything, don't you, danny? you use 'em like some sort of shield.
i'm very good at research.  i'll help you.
just go check the temperature.
look, father, ah... just because i don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
what if he's busy tonight?
you know what, ace? i don't give a shit! i'm gettin' out of here.  i am.
i was already prepared to commit one murder. what makes you think i won't commit two?
what do you mean?
they've never done a robbery?
damn right, i have. you think i like living on fucking yucca? we do a good job on this, we're in.
the whale's mouth?
maureen.
i got a pretty good guess.
hildy!
that ain't up to me to hook you up. naw what i mean? she her own, you know?
no, you're frightened, you're pretending. well -- klute knows about me then. does everybody know, can you tell me?
fatal fascination of james brett wins out.
he told you.
the capitol dome! lighted up!
i didn't mean just the theater.
god defeated the english, not me.
it's not like he's a young man. he's had time to live.
hey rob.
she getting good care over there?
how do you feel?
get down!  the ritual chant! quick!  protect yourself!
continued
what? i think i'm saying it. something's going on. he's either converted to christianity -- or to something else.
yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
i don't want to read.
how's it going for you two?
are they grown-ups?
stop it!
can you?  you damn well better be. jesus, if i hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if i'd been totally honest, i wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless i was cleaning it. but that's no reason for you not to be. honest, i mean.  not cleaning the pool.
how many men does cornwallis have under his command?
oh, you did it yourself!
speak english!
make a list.
memo e-7 on top will cover the details.  an abandoned vietnamese army base in the north-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  as you can see the intelligence is soft.  these landsat photos show huts... barracks.  it could be anything.
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance!
<i>we gotta bring him in.</i>
if you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over both our lives if we let him.
then, i suppose the time has come say it's been nice dwight lionel. it's been everything. oh, dwight, i'm frightened.
four months?
in your pocket, please...
do you care ?
jesus, reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
that was quick.
they found the drop car up on mulholland.  i want you two to go work it.
part of the original structure. when it was still an asylum. guy who ran the place -- dr. vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." from some german cathedral a million years ago: "driving the demons from the mind."
hi dad.
cash.
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
max offered to stake me.
was this all about the oil?
you'd say anything to keep me away from her.  to keep her for yourself.
i can't take this, sailor. she's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
general jim beam, then.
blue suit, gray suit, i'm still a fat man. a fat ugly man.
vaaaat???
what?
the floor was wet. she slipped!
me, too.
excuse me.
...which one are you?...
how long before this car's hot?
no, i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. besides, i always travel alone.
when? approximately what year did this event take place?
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey.
quinn will be here any minute.  what are you going to say?
can't do it.  there're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  i got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and i'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  we'll get somebody else to do our betting.
my daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
that's your "rep."
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue.
yes.
yeah.  why not?
i'm a professional killer.
aye, aye.
such as.
henry, next time, couldn't mister hebbing --
mr. yelburton will be busy for some time.
i thought it would be, but just to be sure, i'll tell you that the palladists are a society of devil worshippers --
that was truly pathetic.
stop fighting and get out.
with your dry wit and humor--
...did you happen to see the front page of today's manhattan argus?
lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
won't he be able to tell?
.
i gotta memorize all this shit?
i'm not afraid of the dark.
are you going to see james tonight?
well someone's gonna find them.
standard orbit, mr. sulu.
yeah, i saw her.  bitch took my wheels.
i've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. you owe me that much. i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you, and i'm not going until you've heard me out.
what, you think the guy should change his name?
are you crazy, ray?
nothing.
don't fall for it. she lives two trailers down.
maybe you're right.
shit o dear, julian. do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
are you nuts?  they'll fry us for sure.  there's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  no way.
you took your boots off? you put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  you fuck me up over there, i'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! you understand?  go over there and apologize.  go! get the fuck out of -
hello.
ready, uncle lex?
i'll ask you one last time. do you have diss digg?
not once have i ever asked anything for myself.  i ask now.  forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
it is whispered in the forest that...  ...leondegrance's castle is under siege by lot and uryens.
i'm still can't believe you didn't tell donovan the alibi.
i'm with terry.
yeah okay. i still say frida's involved. she's the last one to see two dudes alive...
i told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. that it wasn't your fault. but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. now that i know, i won't steal any more from you. that's all i wanted to say. i'm going. 
what about it?
well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
rick stayed later after school with kristen.  she wasn't feeling very well.
you've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, mister turkle!
chill, winston, it's me and charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
oh i wouldn't think of it.
the senate too?
i got it... boss.
well then i guess we should just give up.
i did not realize it was obligatory.
one minute to warp threshold...
...so what're you doing tonight?
kit... maybe i'd better get a shovel.
will you introduce me to some worker girls?

mathesar?. .. has sarris seen the.. historical records?
then i found out hopalong cassidy had shot himself in the game room. that just blew it for me.
how about you telling me?  when i ask a simple question, i expect a straight answer.  that's what i'm used to.  anybody who doesn't give it to me, i fire.
hey, halberstam?

i said it's not worth the fight.  steward, please.
yes.  there's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. there's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
how do you put up with this greek shit?
say it.
is it because we have a test tomorrow? sometimes i get cranky when i know i have a big test to study for.
guys, what's the sitch?  i'm bored.
when do i begin?
what were you thinking coming here?
i wondered about your different accents.  i'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland.
who locked the door?
the king without his sword, the land without a king...
man, day-day is my people!
you can't trust anything these days.
no, you do, cowboy. you been to the bar?
is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, on another bug-hunt?
i said, let's go.
a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today. shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. fled the scene. don't have much on him.
so what's next?
you're the strongest woman i ever met. i love you, buddy.
so?
which one's that?  the dull, red one.
not a book fair.  i was signing autographs in a department store.
it's john, isn't it?
i'm not sure.  it seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
what is that?  what are you doing?
kalen... do you have any idea where they take them?
you're news. i want the scoop. i write it down. when i speak, no one believes me. but when i write it down, people know it's true.  there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
all right.
sorry.
no, the other hotel paraiso, in the city.  near the plaza del sol.
what's the matter, carlo?
miss mitchell, do me a favor, will you? go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
your little jack-in-the-box gun. that might be useful.
ow!
who the hell do you think you are?!
it's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  it's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  to you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.

oh my god! oh shit! phuket thailand!
take it easy, pop.
oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
no, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  we're going to have to flush it out.
well -- i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
icey, i'm worried about willa.
well, i'm sorry honey -
you give him credit for too much cleverness. my impression was that he's just another blundering american.
today is tuesday.  what?
that's another of the things i'm not so sure of.
you're going alone?
lauren murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of washington. forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. when she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. then i change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
yeah...
nick, what are you --
no, no. listen, i've been thinking --
unless the gun was slanted up.
you must think i'm pathetic.
dr. lester. . .
do you always have to call him that?  the suit? it makes you sound like such a hick.  his name is michael.
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? i have other things you might like.
yeah, he got her busted for possession...
here, babe.
boy, do i love this conflict. huh?... what the hell were you doin' in there?
you flirt with me, then you run cold.  you lead me on, then slap me down.  i don't go for being jerked around.
is everything okay?
and that is how you talk to a girl, rat. voila. you can't miss.
he's not in this class.
i can't believe we're stealing a plane.
i don't like her.
yeah, layaway.
are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
there isn't money allocated for that. but a jail--
norman.
it is not!
how're these?
the winds are picking up.
and by the way, sherman didn't even get laid.
but an oracle can.
for me?  i'll have the same thing.

how do you like our little hamlet?
it's you up on that stage, not him. you don't need him.

don't dance me, kirkhill.  you'll be walking funny.
not even of dying?
terry... terry... .
i'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
yeah...yale thing.
well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. now you don't want to hit the hay, and i don' want to get married.

no!
i pushed him too hard.
no! all you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! but i'm not you, mother, and i never will be, and thank god for it!  that goes for you too! and frankly, i don't know how, with the two of you, i turned out as sane as i am --  wait right there, gentlemen, i'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, i don't want to stay here one second longer than i have to!  but i've got to tell you, lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. in shame!
how about tomorrow? i don't mean to be pushy but --
ilsa is laszlo's wife. she probably knows things that strasser would like to know. louis, i'll make a deal with you. instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. that would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?

you know what i want?  i want you both to be friends.  i know you both, respect you both. you should be friends.
i'm having a very good time, too.
just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  no human being could do these things, right? but, this is not the devil.  it's just a man.

they put up the least amount of struggle.
she's very tired, poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.
well i don't!
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  what do you think i'm doing?
want a drink? great nap. wanna go out tonight?
and sanctuary?
would you like one?  huh?
when i wasn't so miserable i used to sell pigs. begging your pardon, i was more honest than my holy mother.
dorsia, yes?
the mains are down, sir! aux power is not responding.
i have to speak to my father.
what are you afraid of?  turn it on.
are you in a bad mood?
don't be scared, kid.  barbatus's got yer back.
bad luck, i'm afraid.  it's time to die, little bird.
you might not have done it had you known.
you're not looking at me, harry.
you're being tricked.  sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  he's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  twenty four hours a day, until they're back on earth.
no, holiness.
i don't own a television.
what if you hide me?
you missed the last three, including her birthday.  your wife's gripe sheet.
this is an emergency!
good. cos you know how it plays. six years ago, i let you go free. but the next time ... the next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
let's.
what do we do?
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway?
wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
i appreciate that. thanks a lot.
why?  oh, i'm sorry.  are you two, uh - - are?  i wish you the best luck.

you said "fuck".

just one?
let thy spirit
no, you're not wrong--
implants bothering you?
would you like another beer?
i don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
i think so.
how about some ginger pie?
what are we going to do?!  what are we going to use for money?!
i want you to hang up the suit. and i want you to stay away from vicki.
those assholes.
why was he on death row?
i wanted to fuck her, that's all!
ain't that something?!  that's just fine, baby.
will!
the nite owl was solved, lieutenant.
why not?
let's talk about us, not her.
they took the espresso machine. the <i>espresso</i> machine, jerry! which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
just behind us, over to the right.
close up shop. close up shop, hank.
i wouldn't talk.
yeah?
can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? he kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 g to bring in some guys who raped a nun. what a sick fuck. man...
right, the emperor. now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
"take-back?" what is that? i don't want a take-back. i want you to come to california with me.
if you're making fun of me, i don't like it.
yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  especially for what he said, and i quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." he helped me put out a press release.
i... you told me your name was rudy. you told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't nick --
oh, mr. gardiner, i've been looking all over.
well, i'll just make it for you.
well, yes. i did. clearly he was injured and bled.
is he all right?
more people... gotta pick up where zenovich left off. people from outside the department.
now you just lie here and have a nap.  you're exhausted.
what about her?
what did i say about mentioning that bitch?
ryan o'neal.
i thought i made myself perfectly clear.  you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it.
those trucks. i know exactly what you mean.
now, what did i do to deserve this?
i need to rent a cabin.
i don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
they requested her. it was her gig. max put me on as a favor.
you had all those cattle there, so i'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
why are you doing this?
i'm making you feel like meat?
you're all one way!  i'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... give me one of them, anyway ... just one ...
what's up?
he was hurt, but not seriously.  he'll be fine.
do you mind if i smoke, mr. garrison?
i can't take shorthand.
okay, we'll order out.
what's wrong?
is it really? i must start wearing a watch, i never do, you know... who read with miss caswell? bill?  lloyd?  well, it couldn't have been max! who?
you fell out of the tall tower you creep!
no.
i mostly work from home. i'm a composer.
moving story.
what did you say?
i've been talking about your mother... about your motel. how are you going to do it?
the doctor was called away on an emergency.  i think it was birth.
must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
get lost.
also a conductor. very brilliant. young. von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan'. furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army. the same thing happened to another critic. true or not, it's not such a bad idea. critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the russian front.  but if you really want to get furtwängler, ask him about herbert von karajan.
we can't drop it now, joe. we bought the land around this dam and we're holding it in dummy names. if we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the state under phoney names. no, joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this dam through--and get it over with.
...brainerd?
five million dollars.
you're right about that.  so this is your record collection?
i guess i owe you one.
any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
what's that?
sure, right.
jimmy? bushmills.  lookit, do me a favor. i'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
it's coming along.
i've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, susan.
oh my...  don't leave...
pension him off.
hi!
hey, let's sit down.  i bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
susie's not a virgin anymore.
interesting.
that's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i've been to you....
on the house.
i don't need you to "stick."
uh... it's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
look again for fuck sake!
all you want is a phone number?
hi...
pour your own trouble, will.
meet me at the other location.
no, henry.  i don't.
like it or not, cyrus, that's my name. cole. just like yours.
you mean hiding them?
what did it cost?
so why did you marry him?
your voice -- it's so familiar ...
split it?
no. no. stay down, marcie, sit back down on that couch --
i'd rather take my chances with them... than with francis.
i would advise you not to interfere.
an attorney?
i'm not.
how about your new friend?
wait till summer. i swear, you can't leave the house. it hurts. it physically hurts.
i'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
crabtree? he doesn't even know james.
she was talented, but honey i wish i could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, i proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
music. i think it helps if you play something he liked.
we have to find out what's happened to them. i think they're gone...
i'm bobby clowes. kansas city.
she's the captain, we should listen to --
no. no. we got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
what size?
all i want... is to make it to sidnaw, and sit down for christmas dinner. watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
you're completely demented.
what?  connie...
the band has been playing over an hour.
yes -- start in l.a. on tuesday.
it's bond!
inside information. oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? or someone overhears me saying i'm gonna buy teldar paper? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it's time to blow out xyz. you mean that?  i'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and i are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
go fix the phones.
there's a guy here on the task force right now.  maybe i should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
you alright?
sure. what's with the brick wall?
they're on the bridge. seal off the 50th floor!
let's be creative.
okay...
autograph fiends! they're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him? how could you do this?
well, it's all happenin' so fast. goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? i mean, i won! i'm the winner! i'm going to state!
i'll take care of it.
where is that sun?! it has gone behind the hill.  it is dark and cold. it has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the european masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  and le subtil is the son of his tribe. there have been many clouds and many mountains. but now he has come to lead his nation.
for you.
rapidamente! everybody in the world is going to see!
huh? wha...
the hood jumper?
anywhere you want?
we can't survive this, sir.  they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt.
not her, the one with the little...
oh--saunders--
to avenge his father, and the others.
your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
are you okay?
what?  but you been working so hard --
this shall be your cell, mary clarence.
she's the best poker player you ever saw.  my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt.  finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night. he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  and he bluffs?  he had sixteen levels of bullshit.  her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. every saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. and i'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time i was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  that's why i'm such a good officer, i can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, i know just what cards to deal him.
to tell you the truth -- you did.
twenty-five.
you'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
...ok... good.
right.
good morning, captain pierce and captain forrest.
brilliant. hey, you heading out a little early today?
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
yes you do.  something's on with you.  you're sleeping with her, aren't you?
if you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
that's up to your guy on the boat.  seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. make sure he got it right.
soon.
i ought to break your damn neck.
i have to ask you for that key.
okay, thanks.
believe me, the man's gonna be real happy.  looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
i wouldn't do that, fettes.  i wouldn't report it.
mr. kane is finishing it.
push off toward us.
what is the matter with him?
while you're cleaning up, i'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
only a pig would say that!
i'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
but tor, it's a starring part! you're second billed.
the way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
i know why you're so secretive. why you won't let anybody near you.  i know what he did to you.
got anyplace special in mind?
where are you meeting this person?
the presidency.  the public loves him.
he's here.
i used to wear this to the garden. garbage strikes. dog shit. muggers.  ship it.
mm.
don't call me a bum! i ain't no bum!
why? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  i won't get shocked. i'm used to this!  my father was a true pig. he fucked the bitch i'd as mother all around the apartment. whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  and my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
ever since that phony phone call from the president.  look at this. what is it?
that's a crock! if one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
vhy do you persecute me?  my papers are in order.  i love my country.  "oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber vaves of grain."
that guy is totally amazing.
why not?
i'm sorry. i thought i was to be the light. but why do i confuse you? am i so strange?
i tried to save him! i was desperate to save him! he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
who is this?
i'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
not yet, major.  not yet.
god, i can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
i've considered that.
i knew it. i knew it wasn't true. boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
... i am the personification of everything they have rejected.
i know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
mortals, mortals everywhere. and lots of drops to drink.
god.
unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
good morning, mother. didn't i tell you that he'd be marvelous. everybody thought he was so charming last night.
where?
yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. i've heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium?
yes, general.  but if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
hmmm, a lesbian, are you? i must inform you that i find that highly arousing.
then there was jerry, the actor.
you gotta loosen up, my friend. you'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
first time in a grav couch?
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. where has it been laid out?
if you pull this off, i can't promise i won't kill you.  i mean, who we trying to kid?  but i will spare the flying nun here....
where are you?
i can wait. where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night...
nothing ... you shouldn't have given victoria that guinness.
in the middle of all the pain?
that's it?
damn... are you alright?
her favorite uncle
on the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
until now.
our little island seems to agree with you....
this is june twentieth?
i just told you.
time, pilch! my move.
you're making a big --
this is flynn... the one who busted me out.
hell is other people.  you obviously don't read much. besides things seem pretty quiet here.  you should thank god you didn't die in italy.  the deetzes.  okay.  have you been studying the manual?
that's what the two policemen said, sir.
well, why not? the captain on a ship can. it doesn't seem fair that... hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
i've always been a heel. i guess i always will be.
well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
good morning, vanessa! i hope you have on clean underwear.
listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. if you did know, you were in on it. either way, you're out!  get out! go on.  let's go.
they gave me a free jacket at the door.
what are you talking about?
it's not your decision and he's not your brother, dignan.
it says she was originally schooner rigged, but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  i think square rigs look so much more romantic.
the only real truth is in the work.
he's dead.
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to shout...
you sure about that?
what could you find in this place?
i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
yeah? what do you want?
exception!
yeah, that's right.
i'm not sure.  i've never seen anything like it.
to see if he can get away with it.
how can i go on? i feel so... responsible.
sure.
difficult ... to say.
it wouldn't matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon. it wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
excuse me --
what's that you're playing?
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
you sure you didn't say anything to maya?
are you talking about me?
yes. that is surprising.
is mr helpmann here?
but on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
i have seen it, but i don't remember this part.  funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  the movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
you're so famous now.
yeah.
what are you talking about?
we're building up tourism, sam--
who else have you told?
we're getting down to the wire. apparently another company has a similar product in r&d right now. if they beat us to it...
i can't guarantee that...
you come stealee tleasoo?
we'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
call me laurie, will ya?
come on, come on, you yellow belly. the whole thing. first name and last name.
the lifeline is divided that way.
...who...?
could i have that in american?
...no, i've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  maybe it's a personal pain. at any rate, i don't believe good work is possible without it.
as in, your ass is dead in the water.
jesus!
is she coming back?
no...
a plague o' both your houses.
it's just like coming out of a tree house.  did your dad ever build you a tree house, tim, eh?
fine by me, sir!
i have to do something.
as for the author... shoot him.
in fact, in fact, in fact, i'm not sure if i'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  that's the truth.  the truth's best, don't you think?
yes. how did...
it's amazing, us running into each other like this. maybe it's fate.
but aren't you the least bit curious about it, doctor?  doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
eleven to seven he blows it.
ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  when does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
what do i do, dad?
look at that!  yeah!  come and get some, boy!
quite so.  narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve rome...
you gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  think you can handle it?
well, not to say mr. lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
have you ever loved anyone?
dr. lecter, you find out everything. you couldn't have talked with this "william rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... you made him up, didn't you?
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
i love you.
yeah?
how's your uncle?  i hardly ever see him anymore.
i don't know.
god, you drive me crazy. i just want you to know how i feel and you don't understand.
why?
i don't think those cops did iris. i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her.
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. it may take a few days, but you're going back.
it's... it's not that simple to explain. i know you think it is, but it's not. the truth is, i don't really know what i want to do. i don't have all the answers.
thank you, annette. chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years. does your family do much riding?
come on, let's go.
what am i gonna do?  i jog, i do the exercises on tv in the morning... gravity...
good.
you don't like coconuts! say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? lookit here –– from tahiti –– fiji islands, the coral sea!
let's get the fuck out of here!
shouldn't you lie down?
you ought to take up crap shooting. talk about luck!
bandit ii?
we've been discussing that.  he wants to go to the riviera - but i sort of lean toward niagara falls.
ichabod...
but sir, what can i say to her? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
oh, yes, mr. preysing?
that's swell!
for who?
hey stud:  i thought we had something together.
come on, gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
and you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
cuter again.
and?
you're even sadder and more burnt- out than i thought.
do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
good. remember, when in doubt: don't ever do what you really want to do.
i have to go to new york tomorrow.
i'm saying it because it's true. inside of us we both know you belong with victor. you're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. if that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
oh dear, i didn't really mean to...
did you see it here in new york?
are they suffering?
what's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
twenty-five? around there.
a man of some travels.
mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
yeah.
it was .... the emperor ....
i already know you think you're worthless.  i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  i haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
mr. thaddeus rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
what happened?
of course, the slaughtered lamb. why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
injected windex!  why would he switch to a new m.o.?
mmmmmmmmmm! mmmmmmmmmmmm!
you take care.
killed outright?
come on. tell us, shitface.
yes.  cathy lee crosby stayed here.
well, what is it about? tell us the story.
nothin'.
i know...
no gun.
might be a good time to try using it again.
i will be the judge of that.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  they know where to come when they need us.  i realize this during the war...world war ii...vito genovese... during wwii he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
now, lydia... favor us about your ghosts.
what are you talking about?
which way?
what's the matter with you! gettin' yellow?
look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. i'll do whatever you want. but you gotta let me go. you can't do this! you can't keep me here!
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  his parents are at his bedside.  fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"...
well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
you can go first, bob.
now they feel it...down below.
and that truck - is it registered in your name?
i'm afraid not.
your phone's ringing, dude.
mafia warlords, diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  a nice little rat’s nest.
we thought we were something, didn't we?
i was a friend of your sister's.
deadbeats all.
-- what were they doing there?
now i got you for a witness, i'm going to try again. so far all i dragged out of him is he's from bahston and he's only been in the army two months.  where were you when they drafted you?
me??
well, i'll see you at the next staff party.
okay, that's all folks.  commissioner gallagher has to go.
yes. they refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
i want the money, mark, that's all.
nyah, you've done more than enough.  even the best of snake charmers get bit.
let's say for example -
what?
you're kidding yourself.  an adult t-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  it acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
naw. they paroled me.
fine. what's, uh, what's on your mind?
joe, cut it out.  and you too, drew.
i should hope not.  i hate you!
he knows what he's doing.  he's worn before... a lot.
you have to save this boy. good exists in this world. i can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
hey -- i didn't know you were here. it's okay.  we got the refrigerator in. come see.
i dunno.  that little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
and how does one do that?
they're more afraid of you.
higher.  higher.
look, i'm sorry.  you were gone.  i just assumed you were off having fun.
he's preaching.
penrhyndeudraeth, north wales.
i got the part on "t.j. hooker".
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
how about a check?
thanks, chuck.
why?  what are you going to do?!
you worry too much, stevens.  i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
what does it look like?  it's an address book!
actually, yeah--
that's not the point. we're just not in love anymore.
hello. gerald lambeau, m.i.t.
yes sir.
you ok?
are you apprehensive?
according to bembridge scholars, inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing the book of the living.
one day, lad, all this will be yours ...
ray. x22.
it's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
-- but he does seem very nice.
then what?
no. it's all right. i just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
so how was school today?

and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i don't say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?'  so i says, 'well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
i guess we could go to disneyland or something.
what is it, doctor? what's happening?
no, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? you guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. you are into yourselves, as the saying goes. spend some time trying to be parents. take him to the mountains, fishing. you ought to let him get to know nature.
how do i find them?  their offices are empty.
sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american.
what?
i don't know exactly. i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... i thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
just wondering.
this ain't no game, miz lampert.
jim --
no, i'm not playing this game.
splendid! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
that's him! he did it!
any sign of santa?
it's always been like that.  when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i'd better...take precautions.  i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
i'm just going to my car.
dylan, it's breakfast.  not arts and crafts  what?
the old-high-school-heartthrob sheriff. i thought you were crazy about each other. he's available, you're available--

sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that's it.

the one you work with. who is he? how do you do it?
--and we will--
... including me.  right?  
how?
and the argies.
sir, i know it was wrong. i didn't learn from one mistake and i made another, sir.  sir, my family... my whole family was in buenos aires, sir.
i guess we all did.  you know, i didn't marry leslie because i loved her. i married her to forget you...
a man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
a elephant seal. where's mommy?
shit.
are you still coming?
sure, you do what ya want. stay away from the stock market.
all right, brother. then you can go to some nice warm place, and i don't mean california.
yeah.
come aboard.
we all played the field.
the ship will sink.
m'sieu laval!

please, mr. cedar!  proceed.
i mean it.  take care of it.

they're talking to themselves.
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."

when i'm talking to children.
you're really doing a great job here, josie. i like your "can do" attitude.
what about?
you're using theo for your own deviant purposes!
mozart, are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
heh, heh, heh!  golly bob howdy --

you're forgiven. bye now.
you're not going to fail me are you?
i'm not going to do it.
why not?
his wife's?
on a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
the car doesn't vanish evan. the movie in your head has broken, that's all. but now i've re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car.
he was slow.  very simple.  they won't all be that easy.

who wants true? who wants moving?
do you like my body?
i suppose. why?
i know... 'out in the good air...'
uh-huh.
never mind.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  i'm thinking now it's the way i'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
where?
yo!
all these years you've kept those things buried down here? in our own house?
how're you doing?
you know i feel ridiculous i didn't mention them yesterday -- i clean forgot -- ridiculous.
were you expecting anyone? tonight?
zukovsky...
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of superman's hair!
what are their feelings?
mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!

where is she?
bad luck to see death in the snow.
no!!!!!
i wouldn't know. just do it somewhere else. there is such a thing as good manners.
she drank too much. that's what killed her.
will you tell mom when she gets home from the hospital that i've gone to dinner at sandy williams' house?
who did cause and origin?
there's just one more thing.
great, thanks for the tip.
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
so.
where?
no... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m.p.'s --
well, i'll tell you, aunt theresa...

and i see what you mean. you nearly poked my eyes out.
why can't you be nice to me?
it is new, it is, isn't it, sire?
maybe we should just wait here? hide in a tree?
i guess.
i work in a shitty video store. i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie.
what the hell does this have to do with insurance?
you guys have fun?
just about anything i want, it looks like. this is gonna be tough, though. there's no way to save this game. i gotta get it right the first time through.

i am in school.
mister mcmurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
didn't he tell you what you wanted?
what the hell is going on?!
did you give him a full cavity search?
that's right.  lauren.
what? what?!
mike, this is fantastic.  i mean, you're responsible for building all this.  what a job you've done! maybe i'll quit school and come down here and work with you. brody brothers construction. we've always wanted to do that together.  boat building.
can i be anyone i want?
ginger... it means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. now, i -
i thought of that, with the filters from the clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. after that, we'd better be on our way home.
what kind of gun was it?
dwight chapin, nixon's appointments chief--he knew segretti in school. maybe i'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. what were the three theories?
oh
really?
is this the place?
what's that?
...that man's takin' his job too serious.
how about another one?
i don't know about you, but i'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
you're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud.
ahh, why don't i come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
and you have this letter of intent?
i'm worried, ray.  it's getting crowded in there.  and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
-- it was "la belle aurore."
so, then, you're, like, available?

we got evicted from our home. we've both been on the streets for the last week.
i feel like shit.  me and my frigging nosebleeds.
back in school. never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
you'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
i'm not going to report it.
admiral janeway. good to see you.
you missed fourth amendment law. unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. where were you all afternoon?
make love?
yes.  and a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. everything is the same, george, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
buggered?
we don't need him...
mm-hm. i'm a big girl. i can take care of myself. if i didn't want to be here, i'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for chinese food.
gus, this --
yeah.  sure.  why not.  call me at the regent beverly wilshire.
don't touch it!  that's li mu bai's sword.
because i love it so. it's beautiful there. especially at sunset.  ah... thank you for the fire.
gracious, gracious! you are a good woman, miz cooper!
i don't know what to think, marlon. maybe i'm going out of my mind, but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
i'm not wearing a bra.
sure.  more money in intelligence on their side of the border.  so we have a better idea who we're looking for.  more dogs.  more people. supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  but, i should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  in the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  what does that tell you?
well, actually, i thought i'd run an idea by you.  you know, just to see if you're interested.
what?!
so you may have been duped this whole time. killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
bret. what the hell is going on?
ta.  ta.

i'm so tired...
i'm dreaming.
i've heard some foolish things in my life.
sorry. you've lost me...
well, that's all. you will see. today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "hey, ma, it's no good being a single man. i'm tired-a running around." then he's gonna say, "hey, ma, wadda we need this old house? why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? a nice little apartment?"
give it a rest ned, huh?
you said he had two days' start. that he would blend in. disappear!
we've met before, y'know, that white house function, the president had you on his right and you know where i was?
i didn't say it was rational, i just said i was convinced.
lufkin. his... agent.
i don't owe them a goddamn thing.
i thought i was the bad guy!
big family... small?
looks a little constipated to me.
is the hostage injured?
no, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
for three dollars a day, that's what i'm doin' it for. i got two little kids. i got a wife and my wife's mother. them people got to eat. fust and on'y thing i got to think about is my own folks. what happens to other folks is their lookout.
making sure that no one can get in here.
i told you but you wouldn't listen. you never listened to me.
we all know what happened.  in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
we have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...so we can swim to it....
right.
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. anything.  don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that i can see, not on the outside.
how'd you come by this?
i'm showing summer rentals.  we got a helluva season going.
-- uh... buzz, i'm sorry, i -- buzz, you gotta forgive me! i shouldn't a fired you, i didn't know what i was doing! i was a little funny in the head, i --
you must come with me.  it's much too late already.  you must come with me to the graveyard.
small moves, captain, small moves.
not a good idea. someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. raymond, you'll steal one.
...i'm going to kiss you.
is jack upset that he can't be here?
did you hit her?
i got hit.  i can't believe it. i got shot.
one of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
yes.
who are you?
how about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
yes, i have.
i feel like i've been mugged... guy scared the shit out of me. you made your point, eddie... i'm relieved we're not taking the case.
no -- they don't.
catherine!
you're terrible crude sometimes, sailor, you know?
what is your name?
your father the cop. that's a good one.  forget fred krueger. you don't want to know, believe me.
you don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
yep. everything settled.
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality?
huh huh huh. that was cool.
hers.
woody!  buzz!
ellie.  pulsar?
yes -- insulin and others.
don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
it's a post all vienna seeks. if you want it for your husband, come tonight.
noel, you didn't let me finish. we have rules against killing people on the street. looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. a nice quiet room with a big bed.
it might just be the age. i spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
sid fletcher.
...it's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
deserts you?  harry said he'd take over for me.
okay, that's no problem.
it's a hotel.
how do i know if this is love ?
how do you know?  how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  you're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us!
we haven't got much time left, mr. dickson. we've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
louise?... the maid?...  but she should have left earlier today...
where am i? and how can i leave?
if anything ever happens to me...
if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? the thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. if it doesn't, then it's no good.  i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
am i?
for coming onto my property... with a gun.
how did you see me?
i suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
it's true.  there's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. nevertheless... jeanne has done so much for us...
you're going to use walter?
who the hell are you anyway ? what is this place ?
i couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...jesus, i'm starting to believe in god and what's worse i think i like the guy. the lightning bolt was just a test, right?  wendy and i--we're meant to be. i'm right, right?  i have to see her...
i see.
so, does tricky dick know about this?
you've been there?
you'd be surprised how often they are.
you, sister...
go on.
you guys are my parents.
now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
he wouldn't kill anybody...
i think he's been sick. he's alright now, but i think he's been very, very sick.
what the fuck?!
come on, sugar - time to change for dinner.
no, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
okay - you got your one.
you...you're an american?
...is that not true?
you just relax. nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
he's in a mental institution.... he's been there for ten years, off and on. mostly on.
who we are. don't you think they're going to be pissed?
do it for you.
no, i can't. you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeat-it's lovebeat," by little tony defranco and the defranco family. i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade.
there is no boom-boom room.
stuttering--
c'mon, jack. you had a few drinks.
i thought you were out of cigarettes.
i don't have to.  i run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. i can't help that.  besides, they all know i'm married to his niece.  i've got to think of her.
so, he's playing hard ball. well, two can play that game.  go after him. stop at nothing. you hear me?
yes, my lord.
then we're stupid and we'll die.
can't you fix him up here? ...he's my livelihood. listen.
i didn't get a thing.  just the music lessons.  that's all there was to it.
no father. it's nothing like that, father. it's about this new thing they're all talking about. about this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
i don't know his first name.
i brought you a present. merry christmas.
somewhere.
got your sensors?
we need this guy.
we know.
why are you here. whatiya want?
hiya, phyllis.  these are the revlon contracts.  i thought you ought to check them out.
good. you can do whatever you like with these.
are you sure?
-- oh, sure. a hairdresser. how... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
you wounded me first, marylin.
charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
how we doing, colonel?
shall i call the police, sir?
well, i called erica's beeper. there's just no answer.
god, he hardly even talks anymore.
so we just pretend none of this ever happened. we never met. we --  -- you're going to get yourself killed, bruce. you know that, don't you?
captain, we can't trust anyone now.
in a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
you should hope quite a while.
don't, no, please.  will you-- no, don't...
great.
why?  what's wrong?
that was such a great evening.
jessica, i'm so sorry.  i...i wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
ok, i will.  the bad news is the ship is history.  life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
so what are you doing with your life now, son?
you think applejack knew?
he's a very stubborn man sometimes...
oh yeah, i guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
well, we're fbi agents.
i've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. it's an even ten who say shu's gun killed jimmy chin!
let her go. she'll be ok.  sorry about that.
that's right -- you got the bill this morning.  i put it on your desk.
you see?  being an ant is being able to say, "hey -- <u>i'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
i can't work in a vacuum. why don't you make hendricks chief? his family's been here since the puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
why do you think --
what does that mean?
that's true -- but the emotion is still there.  they just learn to control it.
it's freezing out.
oh -- mrs. lieberman.
i'm rambo.  this is brewer.  her name is co.
how much did you pay?
not supposed to talk about it.
i'm fine. just a few bruises.
what's the matter, don't you want to hear our singing?
we did it!
well.
this is sweet!!
she's in icu.
i'm not.
i'll introduce you.
must've been a defective puck.
well, actually, it's the same, but longer. i think it's better. more...raw.
did i say "if"?
he is a porter. he wants to carry them.
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
who are you?  what do you want?
what's going on, harry?
i saw that colonel's huey on the point --
the academy, then ciiac.
andy!
buckaroo, you got a minute--?
you turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
you're late.
i'll bet you have some good ideas.
get your clothes off!
i am so sorry about your men.
oswald:  we need one more thing.
i can't talk right now.
sshh... it's okay.
let me get you another glass of wine.
-- is not a challenge. i need something i can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
how about that one? the host of the old south hotel.
you wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
this room sucks.
well, i'd really hope to rent it for...
weird and tiny huh?
i don't think the color of the interior is....
what is it?
where are you taking me!?
and don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
yeah?
so i'm like, 'maybe i'm not on the list cause i'm not a fuckin persian.'
where?
what did he do this time?
no. is he sick?
no grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. but we make due. to your charms.  skol.
go-go-go-go-go!!!!
i... i don't know what you mean, sir.
dr. danielson, the man we want was never your patient. it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. please, doctor - time is eating us up. just show me the ones you've turned away.
snake - what is it?
chet won't know anything.  we'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
no mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, i got it under control.
so what's unique?
well, then ask her, dumb ass.
i could have given you the world.
hey!  that's a <u>prototype</u>!
i bet that's all the hacks they send out.  otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
thank you very much.
all right, so i'm primitive. so what d'you want with me?
what?
these look kind of familiar.
damn! what are the odds?
could you ever conceive of going there, tom, and bringing him back?
oh, you have group 7 access, don't you?
nice doggie. good boy.
i can explain ...  i was in the forest ... riding north from camelot ... when i got this note.
my mother. died in '72. they told me after. they said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
alright sid, over there is the stab 3 production offices. that's where sarah darling was murdered last night.
o'clock?
am i keeping you? i'm sorry.
yeah, i heard a lot about you.
yes.
get rid of 'em.
this is all that survived?
we're going up the tower, madeleine.
who?
if all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  how am i supposed to survive?  i'm giving birth in three months.  how do i get through this?
no scars?
good morning.
wait, did you say wife?...are you fuckin' married!!?
what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight?
look at you.
is that why you say it's horrible?
why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
so could i.
that's what he says. i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
gonna be le hot shit.  pardon my francais.  dance club.  the resurrection brothers play there.  heard of them?
trust me; do as i ask.
she said they were from her old convent.
rose, are you all right? are you sick or something?
oh-
you could help me find her. you know the people.  i'll pay you a hundred dollars.
back.  neck.  back.
what made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  she'd never won a bloody thing.
you mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
someone recommend you?
...and you're going to do that?
and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
you got no know-how. about indian way. or about jack shit for that matter.
we can't sing without her!  what should we do?
her name's mayfield. betty mayfield.
well, marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
your brother was a client with our london branch.  we do a sort of informal scoring.  his numbers were outstanding.  sure you're not hungry at all... ? tung hoy, best in chinatown...
well, he's pretty quiet. except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  but boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower. loves french fries. eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. i'm proud to have him.
what?
then was it worth it?
c'mon...
that was a pretty backhanded compliment. if i let people get away with things like that, i wouldn't be a good salesman.
sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell i'm talkin' 'bout.
i dunno.  where's erica mother?
what?
yes, general savitzky?
diane!  alright, let's stop this right now.  let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  this isn't even smart thinking.
is there a problem here?
davidoffs. i get 'em in mexico. they're hard to find here. i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
maybe i don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but i don't work the same way.
on the bed!
look, will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
to recover the mind set.
it's just... y'know... i mean...
john mason.  ' don't be shocked.  i don't have much time.  please listen carefully  ....
you humbug!
nice looking group.
i mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. i was gonna tell you but marcel wouldn't let me.
i'm not really dressed for a party.
and you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  you've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  but, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
my body?  i'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  good night, doc.
yeah.  i really admire the guy.  well. good to meet you.
well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is ramblin'.
shut up.  i'm rich.  i'm richer than all this new hollywood trash. i've got a million dollars.
i'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
i won't, mom.
listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? this is a matter of principle. something you probably wouldn't understand.  when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
i've only shown this to three other people. i bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. i keep the coordinates in this room.  it's left over from sdi. reagan's star wars technology? they orbit 426 miles up.
huh?
i don't understand.
yeah, i guess.
are you kidding?... i've got so much on andy, it isn't funny.
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
but he also wrote --
i don't want to know.
did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
you and frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
i don't understand.
not at first. you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. any second i thought you would take off and fly.
i'm not taking you there, sweetie. rule number one in north america: no strangers in the car.
home.
so what i want to do is stop it here. i'm going to make him an offer. i want to do it myself. i want it to come from me.
well, austin, you've stopped dr. evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
i don't know, melanie.  look, do you have to go back to annie's?
don't make this like a counsel, lloyd. i got statistics i can show you, i got graphs i can show you.  that's all the stuff i can show you, it all says the same thing.  you have to decide on a career.
no you won't.
can i feel 'em?
did you know your mother better?
oh... i have some questions.
come on. i wancha to meet a frienda mine. raymond, get enough beer for ben too.
i'm not mad at you.  okay, i'm not mad at you.
you don't understand. i want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... my wife tells me you put a move on darien. here's some inside info for you. that euroflash gq guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. exit visas are imminent. so don't lose your place in line.  oh, jeez, i wish you could see this. the lights coming up over the water. i've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." i like you sport, i ever tell you that... gordon, call me gordon from now on.
yes, but i, well, <u>you</u> know...
how far do we go with this?
you whaaaaaat?  you paid it?  you gave a bondsman ten percent?
-- i work for the city.
how drastic?
when's the arraignment?
i can do that.
westley, what about the r.o.u.s.'s?
then all you have to do is untrigger it.
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor?
and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.
there's nothing to understand. the guy is a pig.
you're not sleepy?
well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, dude.
that was sure swell ...
are we goin' home, john?
leave her out of this.
i knew tom never wrote that letter.
just one.
get the kids out!
it must be hard, being so far away from her.
no.  it won't do.
paisley porter. i didn't know you were waiting tables.
you told me.  i've got to run, jeff.
he's going to be in jail for a long time.
we have to go back for daddy!
so that's what love is?
here's my theory. twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. finds out his son-in-law is involved.
he's comin' back?. what for?
who'd you see, sam? the man on the floor?
huh? oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
you only brought one ball?!
it's probably just a strained muscle.
hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
what's the weather like outside?
i done et just a little bit ago.
get your head back in the game. there are lives at stake here.
get the... midnight... express.
saw who?!
that gives you an idea of what i'm up against!
hey, rene.
barnett?
who is he?
gardner?  oh, um -- he's a new student. just moved here.  why?
you're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
look, it's three am.  these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  you better start cutting them some slack.
i heard you got attacked.
for talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... they haven't spoken to this day.
...oh barton, i feel so... sorry for him!
dil! dil! what the fuck are you doing here?
what did he want?
oh yes... very.
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
i don't understand, patrick.  you haven't done anything asinine this week. are you not feeling well?
you must have come a long way.
and therefore?
in many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. it's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
i'm going in after him.
i didn't see her... and i didn't hear from her! believe that!
you're not going in.  that's exactly what he wants.  as long as you're on hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
i mean they want to get caught.
extract of pineal!
off the record.
no.  i don't even know why i do it.
what? steve seemed to put up with warren.
just thought i'd...
what's his name?
what's the problem, molly?
you gotta calm down, paden. everything will be put straight in a few days.
these are all from me.
something bothering you?
no.
ya.
something bad.  is that all the music? i don't want to hear this stuff...
my, my, what a coil we're in! what's this all about?
stay out of it, sefton.
what's involved, aside from putting up the money? what're you looking for the partner to do?
oh my god, oh my god...
so?
where are you going?
you know, i had an apartment about this size once.
- - like birds - -
it was called 'slave of love' when i bought it. next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
hello, leon darling!
who is she?
how do you do.  my name is penelope ryan.  this is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
i'll be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?
marsco went belly-up on the dow jones.
i am not a good singer.
and the blood let you out?
then you should not have sought an explanation.
a belgian priest by the name of father perrault, the first european to find this place, and a very great man indeed. he is responsible for everything you see here. he built shangri-la, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. in fact, shangri-la is father perrault.
i don't understand any of that.
where?
now what?
mary robert.  i'm... mary robert.
works for me.
twenty-five wives!
poor thing.  is she all right?
train goes at four minutes past twelve. you've just got time.
i don't know what you want, but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
stop it. you are blowing a great opportunity here, miles. fucking maya, man. she's great. she's cool. she's funny. she knows wine. what is this morose come-down bullshit? these girls want to party. and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, vouvrays? i mean, come on!
charles.
larry, i'm gonna kill him.
me first.
yes.
don't worry. i'm not telling anybody about this.
all craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
then answer the question. same category.
whose room was this?
besides, we don't know the city and--
sounds swell... i'm really touched. and my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. we're still gonna go bowling on tuesdays, play cards on fridays and wear women's clothes on sunday night. i love you guys... i always will.
hello. hello.
moonby what?
curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  mother's love, jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  it's bad luck!
your father is julian cross, isn't he?
it's all over, j.d. help me to stop it.
it's no secret, i know all about the party - eve wrote me...
you go?  not watch fun?
yeah, her name's kavlova, why?
yes!
sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  i'm a very good singer, man --
a little bit. but i didn't really want her to.
why do you do it?
i see.
changing the sparks.  they showed it on tv.  what d'you think?
you get nothing from me about haldeman?
it's your fan mail, little sister.
i'll take you tomorrow... you must have seen a lot on your journey.
come on.  yeah. you know what? you know, i like you, i really mean it. i really do like you.
where's the head?
well, a gal a day is enough for me. i couldn't handle any more.
this doesn't make any sense.
don't bring it home in this.
we can't reach that!
com'on, just say it. try it on for size.
larry? we've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for vp, treasurer and secretary. mr. hendricks and i have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
niki. calm down. relax. let's just talk for a while. then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
he went down to the lobby for a minute. he should be right back.  would you like come in?
you know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
you don't know many of citizen barras' friends, do you?
human children can be very beautiful.  getting married?  congratulations. you will be taking sunday off, then...
shut up, all of you.
lost something?
johnny, it's the only way.
she's not here right now.
what's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
hide.  run to the ends of the earth till you learn.  you must learn to defend yourself.  in this i can help.
this is bullshit, george.  we're never going to find anything down there.
i'm sorry, ma'am?
there's a lot of funny things down this way, louis.
well, it's a living. but i'm excited about this.
hello.
take it slowly.
hey, i know that, hey, i'm <u>kidding</u>...  "it's a pageant"
where is she?
but, edward...
there must be something i can do, something i can say to make this up to you?...  just tell me what it is, i'll say it.  i'll do it. i don't want you to hate me.
i won't take much of his time.
i can't tell you how much i admire you. you have a wonderful way with people. and you're very insightful. i feel like you've seen me clearly... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. you've made that possible for me.
do it again.
i don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
where the hell is he?
monsieur blaine, i wonder if i could talk to you?
who was that man?
she's going through a really rough time right now.
syracuse.
no.
yeah, but, when i was walking, i realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. he's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? he's not free. he's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
you sent my assistant on an errand.
or her name?
what the fuck you think, i wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? yeah you're working. and put down the champagne.
no. no, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, i can't think of any words. would "great" be insulting?
that's alright. i already ate lunch. i actually wouldn't mind getting a gelati.
lay off the bennies, leo.
murder.
donut, get your camera. see if it's broke.
juno, what's the matter?
i hear you've got visitors.
it's okay. can i sit down?
what did he say?
yeah, right -- i really have to go to bed.
well, what does it have to do with? us?
is it you?
this is some heavy shit. this is like lone ranger-heavy man. fuck it! there's so much shit that pisses me off. you guys should recruit 'cause i am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
alfredo died. do you remember him?
ah yes, a music lover.
but why? eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. a cloud of radiation the size of europe...
that is correct.
love you, man.
we're under attack.
mr. dobisch said that?
i'll call.
you're really cramping my style here.
oh, for christ's sake –-
we're ok.
don't you use olives?
yes... it's called an echo.  the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs.
you wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
he's from southie? how many people did you try before you came to me?
it's loaded with what?
listen, i know i've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? he's private property. i've been waiting years for him to develop.
how did you have a baby?
yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which i still cannot believe.
oh, good...
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi's forum sketches.
have you reported to your probation officer as directed?
this isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. there's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in new york is reading it now. so if you want me to burn it, fine. you're not ridding the world of anything.
guilty on a reduced charge. hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. you seen it. plain filth.
we're closed, sir.
what is this, rogoff?
so...you hang out here a lot?
oh my god.  what happened?
it was lucy!  lucy went to the cops!
we did no impact evaluation.  the consequences of...
i love it.  she's got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
jake...
no sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. i remember dates. names. numbers. i saw him on november 28th.
oh yeah. musk, or something. you like it?
hello, billy.
you know.
ten dollars. i'll find a way to pay you back. how would you like to know about somewhere special? the perfect beach. paradise. no one else knows about it. that's got to be worth something. what do you say?
meaning?
the xk 101. luthor, that operates on radio waves. and with our fail-safe system, only the president himself can push that button.
she was very pretty.
did you watch it yet?
johnnie, i can't tell you, honey. is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? we've got to find them kids.
we'll exterminate the fuckers !
yup. hey, um, so, um, listen, man, i got to go show the tape to danny at the hotel, and if i get the gig, erica is gonna teach me how to surf in l.a.
will you come to him on your knees?
questions about sex.
beer and weed is what i've got.
mother and father know best.
i think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. why, i wouldn't believe it if i heard it in an english monastery. why should i swallow it here in tibet?  how do you know the things they told you are true? did they show you any proof?
don't gas me, fink. if you're opinion mattered, then i guess i'd resign and let you run the the studio. it doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum. so let's put a stop to that rumor right now.
you call what you did bad?!  you knocked her up and then left her!
"have to"? no...
that's what i'm doing.
if i wanted ta kill ya, i woulda done it long ago. it's not like you ain't given me reason.
not yet, jeff.
i didn't think you'd show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.
i'll be in touch.
just one.  the bar's closed.
there were many men interested in you?
i know.
you're not from around here, are you?
give it here, bernard.
i am ready now...
on my life, i promise you i will.
i ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. if you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
she's in my biology class.
i don't know.
well, i stalled him for a while. when it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  okay?
nothin' complex about it. del's dead, betty's gone. she's probably dead, too.
there's something through that wall!
look, i can understand if you and foley are close.
pacifica, california... that's a long ways away.
oh. uh. hello. i -- i have these. for you.
you mean like in the steam room?
and you got to him before we could.
is something wrong?
have <u>you</u> lost him?
what's this?
i get headaches. mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. she knew things that nobody else knew.
here... in front of this oak, facing north.  horrible...
no micheal did. it was an accident.
look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' patriots' games and still workin' construction, i'll fuckin' kill you. and that's not a threat, that's a fact. i'll fuckin' kill you.
who?
i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or don't i get to... is there some...
how about in the house?
can you isolate the wave?
<u>me</u>!
i love you.
what?  what is it?
...i just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
here!  i've got an order!  let me have...
i would like some fresh straw.
you know where they get this fertility stuff?  they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns.
ten?
yeah?  what rule of thumb is that?
hello, john.
good evening, your highness.
lizy, eliza... elizabeth bennett...  pride and prejudice.
then how do you know he sells guns?
well then, perhaps you also ---
well, that's a long time.
i never scared anyone before.
what did he have to do -— look at the body?
well it's about time. looks like you found yourself a helper too.
come on, do you think i'm doing the right thing? tell the truth. you've been through it.
i killed too many barbarians.
listen, have i ever done anything really stupid?
you know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
i need thirteen.
i thought you said the eggs weren't...
i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
how'd you people happen to pop in?
did you have to sign a pledge? not to go back to the line?
i want you to remember if you can a night last january. the night sister paul died. do you remember.
merry christmas to you, sir...
mm, you want to steal it? 
take all the time you like, doctor.
that was sue. we got two parties tonight. one's for a modeling agency.
...i'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
yeah?
i don't know.  i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
i wasn't done, i was just sick of hearing him whine. and you didn't take him out, you scalped him. christ, i almost puked, did i tell you that?
right.
maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
and how long will you be away?
he already knew it.
shut up!!!
it's actually kind of serious, dave. i'm afraid the president's not in very good shape.
did you sleep well?
attractive...
it's not here. maybe the police are still holding it. their forensic people...
can we see the scene with the music back, please?
no i'm serious.  it's. it's just i don't know i. i'm looking for something else.
your wife?
i don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
they made me go with them.
where do they take them?!
here. let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
hello, peter.  you played an interesting game last night.  even though sacrificing your queen at b-5 is the game i played against valsney in '82.  i'm glad it helped you.
this doesn't make sense.
take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
if it were up to the doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
what you going to do?
once you're in it, it warms up.
she's right. this is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
what?!
well, i hope you enjoyed yourself.
this frightens me -- because i'm starting to feel things i haven't felt in a long time.
we just got a gold record.
will you take it easy!
a moonstone.
i don't want to hear about it jackson.
are you familiar with kirshner?
hey, i was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'don't tread on me'.  you know, and a picture of the earth.
but she mentioned beaumont by name?
don alonso de bobadilla.
okay. indo-china. tuesday. we'll pick you up.
you're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
give your father the benefit of the doubt.  talk to him.  let him see who you are.
what's that?
yeah, well, that's what i do too.
then why are you doing it? how much better can you eat? what can you buy that you can't already afford?
i don't want to talk about it! thelma, i'm not kidding!  don't you even...
peter, you're bleeding.
no.
but i did leave you, uncle henry -- that's just the trouble.  and i tried to get back for days and days.
what's the matter with her?
even my own wife, chief,  who's wondering where i am?
you don't?
move!
oh.
no. cut this runaround, doctor. i know better.
there's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked.  and i think it explains everything.  you see, my father was a sexogenarian.
don't be clever with me, henryk. i've come here as a friend. they're bringing jews in from all over the country. soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. we need more jewish police...
beta cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
yeah, morgan freeman. but he's a colored guy.
what if i told frank that you opened me?
are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox. i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. my wife is from boston. lillian ziegler?
dammit shelly!  why do you always have to be such an asshole!
tick-tock...
kevin.  how's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
don't. think bailey.
yes.
good.  i was just testing ya.  but just you saying that? makes me love ya.
i won't.
brad!
you got elvis?!
c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. c'mon, now.
why?
no i probably wouldn't.
it can be.
when i say 'no,' run for the door.
oh, i used to be such a catholic.
awwww...
what did you think?
don't think about it too long.  you had enough?
any clue as to what it is?
i thought i might come back. in the new year. under my own steam.
i guess -- about my future.
and that's what i'm trying to tell you.  what women are looking over, okay? pecs and a cute butt.
that is a load of shit. personal power has nothing to do with any of this. tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...well that's just more than the man deserves.
you know, i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
yeah, i know what your saying. and i'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
what disadvantage?
there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes.  a dozen liners leaving the harbor. get on one of them.  go to singapore, scotland, manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
she's going to show me her stamp collection.
charming.
have you ever had one do this?
we're old friends, chickie - quit it!  a big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  what did you think would happen in his house?
it's cool departing this way... warm... music...
i'm sorry.  i shouldn't have said...
and, where did you see my portrait?
i already stole it.  last week or whenever it was, in west palm.  i can't be stealing it again, can i?
then what?
what'd you see?
when did you get in?
why do you want to do that?
i'm a bad person.
i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay?
if you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
boy, you must've been up early.
i didn't think you would! it seems to me, karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
never turn your radio off! i thought i was gonna find you scalped! damn it!
let's go now.
oh?
you timed that beautifully.
four in milwaukee.
no. i'm airsick you asshole! where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
don't give me that crap. that's my crap.
we had no children.
god, how can you stand all these assholes?
i asked you what you think of rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
jeff -- isn't it time you came home? you could pick your assignment.
jeff, would you go in with her?
really?  great.  still "remaining men together?"
not me.
why did you do that?
less neurotic.  are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
don't touch me.  he's got... got into my head.
that sword has served me through many an evil time, ben harper.
son of a bitch!
hi.
did you tell walter?
that's strange. i'm nervous. donny's nervous. everyone's nervous. but not you...
what is it with red?  i've never seen him this way.
i hope the man knows what he's doing....
you'd like that?
no.
put it back in park, blade.
but why tell us?
on the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
well, herr inspector! how did you find the camp? crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
i have not said all. by malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar's plan. he hears only that juliet is dead. and thus he goes to the apothecary.
ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
are you sure? maybe...
for god's sake, leave him alone, dad.
commander, sir, we have a big problem. you see, the veil nebula bomb, bomb number 20, is stuck. it won't drop from the bomb bay. it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
-- okay, so you don't like me. you don't like everything i've done. what, because i wasn't such a genius the way i raised you? jesus christ, dad was gone, what was i supposed to do? you tell me, what the fuck was i supposed to do?!
outside.
what?
remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
teasing you is completely unfair.
did she ask about me?
what's your name?
oh.
i am a tradesman, madame, not a doorman. and don't forget these.
exactly. 'cept this gillette guy. he gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. meanwhile, the king sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door.
ohhh i've never been there. 
what are you talking about?
like an agent with one client.
dr. woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  he says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
serious, huh?
don't.  i don't like that. what do you want?
manray was under our nose the whole time.
where are we?
how can you say that, sailor?
makin' trouble for someone?
ben.
it's not a hundred miles.  it's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  pure desert, mountains, a river.  if the map is even real.
where did you meet my father?
i can't make out that shit.
i want you to kill for me.
calm down. tell me what's wrong.
--without  the means  for higher education, so mr. lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
it doesn't matter.  he wins.
i was just thinking that i could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  i'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  i mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
peter?
what?
do i want anyone else?  no.  do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  i'm trying.
is that in my chart?
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. he must have been a very powerful man. although i really don't see that it is any of your concern, miss price.
...cut off !
what?
and you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
it is said that to those who possess the power... all things are possible.
what is...  ...coke?
gabriela ...?
i know i got you into this, hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
you guys'll be using teddy's old space, is that okay?
--i saw what i saw.
i'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
got a match?
no, i absolutely understand. of course.
that's because he knew.  he'd seen these files and knew.
ernie cole here just got himself elected mayor.  lost both his boys in the war.  kenny at anzio and willie at normandy.
damnit...
then you know why i have to face him.
a bully? moi?
you must have drunk too much.
film making can be pretty expensive...
so what?
looks good. how much did it cost?
yes -- those of mr. marsh and a thumb print of miss lawson's.
looks like quite a way to go...
i don't know, honey. different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. some believe in heaven or hell. some think we're born again as little children--
i won't make any noise.
penguin? oh, cal! he is them.
who is this?  what's your operating...
this is where the fun begins, saavik!
what does he know?
well, i know this is really short notice, but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art & design and she tells me that i'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, i hope you don't mind, enid, but i took the liberty of submitting your name.
nothing like a little liveliness.
what are we going to do?
hello?
...education, were you?
way too late. buzz fazeli is history.  too late for what?
sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... i served with your old man.
it must have stopped moving.  i'm not getting anything.
yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
i know, that's usually the only time i actually have a shot.  and what if i wanted to see her again?  i'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
no, he's more of a dinosaur. guy's not a dummy, though. he's juggling alot of balls on this one.
oh. yeah.  it was all worked out before, you know. she and dad had taken care of it.
that's right. and guess who's the new king of the unemployment line.
why are you doing this mr. fletch?
there's this thing out there.  this paternity suit.
like you, i found him not at home!
your father dropped off an extra check.
not a lot of difference.
oh, yeah. that's maya.
wonder how the war's going?
they had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
we just missed the turnoff to the party.
i need to get your signature on some papers here, kit.
you know. the stuff i left.
she trusts me.  she'll do what i say.
you've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
would you like a drink now?
you're a fine judge of character, charles.  it'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  but if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
so what made you change your mind about sidney?
don't calm down.
i couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
when all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
pearl and john.
luck, jim.  don't forget.
i don't understand... the holy oil of clovis... it was quite full the last time i saw it...
don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
the killer.
been busy, have you.
who did?
fuck you.  i'm running this shit.  you talk to me.
okay.
i'd be really ungrateful, if i didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when i didn't know where to turn.
you like bach?
i hate these southern shites.
wait, are you saying that i don't appreciate?
you weren't really interested in suez at all.  incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
is that what i did to you?  is that what happened?  did i just not see you?
jacqueline. mr. romari phoned me. she went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
let's try to be practical about this. the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. i'll remain here... because... well, i don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. anyway, i just don't feel like leaving.
heartwarming. really, i feel weepy.
find your bowler?
no ... thanks though... i'll take a cigarette if you have one.
you don't forget anything, do you?
likewise. and draw two for chasers.  now you're beginning to live.
suzette will be back here any minute.
what could somebody get for them?
my soul was in danger i'd fallen from grace
sheriff hogan --
mitch? why are they doing this?  the birds.
doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
my office.
you don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
i thought... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
a trumpet?
stop!  get back!!  she has the weirding way.  why didn't you tell us!  great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  as a leader of my people i give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  your water shall mingle with our water.
yeah, to play fats again.
you lied.
how do you mean?
well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
not yet...how much further is it?
no, bik, it's a code word for tutsis.
as a new member of our order, i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
i don't know. something.
guess that'd be me. again.
reno, how's about you take new jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
yeah, but still...
it would help me if i could kiss you.
they shouldn't have been here.
get that, will you?
yeah, hey. chad.
don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
you with the cops?
zaltar, please help me.
my name is calloway.
the emperor has decided to marry your archduchess, marie-louise.
what would you do...?
you're lying, aren't you?
yes, mr. dowd.
we are not birds of a feather.
it's cici! cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
oh come <u>on</u>. lots of people drink perrier. it's come a long way.
look out, you --
facing north... i'd hate to commit myself without my compass... pardon me... are you an explorer?
that's my daughter.  or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  she's a drug addict.
sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. you can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
what happened to your hair ?
but you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  i promised we'd take judy to f.a.o. schwarz.
i don't have a pre-nup
a fulcrum release lever!
yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
i suppose you want a tip?
you don't need a drink.
i better not come in.
yeah - where were you?
here you go, baby.
funny, i don't get that feeling. maybe it's because you found out i'm bill parrish's daughter.
well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
don maranzano. welcome.
what do you think?  dick likes it.
claire?
how good's your intelligence?
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
thomas? who's thomas?
good hunting. hayes out.
she won't go to st. cloud's!
i'm going to tell you why. because when i tell someone i'm going to do something, i deliver.
and fifth, you're dating her.
if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.
ow!  no, it's okay.  it's better tight.
it's ok, it's alright. i'll come right back, i'll just go pay for my car.
twenty. i'll be twenty-one next week.
kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
so i've heard.
yes, sir.
do you remember where it is?
i told you to shut up.
we got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
what did he find?
i'm afraid not, mrs. mulwray. these men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. i can't do everything myself.
what's wrong?
i'm scared, mama.
yeah— us golden warriors.  you're a good kid, jimmy, a good tough kid. we stick together, huh, kid?
what am i doing here????? what am i doing here?
an anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
i ate a guy last night.
so, how many people live here now?
what rumour?
how you doing buddy?
what, switch what?
what?
sure...get in!
i'm afraid that's impossible.
i mean, d- he can give you- do you hafta give it so loud? i mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? and- and the funny part of it is, m- marshall mcluhan, you don't know anything about marshall mcluhan's... work!
what?
what was i wearing?
who are you?
oh right. the mustache coffee cup. the one that was sitting on the dash.
you're a vision, louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
did you get help?
i was called and i came.  what's up?
did they try and fail?
i am.
jack crawford is helping your career, isn't he? apparently he likes you. and you like him, too.
god, you sound like jon.  -- turn around.
hey.
says he wanted food.  liar.  he wanted the gold.
i'm sorry danny, but i'll have to give you the full tour later on.
wrong.
i was in luh-love with her.
yeah; it was great money... i could make a dollar a day, sometimes. but only in summer. when it got cold, i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing.
when did you get back?
when we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
you sure are a good cook, selena. man, that looks too pretty to eat.
willow!
and i'm making mine.
when we gonna double back?
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland?
all right ... i got some hungry people in there ... i want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
no? well --  johnson, you're under arrest.  you, too, burns.
yeah.
fuck me!  yes!
we don't have the manpower.
...how can you compare them? tarantino totally bites everything from scorsese...
because she was anemic.  it's right there on her chart. her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
hi.
thank you, mom! thanks, dad!
the planet vulcan. in hailing distance, sir.
please don't.
then you have everything.  you can put them away.
you never talked to me like that - in all these years.
then wait, sonny.  talk to pop.
it ain't the law!
but i'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. i'll bet you're lonesome.
you're going to go see her.
how is lillian? i haven't seen her.
there was a man, poet--a theatre poet, i heard--does he come to the house?
goodbye, mr. fielding.
sorry.
you're the best one in your row.
he seems very nice. is harold interested in, eh, what's going on? i think it's such a super thing to study. and then, of course, i can always fall back on home ec.
debbie, think back! i'm martin... remember? remember how i used to let you ride my horse? tell you stories? don't you remember me, debbie?
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
you told me.
just between you and me, marlon, i'm going away for a while.
did he put you up to it? did he ask you to sleep with me?
and cigarettes.  i smoke, too.
jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
the boston pops.  season tickets.
all right now: get mad at them eggs. eat it there boy! bite it! gnaw on it!
look how full of yourself you are.
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i'm up?... when was the last time you wore pink? when was the last time you drank soup standing up? final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
i know. he called again last night at tatum's house.
you hate your father.
now, if you took the ropes off, i'd be able to feed myself.
what are you trying to say?
hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. get a car of your own.
i lost sight of everything.  forgot who my friends were.
welcome to mobile h.q. weather's turning quite nasty. sir august was blown to smithereens. along with half of banffshire.  the ministry's worried.
put it on the bed. that's the way it's done, isn't it?
there is no devil. there is no god. there is only... nothing.
great game. red sox are winning.
i really hate to bother him, but...
not at all. i've come to pay you a personal and official--and i might say--a *tardy* tribute, mr. smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
we've got work to do.
doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
i'm sorry we haven't met sooner, mr. gardiner. i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. i'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president.  ... tell me, mr. gardiner, just how serious is benjamin's illness? i did not want to upset mrs. rand by discussing it in detail.
i'm not saying it's your fault.
i thought so. anyway, i hope you don't think i'm being meddlesome. i just think you should be careful with this guy.
they could clean around the arrangement.
is it news to you?
lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
not yet, but the governor of chamdo, ngabo jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking.
how's that?
oh, i realized right away. he's really a very nice fellow, hildy -- i found that out.
i am one, dad!
dylan?  he's holding well.  earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
oh.
watch it, shithead!
i wanted to apologize. i can't live without you.
yeah!  don't forget "mercury theatre"... and then every saturday, i'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  i even started ushering there.
you have materials for the side bearings?
why weren't you honest with me? why did you keep your marriage a secret?
i heard cy coates was brought in. he looked pretty bad.
oh...it's not working right. you're home early.  did i scare you?
that wouldn't be too good, would it?
okay! okay! keep your shirt on, young feller. 
oh, leon, you are so good to me. 
now, let's get back to business. i want to get maxie dean and sarah up here immediately.  i can make history here!  i'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
mr. crabbin.
okay, sammy.
good luck, spud.
there's little chicks!  you want to see?
then why didn't you call the police? why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  i'll tell you why--you crook, you.
...yeah.....
i fucking hate raoul.  shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
fine, louis.  we'll stop in for a drink.
this is a war, wade.  you against him.  vengeance time.  the city's just in the way.  kill the fucker. you and me.  we'll work things out when the time is right.
c'mon, man...
guess.
deep and slow, big guy.  deep and slow.  just breathe easy.
where is he?
sit down, elaine.  if this bomb trick works we just might make it.  simon was a fool to eject now.
ha. did he say why?
it's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
what for?
daddy's gone where rudolf went and isn't coming back!
you know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and i was thinking back a year or two ago when ben called me and said he wanted to publish the pentagon papers the next day. the times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and i was frightened but i knew if i said no, i'd lose the whole fifth floor. so we published, and that night, after i'd told ben to go ahead, i woke up in the darkness and i thought, "oh my lord, what am i doing to this newspaper?"  i woke up again last night with that same question.  are we right on this story?
"i am joe's lungs."  it's written in first person.  "without me, joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  there's a whole series -- "i am joe's prostate."
afraid so.
what's wrong with me?
a job??  as a plumber???  you think i come to america to work!
yes?
fuck you.
do you know who i am?
what cop?
what?
jesus christ on the cross, i said i'm listening.
admiral, this is lieutenant saavik.
i'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
i told you that was an accident!
mr....kay?
no.
...he's two floors below you.
do you trust me, julie?
i know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a republican, and she'd do anything for the party.
why? isn't he sleeping here?
fats, let's you and i shoot a game of straight pool.
who said that? gary cooper, james stewart, henry fonda? huh? 
damn.  i hate that!  i hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
i'm tellin' ya, i'm giving you all i know.
i'm going to help her.

we don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
jabez -- you ought to talk to tom about joining the grange.
hey!  what are you trying to do?  get yourself committed?
she's settlin'.
follow me - that way - through my cell -
omigod, i don't be-lieeeeve this! he's gonna like beeeee here!
want to ask him?
do you like putting makeup on people?
remember this...?
what was it this time?
it seems she neglected to mention it
good going. i knew you could do it.
hi.  donna irving?
evelyn. great ass. goes out with that loser patrick bateman. what a dork.
gotta go.
talk english doc.
who is it -- ?
how?
you want some?
no, you dumb son of a bitch. i'm serious. i'm disappearing.
oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
sidney winch.
we can't.  the storm.  the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  and we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
you sure? i thought the rag had to touch?
stupid woman... and that's all?
jon, this is goddam insane. you can't go through with it.  what about eve?
yes. where are the rest of the passengers?
you.
this kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
then you found the leopard --
let's open it.
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
hello, doc.
i'm so hungry.
who's in charge here?
if you're going to be indiscreet, i wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. rich men, like winton, love you and leave you.
why?
tell that one, hollis--
personally james, i'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages.  twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  your readership will be first and second year american collage students...
he works the boats as a "come-on" man. we ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
what's your name!
well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
do we know it's him using the beacon?  not a decoy?
i'm sorry...  ... and what about louise? you mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
yeah.
anyway, i parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- i mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where i finally shot myself?
the worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that bill is right in front of me. only i can't see him...  lecter said, everything i need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
get out!
do you have something to say?
i'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council. and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard. he's composing his first opera.
you remember that story?
well.  that was brilliant.
is that why you killed lee lother?
what about the monitor...?  you getting anything on the shark?
i'm gonna have a corned beef.
yes, sir. i suppose you might call it that, sir.
that’s right. imagine facing it alone.
you see, it is completely out of the question.
what?  hey, listen, what-what do you think? do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in southampton tonight?
how lucky we are.
care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
i can... feel it moving around inside me. you've got to kill me.
quitting time.  grab a cold one?
i'm waiting for him here. the baron and i have been together all day. a hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- it was marvelous --
you're charming the boy.
i'm a police officer. i'm going to have to talk to the boy. what's his name?
yeah? what do you do now?
no, they will not. i know how things work in this city.
oh, yeah. they'll never catch the guy.
i don't know what you're talking about -- get fucked --
what's the point of this?
i think you better put that away.
get him on the phone.
i'm a pine-sol man, myself.
so, you just get here?
maybe it's the wrong ship.
you just did, for christ sake.
you have id?
i think that thing is ben.
what is it?
yes.
against...who could be aggressor....help me out here...units of 303, the defense department confirms, early this morning, albanian time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy william schumann, suffering no casualties.  his condition is reported as guarded, and his route to the us has not been disclosed, but a high white house source confirms he is expected in washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  moss's working on big bird's inaugural.  nine a.m...?  nine?  miss the commuters, but...
in there.  charlie penny owns the place. we knew no one would ever find it.  i'm not even sure i can find it again.
what kind of symbol?
that's what we're doing here. national interest. national security. only this time it's not gold. it's uranium.
is she all right?
i propose we consider a hostile take over. perhaps ol' bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
breakfast.
committed?
huh?
we don't need an act two.
my next delivery is up that way, so i'll be getting down to it real soon.
i spent three years with him. i just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. george was adorable but it drove me crackers. now at least i'm comfortable. lester does what he says he'll do. maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. are you?
now i want you to do something for me.
you what?
it's addressed to no one and no signature.  "to leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
you must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
you punishing him, ain't you?
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and i ask myself, "what happened to me in madison county?" i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. but then i look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you. it's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
of course i saw it.
then suppose you give me the money. four hundred and fifty dollars.
you don't know that.  even i cannot see their fate.
you're not crippled. get in there and make somethin'.
who?
you would, wouldn't you?  i'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
angela?
his family's lived for almost a hundred years. richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. and the kids...
bobbyyyy!  tequila por favor! double shots.  make it tres generaciones, huh.  nothin' but the best for my good friend lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  hey, nice tie.
that'll never work.  they'll just think you're crazy.
nash.
we won't be able to get out of there.
what is she saying?
maybe that's because i'm not randy.
acetylene? mig? tig?
a man would be more considerate. he wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
what was that all about?
useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. i told her, i'm sorry, but theses things happen. let's put it behind us.
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown.  we don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
do you want to go around by the old road?
don't be so optomistic, harry.
something's wrong.
he complained of not feeling well. i thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
it's trash now, like mine.
simon, next door, the charingas' boy.
that'd be nice.
we're locked on mig one. why doesn't he disengage?
you invited me.
what do you want?
well if they can kill the president, they can certainly get me.
you tried to run away.
the fountain is the caspian sea and the sea is serving up caviar.  the 'b's for beluga, the 'p' for petrossian.  of course, they also stand for 'bill' and for 'parrish'.
ben, come in.
different worlds, jack.
he was a great boy for that. what else?
do you like this, salieri?
it's crazy.
yeah.
how do you know about eugene?
should i run him through?
i knew it! i knew this was gonna happen! i had a bad feeling since last night. remember? we are so totally fucked!
gee whiz, boss, you know mr. norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
how are you, jim?
what does he say to do?
john?
you're in terrible trouble, nikko.
yah.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. i want to know what it is.
yes, sir.  won't find a better cqc on the market.
yes.
wait a minute....
i didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
says me.
north island, please repeat? over.
uh...home...
his dick was in his mouth?
if i'd gone public with this yesterday annette michaels might be alive today.
don't you gamble?
okay.
yes! this time we got it right!
thank you.
don't get sore, joe. this is something you got to do for me. i need a thousand dollars—and i need it quick. i'm in a jam.
who the fuck's pig?
hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
he'd assume we had.
it wouldn't hurt to put it in.
you'd better kill me now, diego, because you're a dead man.
take good care of it.
krinkle, this is it. we got it, man. and it's all ours. i mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. you shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, i'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
oh, nothing. i just blew over - i wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
and you. why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? did you miss us that much?
he's very pale. covered with scars.
you have no idea what i'm talking about.
i don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. i just got to have certain information. what's your name?
it’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
when it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him.  i'll give him an earful!
what?
shall i begin by executing the president's daughter? she's right here.
do you wanna sit down?
on a ride.
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
as you see.
yeah, that's what i'm trying to tell you. that chick erica?
-- i was just trying to finish some work!
look, elvis, he is hauntin' me. he doesn't deserve to live. and i do want to kill him. but i don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
i figure we'll get along just fine.
fuck you.
here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
what?
how'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
i've got plans!
i called your agent.  i called the screen writers guild.  finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number.  there was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  you were not there.  you were not to be spoken to.  they never heard of you.
what's that?
i've been buying you stuff all week. i've been buying him stuff all week.
what's that noise?
you're not one of them. there's been a mistake.
remember that shoe you lost...
you think he's bluffing?
i'm fine.
i'm fine. i have to get going to my friends' house.  was it --
will it be possible to have my dog, bijou, sent here?  i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much.
he's gotta be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.
hello.  heard about that graduation present.  really quite a car. look, i know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  i'll tell you a couple of things about myself, i'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now i'm back.  i'm an athlete, so i rarely drink.  kickboxing.  you heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  don 'the dragon' wilson, lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  i can see by your face, no.  my point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
michael...
is it true you're going to interview dr. furtwängler today?
time's up.  thank you for the interview.
whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
no, no, you did fine.  i'd even say well done.  besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
i don’t know.
what can he do, he's clean...
no. it's a lot further than that.
toto's my dog.
unlock these cuffs.
get back to the horses. they're straggling.
no -- i guess not.
didn't see 'im, mama. the other men there say they didn't know daddy.
i figured you more as a socialist?
how do you get this thing down?
yes sir.
--maybe i don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
administration, ensign blondell.
quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. come on down, let's chat..
you seen my suitcase?
hi, baby.  i've missed you.
well...i don't mind.  i can put up with it.  i'm taking six months off after this, and i won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
a $500 tip! for the housekeeper!
yeah, i read the report...
at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
oh....say something.

let me go! let me go!!
pacqualinincheewa root.
i don't know.  they said we have three days.  they said we have three days.
are you all set?
the fare is eighteen credits, please.
what do you do in the joint besides pimp?
we're okay.
my van is half full.
we did it!  we actually sang a chord!
dude, if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it, i'd give it my best shot. i'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. but this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
if you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
you're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  and it's drawn to you.  you don't like that.
i gotta, i gotta go...!
excuse me, skipper---
suleiman!
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud."
...well, i'm not sure where i --
are you wigging out?
ho -- ho --ho -- ho
what is what?
*no*!
what do we do with him?
is she dying?
in maybe three or four issues.
shields, mr. chekov.
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy.
we still don't know.
poor bastard never knew what hit him. jesus, i almost felt sorry for the guy.
what are you doing here?
leave me alone!
by the way davis, how is cynthia? you're still seeing her, right?
what do you want me to do?
for not believing you.
i feel -- fidgety, ma -- not right at all.

and don't come back.
well, now kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. maybe...
yeah. give ya a boner.
yes.
no, you don't understand.  i <i>can't</i>.
it is a story, you decide.
no?
i have no illusions about the future. what is, is. we make choices. and we become the sum total of our choices. i can live with that.
you ready to keep winning?
bobby, this is a plumb gig. it's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. it's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
i'm trying to help.
cool.  i could actually use a couple of allen wrenches.  what do you need?
listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
look i-i-i'll be okay.  i'll be okay.
you don't have to.  the rabbit's wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink & paint club.  you can catch her in action there.
"tortious interference"? sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
were you a drug addict?
what?
at the airport?  cause we decided at the airport he hugs the fat, wet albanian broad, we...
helen's going to be pissed.
what are you doing?
no shit, holmes.  you're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
no.  it didn't.
now, why in the world would he do that?
what are you-
steven buggin' you?
i'm paying you to give cello lessons. not to pervert my child.
was that all?
eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
no, he got hit by a bus.
i guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
that wasn't her toe.
it's just to the corner, mam. in broad daytime. nothing can happen. i'll be there to protect you.
seven thirty-five .. here, "town gets top cop." i was gonna pin it to your wall.
no one. no one at all. i'm unemployed. who do you?
i see. and you are in california for what reason?
it is called: mantan - the new millennium minstrel show.
merle --
have you no natural resources of your own? have they even robbed you of that?
it's still making the noises. it's broken.
let me guess. we're going on a "long trip".
no, i'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
zit cream?
martin, it's not funny!
glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. it's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
what the hell you thinking, girl? strolling in here this late?
he comes in here every day and we bullshit. he's used my toilet a thousand times. if i told him no, he'd know something was up.
why'd you do that?
--but i think the thought has crossed your mind.
dad?  about last night?
yes.
mrs. hinkle... do you drink?
you're chuck noland.
was that okay? i mean, was i able to... satisfy you?
i've worked with it.  i've seen cures. it is at least a hope.
i can't see anything.
raoul, no... you cannot do this.  no matter how your heart is broken --
you've taken some strange journeys in your life.
look, asshole, i don't got time for this.  if you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
forget his reputation.  do you think we've got a plan or not?
colonel vitelli.  we got a busted-in cold vault inside.
well...i-i think we should wait till things settle.
i bet you're a damn good poker player.
you might see her. she writes your daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? i wish you'd tell her something... i never could write letters.
it was kind of funny.
i don't know.  that's the point.
what choice!!?
hey!  weigh!  blow the man down...
churchill, degaulle, disraeli.  they all went through the pain of losing power.
easy, bill.
well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
what responsibility?
he said that my hand felt good.
jesus... go ahead.
he must not realize he is.  like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then.  he must've manifested his dream.
at least our obituaries will be accurate.  that's reassuring.
well, you know, it's tough. a lot of traveling. a lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas...
what are they for?
he will.  but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  you've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  and farley's given you that chance.  you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead.
one week at the most!?
get out.
gone fishing.
what's the matter with you?
you haven't heard of it.
alright.  we're going up.
rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay god.
ace, listen to me.
gave all that up.  going into business.
you're, you've, i mean, how have you bee--
you were a soldier?
you know damn well who it is.
bullshit politics.
no.
no.
you're fucked, sami. you know it.   that's why you're here.
you're always in the middle of a match.
you don't understand!  the octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
tell me again.  i want to hear you say it again.
who's going to slow me down? you, you fat pig.
the pied piper of hamelin. by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty...
i'm missing two!
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  no matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
if you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  stick out your tongue.  that'a boy. now why don't you just lie down and relax.
of course i'm sweating.  i'm burning up.  it's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
yeah, winesburg, ohio, was never like that... but i got something that just might cheer you up.
fine.
shut up.
yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
i'm her sister.
xxxxxx.
ellie -- are you okay?
man don't know if he's been to mars or not
wouldn't they normally be locked?
no, i mean --
this is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
why did you do that?

there's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
in the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. way i see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
look at your hand.
who is the boss?
all right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  so carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  and <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
you were in the war?
what cheap shit... hey, waiter!
if it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
he didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
i'm sorry.
i'm thinking ... i wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten. ever.  but ...

oona?  do you suppose it's a faerie?
well, the night is young. did you straighten out the chair situation?
what did you just say?
it's the sauna, i keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
each day is a little life.
so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams.

albatross?  doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
this is our oil from our estates?
say it anyway.  come on, how much do you love me?
susie, i'm sorry if---
no...
i don't know if you'd call us "friends"...

won't you unzip my dress?
where are your parents?  you have to try...
but in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. no?
it was?  i didn't...know.
an hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
i got it.
well, i dunno.  i mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
who was that on the phone?
well, officer -- do your duty.
louis gara's dead. l.a.p.d. found him dead in a car on ninth. and we've lost ordell.

they're probably on to the next buffet by now. there's a retirement home up the road. they'd be easy.
perfect for a child.
the owl is a messenger. when one shows itself to a sioux... it means someone's gonna die. the owl told him about leo.
indy?

the daughter of his enemy.
how long have you been standing there?
but the nearest shelter's the wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
sure.
it's december 25th, 1993 today.
these guys have gotta be the quill, duky.  we can't afford to rank the joint.
when we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. the mountains have the highest concentrations. once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...

i don't want to go to jail for this.
new star.  hey, guess what? i got a new star on the readout.
you were his friend... you must have been, if he had given you this...  if he sent you to his home. he was the best this country had -- he was --
you said that boyd.
tod was.  he was with ratan.
i called peltzer on my way over here, marty! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. that's a fancy way of saying eyewash. he's got a corneal inflammation.
no shit.
i will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
it hurts that you would say that to me.
i'll get the girl.
anne, come here. listen—
mookie, get offa da phone.
getting food.  we were out of food. what's wrong?  you sound mad.
you invest in shows?
you don't listen very good.  this break in -- i can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  or i could see it gets forgotten.
all right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  is he as good as you say?
what?
proms always make me sad. they're so final. graduation. everyone's scattering, moving on.

wait.
sure.
free --
yes. you just got to stick with it.
took what?
they're offering... 
what now?
you remember that much?
i'm sorry. that's the wrong answer.
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
be careful.
it's like a song.
i don't think it would fit you.
what about the mainframe's access code?
i mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
um, just about everyone.
what drill?
you know you're welcome any time!
i knew. i sensed it when i heard your voice.
armed robber.
i have a question for you, mr. stephens.
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
tell me mr. massey. what was your performance about this afternoon?
kevin?  do you not love me?
you beast, you monster, what have you done with brad?
some kids found her necklace near tipper creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
you okay?
who is this?
why not?
how? by taking my money?
this is completely improper, commander chekov. i have no intention of allowing reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. which is seldom.
could be ten or fifteen.  maybe even twenty.
no, don't worry, i moved on.  i was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "bride of the monster."
i said, <u>i'll take you there</u>. nobody's going near star without me.
mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
thank you, mr. lawson.
the questions little bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
samhain.

how?
hello, spooky.
i'll find a way to contact the enterprise. you're going to be all right.
a year and a half later? you're still brooding?
jane, i'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
wow.
if you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
i'm goin'. you on the list?
well, think about it.  isn't it possible?
oh, yes, the bonus.
right, right...
well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  what's so wrong with kids?
what'd you do, piss your pants?
right.
you go to hell.
you're very kind.  i'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
i'm a push-over for whom?  what is it? who's on the phone?
my name's leonard.							 *
we're waiting for the jet car.  billy's bringing it.
no, i'm questioning your hearing! you hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." i hear... "potential brown & williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse." i hear... "shut the segment down. cut wigand loose. obey orders. and fuck off...!" that's what i hear.
what do you make with that?
it's hard to describe. i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
did they tell?  it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  according to the elders, an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
oh, i'll "get it." i'll "get it" all right. i might even take seconds.
were you adopted, bob?
it tastes bad.
she may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. i've seen your college record. i've never heard of most of those schools. tell me something, mayo. did you buy that degree?
no!
are you kidding?  you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
what happened?  what happened?
but, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to genesis...
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we'll bury him in the morning.
try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the pottery hill. and a better jack. we planned badly.
it doesn't belong to you, mrs. lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
snotty neurotic bitch...
then answer this: if ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
yeah, i do. especially from that angle.
i guess you've seen some bad things.
nuwanda?  please?
a little ol' boy.
i thought you'd like a ride to work.  you don't own a cat, do you?
what's mine is mine.
think back about what she said. exactly what she said.
why are we landing?
glenn michaels.
he ask, i give him anything.
found no skeletons?
sorry about that, mrs. heine. shall i repeat the ques...
i just hold it loosely with both hands?
evenin'...evenin' reverend...or do i call you 'captain'...?
not, "eternity forever"?  the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  i'd kill for that part.
he's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
all right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
i killed grady.  i killed grady, lisa. i killed schneider.  oh my god, he's inside me...
yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
come on, sheriff. we've got to get bail.
i didn't mean it to sound like that.
i'm going to the show.
oh, you still want it? even though uhh...
that's because we didn't have a wedding. your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. she was engaged to somebody else.
we're all set,  sir.
doyle oil?  a massey pre-nup?  she loves him.
but how? where do you place paul that night?
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? i don't think so.
c.o. is colonel blake. lieutenant colonel henry braymore blake. one of them regular army clowns. push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
he's shut out the communication circuit!
but i don't know, sol. i never heard of sol. i'd just get in trouble. that's why we shouldn't go see about diane selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
that's good. now what's her name?
don't get upset. i lied too. i don't make no five hundred dollars a week. everything i make goes to granville.
not a minute!
i left the gate open and otis got out! he could get hit by a car!
samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
all that i'm saying...
sure. we'll go next weekend and --
i don't know, grady. i just dropped him on a corner.
no. have you ever felt discriminated against, at wyant wheeler?
i'm okay here. why bother?
what?
you are.
it's fine.
hold it, hold it...
don?
my pleasure, sir.
no need for braces, donnie.
you can forget about sparring, kid.
you really don't want me to play huh?
yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
it isn't any better.
sweetheart, write down your former address.
i checked the bag at the airport, when i came.
i'll be back as soon as i've got her far away and safe. we'll hunt this fiend down together.
you driving this car?
the man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. he lost control and is capable of doing it again.
you know i am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
i wish you'd told me.
i'm telling you i don't care what time you think you're in. you're not william starks. [beat] i don't believe in many things, but i believe in death. and it doesn't give back what it takes. so whoever you are...i did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
how does winston find him if a.t.f. and all the local police can't?
you just can't bear the idea of good news.
it's the influence of all those family films.  right, mom?  hey, mom??... 
agent hadley.
well, i made it. this here is ratso rizzo and i...
yes, sir.
here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in havana.
that wasn't so hard.
not dead?  in a cemetery?
quite sure. i find it just a bit too - too "seventeenish" for me...
buzz gundersen.
i see... a fox
this is noble, sir.  his wife is crippled. his children are on the brink of starvation.
i am a patriot. i love my country. can you understand that?
old?
so whatja do now?
you know i need to verify this.
okay, i guess. it's so intimidating. you know being away from home, not knowing anyone. i feel like such a geek sometimes. everyone's so cool and i'm so not.
there' no reason for name calling.
a sauciere --
yes?
see you next weekend?
what the hell was that?
can i ask you a question? why did you come here today? if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?
gate three. it's boarding now.
i'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
amazing. i hate to say it, but it is.
thank god for diane.  she was my best friend, my source of love and strength. oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  after nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  and the secret? good communication.
how's sleeping beauty?
uh... i can assure you, mister daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
medication? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
lemme guess where you got that from. tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
just concentrate on the task at hand please. listen to me. you should be giving me this lecture.
buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if i kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should i put this? they'd be officially discouraged.
you saying freddy's this ancient thing?
we did not approach you.
what?!
'cause if it was me, i could just catch a greyhound back.
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. if leon’s austrian was looking for you i reckon he’d have found you before i did.
like you.
did she make any sound?  didn't scream?
we'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
you open?
i've got a lock on the signal pattern. we can filter it out.
all of the sudden, i'm feeling kind of nervous.  god, i hate blind dates.  why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in america?
looks like that cat paid off in spades.
no, i tell you! nobody knows where he got it.
is it because i'm becoming too popular?
who the hell knows?  he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
which is?
what can i say!
i got some.
oh no, mrs. robinson. i think -- i think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. i just don't think we could possibly --
but...
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
...how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
mademoiselle sultenfuss and the amazing dr. j! how's the summer treating you?
i want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion.
and then you'll leave her out of it?
data... are you sure you're all right?
nigel, get lost.
no, i gotta admit this is peculiar.  did you have a light burning or something.
what're you, crazy??
yes, sir.
quite an achievement...
what's the plan?
what do you mean? you're rita.
never been here before?
i'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
well, you're the only one.
mr. carter, i appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason i am here.
that does it, swana.  now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
you want to watch some television?
three patrol ships are heading our way.
that's what gives me the fear.
order chinese for us and meet me the library?  anything but beef.
what about those men we met this morning?
and the carrying charges?
slowed things down?  where have i been?  have we been going fast!?
yes, sir.
i've seen that before. never had anyone actually do it.
and keep only forty-percent?  no thanks.
that's the last of it.
i'm sorry i asked.
clothes.
report.
dr. kurtzweil is in the trunk.
lotte? is that you?
whatever.
back at the door -- i asked you to back away.
well, yes, he'll talk. well, no, no. you'll have to teach him to talk.
twisted?
listen to me.  hear the words.
how's it going -- ?
you're lying. i don't believe you.
sounds good...
perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
enough to go to prison? childs' px scam, mueller was in on it --
i mean tomorrow.
all i'm saying is we have to be careful. we can't get caught.
no.  she has gone out.
no -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, mrs. robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
what's your story?
good -- like i said, take your pick.
stay by the window. by the window.
i want to buy a car.
i dove 315 feet!
funny hours.
it was like that scene in the godfather. frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family. and he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his brother. they brought the brother from sicily. and frankie can't say a word. he can't testify. that's what it was like seeing pat in there. i couldn't even have ruth cross examine her.
kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
i beg your pardon?
what 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  we've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, joe?
i've got to get out of here, diego.
it's a lie!
then what are you hiding?
charlie...?
what are you making such a big deal about?  they're only lobsters. look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
you know, general kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of rostopchin's secret police.
can i have the cadillac?
hey man. . .  you don ' t think i can be "cool"?  you don't think i can be "laid back" like everyone else?
you could use a new one yourself.
as long as you realize i'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
might. might not. could say we're of two minds on the subject.
mason.  mason?
plus, you could use that commission.
keep still.
no, sir.
where are you from?
a little.
okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
no.  many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. this is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, m. charnier.
be like a weight off your shoulders.
i don't believe it. they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down? what else do they want you to learn?
-- i give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
david.
charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
i'm in the bath, mom.
how are you, nick?
you need to remember who you're talking to...
take this off.
my dear talleyrand, none of the kings of europe bear any friendship for france.  it is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  the only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones i have won on the battlefield.
i love las vegas, man. oh, i forgot my x-ray glasses.
where're you going?
oh -- i almost forgot.  your head.
you seem sad, spooky.
they asked who it was.
you heard what abbott said?
no, monsieur varlac, my warrant is only for you.  now, will you please come down at once.  you will be taken back to chalon for trial.
could you take her up right now, king?  other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
well?
hugo.
beautiful, wasn't it?
i shall need a small plane.
...no, she didn't...
what did he do? did he do anything that was different?
you know what my number one fantasy used to be?
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
is he some kind of celebrity or something?
i can't believe what you are finding out. are you going to continue with this. are you going back to her apartment?
that was very interesting research george was doing!
what?
that shirt, mr. boone.
use your brain for once. is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? you are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. dead!
he just lost his best client.  he called from the plane.  i invited the guy over.
a man who is not married has nothing.  he is a man of trouble. you need a woman.
i think we're making a lot of noise.
you saying whitefolks won. that what you saying?
never a pair. i have never had a pair.
about what?
and you can't?
if you are face to face with her, dive left.
no. i have spoken to the queen.  her majesty's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
of course i knew.
you want me to pump?
thank god he did.
brazilian. 
well, hello.
a 16th century statue was destroyed. saint dionysius the aeropagite.
the pages are gone. that's real.
oh, me, i'm okay.
we've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
okay, we'll come back to that.  so, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  it's longdale, looking for a snuff film. and you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
we're from scientific american.  we read about your discovery.  we'd like to take a look.
you think i'd be standing here? you set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. can you remember that?
thank you.
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
he speaks about himself in the third person?
no-one should think themselves wiser than me!  it is not for any of the queen's subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning.  it is the queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely!
what?
it is for us to determine whether you are a good christian, not you.
i'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
quick -- hide in here...
fuck you.
that's your idea of logic?  i tell the judge i didn't murder the man - the judge says, "why not you?"
whoever they are, they're getting closer.
i was her best friend.
i talked to the army's bureau of records. you've never even been to viet nam.
i know you as well as i know myself, shinzon. there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
this is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
oh yeah. it's far, it's another world.
what's that?
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
yes.  yes, i have.
your majesty...?
they've got a real hen house here! you can't hear yourself speak.
your resume is impressive. nine years in the army. extensive counter terrorism work. i shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. what's the catch?
well, i'll be - !
carl!  set up the camera.
you know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
don't be giving me attitude, lee.  i've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  we haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  i'm on vacation, and i want some mu-shu.
we'll take it slow. you'll never feel you can't handle it.
what about us? i'm moving away your staying here.
man, that music is hot. what goes on down there, slim?
it's amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
you know how this is gonna go!
don't you want to change?
mr. udall... excuse me. hey there!  have you seen verdell?
take us to vegas. <b> ext. desert road -- day </b> the crew rides in the back of the wanderer's truck toward vegas. <b> int. vegas security lockdown -- night </b> domino stares at taryn as she returns to the table.
lookin' to make the papers, john?
she calls it, 'tourist on the loose.' local government commissioned it. for the public beach....
you can't have them. go to hell.
don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  you don't want to look shifty, do you?
she said she did all the work.
no.
with ten thousand? nine.
worrying - clicking - picking - you may as well be back in los angeles.
did you do anything?
you're a fucking dead man--
oh, there is no hurry. tonight he'll be at rick's. everybody comes to rick's.
he always look so
let me see this.
nice of you to come.
but your friend is waiting downstairs.
you're all safe. thanks be to god!
michael called yesterday.  he wants to take willy for the summer.
sit down and join us, cindy.
i had to, edie. i had to see you.
what world are you talking about? ain't nothing harmless down here.
i stick around and wait for the five hundred.
guess what?  luther just got in line.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
that's the third time he's called today.
for now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. the books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  and, these murders have been like forced attrition.
well i'm sure that's really important, but i don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  do you want to tell him that?
for a price, ugarte, for a price.
i got...
...i know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
captain marion, i understood you to be a patriot.
father!
i wish you everything i couldn't give you, hildy.
maybe eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
electra.
there's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, frank.
let's move.
uh-huh.
that sounds good.
if you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
what's it to you?  i declare it.  here i am, back in the states for less than a month --
why people die?  give it up, d'amour.  go home.
i suppose...you think i should thank you.
you're crazy.
...-natic.
no.  heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and theo needs time on the vault.  after the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  until then...we do not alter the plan.
i want to know everything about you.
how did you know?
i'm going inside.
fine--they're fine.  oh, miss paine, i--i want to apologize-- what the papers said i said about you--that wasn't true. i--i would never say a thing like that.
do you have to do that?
they need to run first and second?
who's a yo-yo...? who do you think's a yo-yo! they're all yo yo's. i mean they're all great guys, for christ's sake, but... the point is, nick, without you i'd hunt alone. seriously. i would. that's what i'd do.
why are you talking like that?
yeah. i think so. it's hard to --
we're going to die.
is he still alive?
well, bright eyes, is our throat feeling better?
sure you don't want your wallet?
the reactor's still hot. we've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. nothing serious.
ugh, these tapes are a mess.  i don't know where to begin...
suppose those contained all the file info too? you could have a third or so of it there.
you told us about the appearance of this... voice.  what exactly did you see?  part of it... or all of it?
matthew, look at him. when i lived in roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. he was bigger than ten movie stars.  where's your white lincoln limo?
demon! demon! that's why you can walk on it! demon!
he wouldn't do that.
hmmm. do you miss me?
it's beautiful. thank you.
jesus christ... the goddamn english will pay for this!
an hour! or less!
mr. stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
if only i didn't feel guilty asking annie to move out. it'd probably wreck her. but i should be honest.
where is it?  where'd it go?
there's a first time for everything, admiral.
oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.
he just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
dream on!
but we can't kill it.  if we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
not yet.  where's mr. ripley?
you were the new and improved you.
do you know where you are, fran?
he's perfect! a baseball player. what could be more american!

you're not saying what i think you're saying.  i can't believe you're even thinking it.
later. listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
what a mess.
but, hell, this is nothing compared to venezuela.  when i was vice president, ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  they threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. read six crises, bob.  boy, pat was brave!
we make love?
is everything ready?
ok.  i love you.
hey! we decide something, that's it! we're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. we've got to think --
you! how can i ever get any fame playing you!
they told me i was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
i'm not sure it's come to that.
get married?
i suppose they are, sir.
yeah.  a long time ago.
yeah, but whose point of view?
but it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
thank you.
why me?
you've worn a stillsuit before?
pepsi?  tequila?

then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
well if there was an article about it i'm sure she did. she was always reading.
really -- you don't think they're overly feminine?
ah, you'll get her back soon enough. that's easy, she likes you.  what you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  you gotta give her what she's never had.
you're a butcher?  what do you use pig intestines for?
yes!
i don't like cake.
you got a name, cop?
you mean this, sir?
"goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  to the killer.  jerry lee lewis.

but if you could, you would?
sorry about your wallet, but if you think i'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out visa and a bad fake i.d., you're fucking crazy.  jake.
whoa. . .
yes, you can. i've got it set up. we'll be fine. all i need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. i've got a guy in here from pittsburgh who'll move it for me. believe me, in a month we'll be fine. we won't need anybody.
hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
it's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. where are they?

nothing, ray.  that larry, he's a pisser.  you did the casitas youth camp with him, didn't you?
how do you do, my dear.
i used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. didn't you do that when you were younger?
yeah.
did you hear what thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
you can't take that... it's personal property...!
yet we hear you are making an opera from it. is this true?
you need some weed?
i'm not sure i do, archie.
the trick is not to think about it. see that one? the widow st. clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. she's perfect for you. go ahead.
mmm, i could tell.
he's all right.

it needs a hat.  there was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
all right. loneliness.  well -- separated. from other people. forgotten.  well, as if i can be here, i can go through the motions, right? but the truth is, i don't belong.
detroit.
he's not a "hot rod".  whatever that is.

how much did you say it was, tom?
if you'll just listen to me for a minute --
what are you talking about?
here i am. i... i want to thank you for what you did. not just for... for pulling me back. but for your discretion.
and do what? read about the next family in the morning paper?  in my monkey ward safehouse 'cause i can't take my family home?  this ends when i make it over.
marty, i don't know how to tell you how much i appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. so my mother comes in...
what's with charlie?
bullshit, yeah.  well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
but what about this "cinderella man"?
if it was left up to me, i would poison him.
why not?
get your hands off my daughter!
we don't have any proof of that.
if you want to know who's been reading paradise lost, purgatory, and say... the life and time of charlie manson, the bureau's computer will tell you.  it might give us a name.

walter--
it's your mistake.
you should have.
i haven't, either. but you *will*. the morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
absolutely.
i'm kidding.  you know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  and you don't know how to quit?
i met you at my father’s funeral.
you going to sit here all day?
i wanted to apologize, susan --
hey, wait take this.
i'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. they didn't let their presence be known until after mr. blonde went off. i'm not sayin' they weren't there, i'm sayin' they were there. but they didn't move in till mr. blonde became a madman. that's how i know we were set up. you can see that, can't you, mr. white?
hello?
what did you say your name was, sweetheart?
shh. come on, it's gonna be ok.
... power ...
okay. here's how it is. what goes into my book, as of noon, is that i apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? where you plan to take a long nap. do i make myself clear?
okay... oh, umm, would you mind if i borrowed some clothes?
he's lance hunt! just take off the glasses -- and it's him!

it was fine.
what should we do? what if he recognizes us?
well, what's the point of waiting?
why?
actually, i...i don't. what does that mean?
you're on a budget from now on.
well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  how long till dawn?
oh, god... no... not molly.
honey. it's doesn't mean anything. it's not a message.
slowly or quickly?
down, oswald.  we have to talk.  you see we've got something in common.
did you hear what i said?  come inside....
even to the hat. same old dreamer, too. one look at you and i can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. clayton smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
walter...walter listen carefully.  i don't want you to make any more statues.  do you understand? no more statues.
hey, man, how's it going?
no you're not!
see? and what does this guy she's with do?
they haven't harmed anyone.
i think so too.
watch my back!
some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
are you listening to me, you ingrate!
god...i think i'm gonna be sick--
no -- not at all.
they lived a long time ago -- before you and i were born.
how would you like to go visit your uncle phil in los angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.

"if i should stay. i would only be in your way. so i'll go. and yet, i know, i'll think of you each step of the way...
harry?  harry?!
have you ever seen animals make love, mr. dulaney?  they have such passion -- such savage emotion.  they struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  not really.
it is to be expected on a sunday.

famous story even. straight burn. just an engine and truck first on scene. what did you feel, brian, when you first got there?
don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  that's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
i -- lost something.
can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  courtland wants to...
okay, so you're a victim.
do you have your own room?
that's fantastic.
i wonder if they've --  i don't want to hear anything about it.
i shall. from your knowledge of mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
you have no interest in making things easy, do you?
what, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, kelly that really made me mad?  don't tell me you're mad.  be mad.  be who you are right now.
fuck off! he never wrote any of them.

ramón -- listen my kids ...
they can't touch us at this height.

what do you know of my pain?
oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. oh no, i won't wear garters—
what the hell's the matter with you, jackson?
maybe you'll catch it.
i hope you like it. it's a marquis cut, 1.5 carats. they had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  letty?
i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life!  nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
first you tell me.
you never called me back.  i left messages.

stu...stu...
turn on the t.v.
three men dead.  one of them a cop. how's that sit in your gut, utah?
i can't make it.  you go on, master luke.  it doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  i'm done for.
there's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>pass</u>," i'll rat them out to you... 
you love him?
i'm sorry... i didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
there. that's right.
oh, it's not so bad. i have two wonderful kids, my own business.  still, knowing what i know now, if i had the chance to do it all over again, i'd sure do things a lot differently.
what i need to <u>say</u>...
poker!
it's just that maranzano's the only bastard i ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the irs. he came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
i just can't find a nest. the root of the problem. i've looked everywhere. what's the russian for ant? sorry that's a stupid... sorry. this is strange isn't it.
well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.

whatever happened to norman rockwell?
there might be another tiny piece we missed. i want to look around before we close up.
slaughterhouse.
did it do you any good?
you know what they make this stuff out of?
tomorrow morning. ten o'clock.
where are you two going?
i'll have to re-energize.
couldn't get on the boat.  i'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  and skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
it's perry!
let's have a look, do you mind?
so no funny stuff.  okay?
that's a bit much.

downstairs.
it has to be at sophie's. she didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
i know. that's why i'm asking.
we are concerned about more than casablanca. we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
they didn't. the guys felt it was the only way i'd get a date. anyway, you're pretty good. you're elite.
hello wade.
you want me to give up? let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
what is your proposal?
you know what i'm talking about. don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
he will be with us. nonetheless.
just wander.
where can we meet?
hmmm... what did we talk about?
it wasn't a joke.
you're not gonna come back, are you?
we've got to keep moving.
no!  no!  she's alive!  we have to --
you might've seen jimmy hoffa dancing with timothy leary.  i don't care.
what?  yeah.
when one sees you they all see you.
it's just as if i've seen a ghost today...
oh, freddie. what could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
you know somethin', daddy?
it's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
oh... nothing. not-no, no!
what would their reaction be?  i hadn't the foggiest.
i say!
...i don't know what i do feel like.
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months.  well, it's been six months, and i was looking forward to seeing my son.
we need the other drop-ship.  the on one the sulaco.  we have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
hungry.
walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he's a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.
how you feeling?
everybody can relax.  i found the car.  how do you like it?
gazzo's gotta come to you.
that's weird --
just listen.  you remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan--
if i find out you're behind this, i'll kill you.
i don't think they can make it stick, bob. i mean, what do they actually have on future man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
really?
i don't know. he moved away.
how much money did you leave up there?
what??
excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
you can't imagine how many men have told me that.
thought you was in jail.
and if i triumph, you triumph.
whose money is this?
almost right.
what the fuck kind of questions are those?
i've never treated you like a whore.
yes.
and the more you tried, the more i wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. and how you suffered... i need your forgiveness, louis.
you remember junie?
why jack?
this letter was addressed to superman care of me.
there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
next time he calls tell mr gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. got that?
they were all wrong. they couldn't control him.
yes sir...
'course you do, jake.
oops! i dropped it!
you don't think i'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
wander separately? ah, but only one is a wanderer. two, together, are always going somewhere.
then something woke you. what? did you dream...? what was it?
guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. i had to let him help with the car.
yes.
you really do believe in destiny?
you just say. i'm not really --
future man.
you fucking crazy?  i need it to burn these things off.
may i use your telephone?
this is a mistake. i shouldn't be here.
i'll say--how fast is this boat going?
not really.
did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
'cause it clogs up your heart.
if magua give women to yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
hey, he's real abstract and different.

who are you looking for now?
now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
barks at the mention of food. licks his lips.
say what?
slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
maybe so.  maybe so.  but that ain't why i came to see you.  you sold the building.
indivisible and inseparable.
what?
now what?
sponsor!!!
the movie.
how is that wally doing?
this huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, lieutenant.  you'll just scare people off.  i can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  it's state of the art.
all right.  whoever she is, i'll admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do.
right.
yeah, but i didn't do anything.
uh-huh.
i still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. you expect your father to come through?
yes.
whatever.
a bad girl, miles. she might need to be spanked.
judas e. priest, who did you borrow that from? adolphe menjou?
i think it's okay, king.  they should go off on impact.
listen to me: they got some of them.
ok.
i thought so.  he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
anything.
excuse me?  could i say something?
what for?
executive clemency ...
i confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
really?
this is the signature of webb.  and i know the temper of our men. rather than spend the war in a french prison hulk in hudson bay, they'd fight to the end.
who's that?
avoid-all-contact-day.
i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up... i saved some people. and now i think death is after me.
oh no, sir. some people are natural putterers. others can never master it.
it's here, ray.  it's looking at me.
i guess so.
not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
okay.  i'll keep digging.
that's hilarious. you sound just like one of those guys.
who was your girl before annette?
out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.

i'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
but it's on the water.
cause i can get a job.  i will.  and you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  would that make you happy?
it's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
you sure about this faa announcement?
do you want me to get it for you?
i did like the music.
are you sure?
i know. you told me. i'm okay with it.
about a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
so you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, vincent.
what did you think of the suspect zero theory?
you said you weren't always impotent.
maxine...
you gotta get that girl out of your head. it's time to move on. you're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. the ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
yeah. asked rev. pike if he could stay in the cellar.
'i hope your dreams come true.'
i can't just walk in and take my clothes off. it's embarrasskin.

yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
it's a miracle, herr mozart!
brave sir robin ran away.
of course. let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- i'll get a job -- or, better still, i could get a place in rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
we're gonna be plumbers, frank.  we're gonna plug a leak.
oh, will! i'm sorry.

ben's still out there --
did i what?
smart girl.
i was with max when he got the call.
when i said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, i meant for us. i know your record with sarber and webb, and i'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. no one walking on your heels. just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. i'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
wait a minute.  now i know where i've heard of you.  you're the gadget guy.
there, mr. webster.  all open and above-board and in due and legal form.
good morning.
you have to call the police...

you really are having a mid-life crisis.
we shall double our efforts.
well yes -- you know that about george.

how you doin', boy?
i don't know.
how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?
i can't believe what i'm seeing.

and but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
please!  and what happens after tomorrow?
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices.  you don't have a choice.

i've never loved anybody!
it's a plastic, yeah.
private investigation, you mean. yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
i'm afraid you are.
i'll call you from detroit, baby.
yeah.
it's already started.
i'm afraid.
well, mr. saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
don't see why i can't ride, too! i'm second in command, damn it!

we'd be in the hole by now. hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
i can't understand it! where is he? i mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
yourself. good, bad, everything. just show me who you are for once.
yeah. they're in the semis.
it's called guess how i'm going to die!
we're only on the fucking list for marie's gig at the pulaski pub, that's all!  all three of us.
no. don't ever want to go out without telling us.
my co-counsel, ron motley, and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  if you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...

well, i believe you when you say you go to school.
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?

hey, jimmy. you got the time?
you married?
gene, you misunderstood!!  you're not getting both of them!  it's physically impossible!
i told everyone seven-fifteen. didn't i? seven-fifteen.
the mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. a physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...

you'd do the newspaper right here.
you know, mr. bean's okay.  you're not gonna kick him out, are you, dad?
i understand black culture.  i grew up around black people all my life. if the truth be told i probably know "niggers" better than you, monsieur delacroix.  please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote n word.  i got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so i feel i have a right to use that word.  i don't give a damn what spike says, tarantino is right.  nigger is just a word.  if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i.
jesus creeping shit!
otherwise you may have to what?
fine... fine.
that's 27, sir.
why me? what about jay?
it's not somebody else.

why did you take jamie?
aaaaaaah...my god...my god...i am heartily sorry...for having offended thee....offended thee...
saunders--if there was *any* way--
what lesson?  not to expose fraud when i see it?  not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  run it the way i said, reilly - "this afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
yes, i would.  that's why i asked.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure.  and kate, thank you for coming.  thank you for being such a good friend.
all right, miss juspeczyk.  pack your things.
you know what really scares me? living too long. losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. and my brains...sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime tv.
why?  i don't know.
no, no, of course not.
holy shit, yes!
leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.

what are you thinking, momma?
what could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
i know, i'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
...don't do it to me...
listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy.  he's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
maybe... i don't know, if you want to talk --
shut up, will you?  i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats?
his parents took his car.  they're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
pop, for christ's sake!
having considered my position here at court, i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign.
will you tell me something? has this ever happened to you before?
three hundred and sixty-fifth bomb squadron? out of chelveston?
not for you, ray. for me. a close friend of mine was killed this week. the way i figure it, i stop you from doin' what you said, i'm one up on body count.
i know. it's--violet.
remember eventually revenge is carefully...  have you tired juxtaposing the words?
well, you know, not all algerians speak french. it's a matter of what school you went too. me i never really --
how would you like to take me to dinner?
alright.
captain norrington... i appreciate your fervor, but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
take at look at it.
i have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
something else we have in common.
the door ws unlocked.  is it always unlocked?
guenevere...
what do i get?
probably.
orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. thanks sweetie. millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip.  theo takes the other glass.
oh yeah. who cares? i'm the queen of typos.  wow, this is really starting to open up. what do you think?
cant be too close for me.  right across the street from it suits me.  anything else listed?
that's one girl who can't take a hint.
he was sickly. had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
three degrees off the comets trajectory!
yeah, i did.
go now.  quell was wise. he knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
when he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from vulcan, never to return.
i swear to you, argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one i ever build.
i think you're on the right track.
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --
it's early in the game yet, mr. rains. jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
it's a sign that you're crazy!  do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
spunky . . .
can you open them?
you can't leave yet. the doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
just ignore him. he's not a ph.d.
ann. are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
whisper it... whisper "fuck me"... whisper... whisper... whisper... whisper...
the official term for it is "clusterfuck". by the time beth hit us, i'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush. we're missing three and the sergeant. the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. but the sergeant...
what's that?
do those two work for your dad or mine?
hey, hannah, did you read that last thing holly wrote?  it was great. she's really developed.
the memory of who?
nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you redhook bastard.
i'm feeling okay--
just answer the damn phone.
stop, stop, what was i thinking...out in the wilderness.  under the stars. i've ruined every--
that's nice. my parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  you needn't concern yourself about me, young man. i can take care of myself.
annie's there. she'll be all right.
i need one hundred thousand dollars.
looks to me like standard equipment for the department of street cleaning--
you're an animal.
you know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about native americans. right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
was i at that dinner?
i said i hope she's a runaway. better that than she just disappears like so many others do. sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. a lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. these are realities.
mason verger.  for he cannot be free. dr. lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  can <u>you</u> be free....?
sir, you're gonna have to leave. you mind accompanying us outside?
look, i'm warning you.  you do anything, i'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
that, i suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
oh goodness, no.
no. we're never getting a divorce. we were having a fight. it happens sometimes.
nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  i think it's me.  is there a place i can wash up?
wow, man.  well.  listen man, i need you to be the keymaster.
is he from here?
that's it.
angelo and buster.
do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
i'd strongly advise you to join us--
not time yet.
nurses. that's why i went into medicine.
uh-oh -- john.  staring at what?
yep.
is this you?
take him off the air.
come on, ma.
for the love of god would you two give it a rest?  lord almighty.  in all my years i have never seen anything so pathetic.  how far did you think you were going to get with this?  neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  now use what little smarts you got.  if i was going to bust you i wouldn't have waited until after you killed jake.
men don't win fights with women, son, i'll tell you about that sometime, too. in the meantime, i've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. under no circumstances will i be angry with you. this is a total get-out-of- jail-free card. ready?
i figure maybe we can get the fbi to make a deal ...
is that why klute didn't tell me?
no.  i'm doing it behind her back.
with more bullets?... against each other?... are you crazy!!! are you fucking nuts!!!
ethan -- ethan, it's okay.  it's claire. ethan what's wrong with you?
who, levi --
he's not any kind of program, sark. he's a user.
i was worried about you, suzie.  i decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
you know something? i’ve just seen so much ugliness i don’t think i’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  i’d hoped to have a private word with adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! don't you understand? the fabric of history is very delicate. anything you do could have serious consequences!
-- i'm coming --
laser fail-safe. you can't get the code wrong... it slags you. i can't let you try it.
the band that found me and asked me to join.
something like this happened in santa cruz last year. the town was covered with seagulls.
that's my trick!
chicken shit.  where were we?
padua girls.  one tall, decent body. the other one kinda short and undersexed?
caen?
i tried to be late, john- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
we finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  where's pike?
i did read that.  they gave him a posthumous medal.
like your story is over.
in an hour they're gone!
oh?
hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
what?
what?
i don't think so.
whaddup.  money?
no need to apologize.
you're full of shit.  do you understand what i'm saying to you? full of shit?
every word.
sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
how do you know?
i can beat him.
who is it?
people cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. not if you have their love. you hadn't. that's why you're not in russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
hickory!
the name's reno.  this here's perfect tommy.

right in line with that burning tree.
this is detective stern with the arson unit.  we have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
let's stay here, will.
yes...
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
and he mailed it to hardy--
may i say something, no offence?  you look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
stop this, stop this.
doing well.  this is?
but she ran away.
oh sure. they say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
and benjamin sends along his best wishes.
oh, wow.  oh, wow.  oh, wow.
he got a little jealous.
what do you think?  max firepower or...?
well, what are we waiting for?
dino velvet... yeah, he's like the john luc godard of s+m flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
good lord, freddie! what have you got in there?
this broad hired you, gittes, not evelyn mulwray.
i told you.
all your soldiers speak latin?
senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
what do you think's going to happen to us?
yeah. because, you didn't talk me into anything. everything you wanted me to do, i wanted to do.
<u>laurie</u>! shut your mouth!
could we cut all news off? i know --
doesn't answer the question.
my blood will soon reverse its flow. it's the same poison she used to kill my master.  there is no antidote.
god, look at this poster!  i can't believe this room! you're the luckiest guy in the world! i'd kill to have stuff like this!
llewelyn --
uh..he might of.
i'm ready to rock, angelo.  where you want me?
smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
exactly.
well how do we look?
what is it, pet?
when we get artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
i thought i'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, teddy bear.
good evening. how are you feeling?
yeah?
that's what i like about you and me. we git along...
it's much safer in there, sweety.
lily and i talk a bit. you know lily, runs the coffee shop?
it's hard to tell.  they look just like regular people.
location green.  one hour.  iíll be there myself.
that's right.
what do you want me to do? pin a halo on you? you're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
how is the house?
you crazy? with all those people around?
damn.
rio de janeiro!
my god... you're right.
i'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....a weekly thing.
well -- williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veteran's parade and the cops chase him. he gets scared and goes into hiding.  come in, dave schwartz.
haven't we met before?
are you kidding? if anyone ever told me that one day i'd be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house, i woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. will this do?
it's on the table.
because you're still working for cohaagen.
i want to talk to him.
yeah?
are you disrespecting this court, mr. white?
i have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
to be honest, i don't go to the pictures much, mr. lipnik –
'every week by forty million people. i am a respected journalist.' have you won any awards?
yeah, we’re trying to send a message to hollywood. i’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. it’s just not reality. in the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
twenty-three, to be exact.
what?  president grant is...!
what have we missed?
are you open?
oh!
ah, here we are. steed asked me to play a hunch:  valentine peel.
you don't understand this guy.
what are you going to do?  make me throw it out?
oh, christ.  i hate this guy.
who's that?
i don't, that's all.
i'm not running.
what's his real name?
could be.
i -- it's like, i resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  to ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  everything you do is magic.
now that's the kind of motorcycle i want to see you on.
business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
yeah!
what the fuck do you want?
she's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
i'm not bargaining!
truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand. but this guy don't deal no shit. just quality. if you ever need anything, i can put you in touch.
yes.  i might not have been shot.
that's my dad.
after we id, we bury the body. case and casket closed.
these are really cold, huh?
you don't know anything about me!
good. i need everything else.
yeah, it'll be fun.
jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
wait till you see what i have on underneath.
there.  all done.  lift me down.
c'mon, luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
look.  i found it.  isn't that it?  cyber dynamics corporation?
don't fail me.
it's important.
i didn't put nothin' up.
how ya gettin' out, mac?
my lawyer agrees with you. he says france will uphold it in every court, but i will drag you through every court, don't forget that. and when i say it will take two years i am, as always, conservative.
that's my father. i got to run.
been drinking since high school. fucked himself up.  used to be smart enough.
it's going slow, sir. it'll be well into tomorrow.
what's all the commotion? where's the cat?
former commander?

i know, no--  i know.
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
it was a tough call.
is this finished yet?
he even got charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
goodbye.
you remember how a production eats up one's life.
say, sounds more like a guy i ought to marry. what's his name?
whoa, whoa, whoa.
okay.  i don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. i was paid well for my work. the health and welfare benefits are good. the severance package is fair. i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldn't.
it works.  you should try it sometime.
i'll never understand it.  you're so bright and charming and beautiful.
now comrades, i warn you... if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble.
you've got to listen...
he's in here.
but please, mr. kane, don't buy any more paintings.  nine venuses already we got, twenty-six virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
mordechai, i love you. i couldn't let you do this alone.
there was no other way.
it's not what you think.
typically male point of view.
neat. let's try it out on j.f.k.
oh, well.
it's that woman from the coach!
ah-ha. well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
what courthouse?
and it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  i myself would take it and run like a thief.
still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
what's wrong?
i'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
will the senator--
say it, jack...
well, i guess he's found one.
who are these guys?
hi.
move it, what are you waiting f...
they're right under the primary heat exchangers.
when it's a threat, you'll know it.
perhaps there is some good in you after all, lex luthor.
i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation...
oh...i'm sure that's not true.  i'll bet she's very worried about you.  i would be.
fairly twisted logic, max, even for you.  hey, at least you got a job!  watch her for me.  stay on her.
what!
that "thing" gets me excited.
what's that got to do with it?
general jack d. ripper, sir.
i am all right.
i...liz...all i ever wanted, was for you to be happy. i just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...i just love you so much...so much...
we'll always have paris. we didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to casablanca. we got it back last night.
i can take care of the paperwork.
where am i to go, jimmy?
how'd you find this place?
alright, i'll give you that. continue.
how much less?
there.
why does everyone have to act that way?
our expenses?
what the hell are you doing?
have you no shame?
look, i bagged it last week.
i have.  and my job is to marshal those leads...
i thought about that.
my congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
think boy. that night. the night of the fire. at the barn. you were only six years old.
luther, i'm looking at security.
afraid of lions.
what can that gun of yours do?
sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
frankie opens them with his teeth.
listen to me!
yeah...but don't worry about that now.  the hemmingway one is first.
why?
why?
just for the operation in paris. i need to be married.  they'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
bring the motor around.  bang out in front, right?
no; history. sooner or later, the lightning hits. i don't want to be around when it hits you.
it makes me weepy just to remember it.  so we were fine again, and then she got married to matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes tv commercials.  what about yours.
did they argue the day before he died?
do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
me. first break of day.
oh, sh-
doesn't suit you.
but there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness i couldn't learn to understand.
you should be sleeping, baby.
so, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. what've you got for collateral?
it's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
what is it?
i called connie and she said not to worry, she'll fill in for you.
no, baruch.
gee. but --
we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
the monkey, of course. it was his idea.
just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
a half hour.
ufa!
vaughn, get the m-seventy-nine ready.
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
elena.
goddamn you! stop calling here!
where'd you pick up your checks?
i'll come with you.
who's there?  anyone there?
thanks, melvin.
you do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
i don't think so.
carter?
maybe we should've tried to hop it.
you got kids?
where are we going?
that's for sure.
a laugh can be a powerful thing, eddie. sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
well i guess that makes us even.
wet. i don't know.
reward?
back is in new york.
she saw you with sheronda. so simone goes to the dress department with her robinson's/may bag.
you mean to take us all down with you?
terrance and phillip, you are under arrest for working in america without the proper documents! we got you!
what about plan c?
england.  there is nothing for me here anymore.
no one in rome has ever heard of him.  do you want to remind those few in the senate who have?  the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  forget about him.
then why'd ya move outa your room?
al, what's wrong?  did something --  -- oh, god.  you're coming in!  that's it, isn't it?  christ, powell, i told you what you're dealing with here --
she left you right?
doctor, this is da mayor talkin'.
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants...
hard to resist, isn't it? the holy grail's final resting place described in detail!
dignan. good to see you. good to see you applejack.  who are you?
case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
please, penny.  you just gotta trust me now.  okay?  and don't panic. because it's gonna be all right.
well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  didn't you read the sign.
not believing you.
i'm sorry, i don't know what that was.
come back.
you make me sick, you fuck. once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
i was worried about my hundred and twenty 'k'.
any chance of getting me out on bail?
annie, i think you should leave.
what do you mean, unfortunately?
i'm lloyd dobler.
oh. where d'you want the coffee?
ja, ja, gewiss! it is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  gentlemen! outside! please! do you want me to have trouble with the kommandant again!
do you want to sit there, jeff?
what do you do, tyler?
one for all.  all for one.
what'd you do? snoop all over the place? you had no right. you had no right to go through anything.
that's not bad at all.
are you okay? you looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
yep.
ed, the landlord called again.  he wants his money.
i'm taking up the situation with you now...
i'm on the staff of...
why?
oh. he's got it under control...
listen, you like beer?
anyway, you want this guy, he's in l.a. we put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the keno room.
only you can help me. i'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.
what?
there he is!
you were in insurance before the war.
... i have to go, honey.  phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark.
he won't last one round.
there's three.  the first is 1983. lionel baines.  the boston...
he's just waiting to take me.  when i sleep.
sorry. dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
where have you been?  oh god, they hurt him, jeffrey. jeffrey, jeffrey, jeffrey, hold me. hold me. oh god.
i really have to go.
yes.
oh no--
bend over and drop your pants, mr. babar.
well, just one.
yes, i do, it's very good.
you okay?
this...this is incredible. is the rest of europe like this?
let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
what did i know to tell him. you're hurt, ain't you?
but you could get killed, right?
leave him alone, peter. he's in love.
she's a...
not unusual.
can't you answer?  what's the matter with you anyhow?
debrief them again.  have you been in a fight, commander?
you were on a pilgrimage? to new mecca?
shadow games ...
-- that's the general idea.
he looked old, didn't he?
you're not going to... to your room already?
you heard me!
edie!
ha. some wonder drug...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
we work on rodeo drive.  but we're both professional dancers.
i'm better than the guy i work for.
no.  just plain ol' miller. now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
what is it?
i'll ask the gods to give you life again!
that's very nice.
jerry--
construction’s not exactly my line.
what is it?
it seems the tables have turned again, dr. evil.
no, no, no!
you have a little caffeine in the morning, i have a little morphine. so what?
yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some action there.
then what is it?
of course.  right in the trunk of the car.
general schmuck?
they send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. each shell costs as much as a ford 8.
wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me michael meyers is my uncle?
tunnel?
no, i'm not mr. dickson!
she just needs a new windshield wiper.
hard to say.
the thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. you turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
nope, not yet. their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
come on, you guys!  the game's over!!
six months, i'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
no.  he's french, he was just in italy for the competition.
now slide the nylons off one by one.
naw, i ain't.
well, dad's snapped up the idea. he's going to build a factory outside of rochester. how do you like that?
but it's clean?
janine melnitz, are you kidding?  do i have a vase?  i brought some of your clothes.  wear something intriguing.  i brought along some interesting possibilities.
i sympathize with you kids.  the best i can do is call the station in carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
heather chandler is more popular than ever now.
deck 15, section 21-alpha.
that was the best yet.  was it you... me... or the hammock?
not you?
that's tomorrow.
<u>hey watch it</u>!
well, i used to go to the dodger on your nights, and i saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
you asked for the opportunity to present your case. surely you must know why you're here.
oh, i see. i beg your pardon.
when you eat him, may i have some?
not through any help of yours, hildy.
someone like me, like you.  a pro.
no -- something real.  something no one else knows.
i'll have whatever she's having.
but . . . how could you beat him?
exactly.
is it the plane?
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. he worked it out in his spare time.
i'm telling you. can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! they come rollin' out like oranges!
you here to write my life story?
it's not broken.
and that's how you use the lapd choke hold.  now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
got a vehicle?  head north on 54. when you get to new mexico you've gone too far.
no.  of course not.  mmmm.  anago.  my favorite.
i did?
stick it on my tab.
need to lose myself awhile.
shut up -- yes you are. now listen to tee. we'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
we are nuns.  we seek solutions through prayer.
yes, it is.
oh.
so there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
the iguana.
i'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
you murdered gino!
earth... but when?... spock?
go on.
welcome home eleanor.  welcome home?  i've never been here.  who did this?
sergeant finnegan. name's right there on the card. are you sure you're alright?
it's the irish tape we want.
i had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
he was the best there was. that makes three agents lost.
your passport! what kind of a proof is that?
two years ago? sorry.
you're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver mr. and mrs. knox. we, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...jack 'supercop' scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
it was very dark.
mickey spillane.
hudson, sir.  he's hicks.
do you have a hard heart, marylin.
i would've come sooner, but...i didn't... how're you doin'?
do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
you owe wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
look... don't throw that on me.
i feel very emotional right now.  a bit out of control.
what?
i heard you asking.  that guy wasn't yanking you around.  there's no such thing.
we should go soon. if dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
please, sylvia!  it's a quarter to nine!
it's not too bad working here.
hmmm...44 long.
then where is he? he's not in the hole. we looked.
as an unmuddied lake, fred. as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. you can rely on me, fred.
"cotton".
bombers.

i think it's safe to get out now.
captain, the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
no. not without you --
sit down? what are . . .
thirty -- sometimes fifty.
it's your fantasy...
where are you?
patrick, let's just get through this. we have a long night ahead of us.
you tired?
she's as much as said so.  but she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... it's just an ego thing with her.
is it worth anything?
why are the police taking this all so seriously?
greetings king arthur.
sometimes which?
another unknown. not on the charts. a red dwarf.
yeah!  shh!
done.  we go now.
you tryin' to get yourself killed?
snap out of it, bomb.
...which of us is free...?

what's your deal with alyssa?
i don't follow...
how is she?
how much?
he was just doing his job.
shields activated!
yeah.
it's weird...
don't even think about it. rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending princeton this fall. she's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
i pray you: be succinct.
no, no, no. this was really sweet...
different how? different like a dwarf at a basketball game? or different like a lesbian in pumps?
one minute! just one minute!
look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
it's a lecoultre revers. you can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
i’m afraid i don’t understand.
don't get wise with me. i want ya to stop bein' a loser.
eggshell with romalian type.  what do you think?
lainey, there's no evidence that simone isn't real.
david, what are you doing?
their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
no!  i mean... why so soon?
but he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what i mean...
no fuckin' way! no fuckin' way!
you mean --
we've got to put that, into the inaugural.  "i have here, a ribbon.  you haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  for it is the proud possession of a few, a very few men and women... it is the ribbon of the albanian campaign...."
but you could bring 'em in here! we'll pay all your expenses.
mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
oh, many things...
so what?
let's keep going.  we're only an hour from devil's cauldron.

herr salieri.
hydrogen times pi...  got it.  strong sucker.
better now than later.  we'll still be friends. i'm dying here.
chuck, you're breaking my heart.
at least i have a point of view, you know?
what are you talking about?
buy yourself that island in the sun?
so.
you're so funny...
stevie, how's it going my man?  somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
whoever you are, don't call again.
perhaps, i could assist in finding them?
bloody well tell me who sent you.
she was only seventeen.
can you fix it?
mr. pekurny.
objection!  i must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
speak to your friends for me, jessica... please...
tom -- i've been trying to get you all afternoon--
that's it. just grip up a little tighter. that's it. you're gonna be real good at this. how does that feel?
it's her shadow-self! her dark side!
no thanks.
you're planing something, cathy.. but i won't let you —- i'll warn them against you.
nancy!
you probably know the type. you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. they always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. they dress and enamel themselves with great care. they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell.  tell me about yourself, miss mayfield.
it couldn't be me.  i hardly knew him.
han! hurry! the fleet will be here any moment.
yes, sir.
i wouldn't let happen.
hey, you, get off my cloud.  i'm talking to my friend.  1962 fender stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... jimi hendrix.
remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
he has that sign with the tree.
and that was all?
of course.
they've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
i think your dinner's burning.
because you asked him to, stupid.
people have worked this whole big thing up around my father. if it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. now i understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
whatever you say.
me? oh, uh.  no.
i'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
i didn't want to get it messed. i got shoes too.  wanna see?
now are you going to get a regular job?
i...don't think so.
those are cold.
say goodnight to sam for me.
you have no idea what you've done to me, do you? and after you leave, i'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. if anything happened at all! and i'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
...that's right...
sheriff said right off, i was under suspicion.  i didn't have a lawyer...
that sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
thirteen zebra. one-three zebra. you're going out of service in two seconds.
no...i was hoping to get a kiss.
get ready, frank. missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. there's gonna be trauma tonight!
[the address is 147 south rane. it's a lively address. you got a problem with dark meat?]

duquette.  forget him...
the poor thing. six years?
well, you got your circulation. now, why don't you let me alone?
you weren't a paper champion.
harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. you just can't let the world judge you too much.
i was thirsty. he told me to get a drink.
that's a great idea.
and so is your baby.  you've got more than just yourself to think of now!
besides my father, i mean.
why?
you want me to call you a cocksucker?!
no.  but, as you can see, i'm having some work done on it.  you found a real treasure for me, terri.  i hope i can show you how grateful i am.
i'm a lawyer.
i'm sure he's alright, bea. they'll find him somewhere.
hi there.
yes... and you are?
but the gods played a little trick on me. i was born in switzerland.
by accident --
what i'm saying.  but you still come out this goofball romantic.
let's get the kid home.
you two fucks listen up.  doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit technothugs.
how come it's my responsibility?
aren't we early?
what's that?
don't you ever stop?
if i were married to him, i sure wouldn't walk out.
maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
s'funny.  when your mom and dad, uh, passed away, i had this idea. i wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.

there is no contradiction between faith and science. true science.
as my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
so. is it true that gene simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? y'know, to make it so long?
you should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  these lips can be murder.
i hear them boys, those black panthers, they're communists. they don't even believe in god.
that's from the ... it's got to be from the...
not without a small army, nicklaus- san.
i think she'll like this very much.

i don't know.  i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
have you ever read any anna akhmatova?
i was thinking, i have to go up to boston for the aap convention and then visit winston-hughes about switching over our computers.  why don't we meet in new york for valentine's day weekend?
well?  you have all the answers.  how is that possible?
it's been a long time.
when was the last time you cleaned this place?
having kind of a tough time.
i'm sorry, rob, that's, it's --
what's so funny about that?
where you goin'?
wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
you could give somebody a concussion.
and thus unable to declare her love

my husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
not in my world.
well!

i converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
did you see somebody or did you hear them?
did you masturbate?
can you get us into straylight?
for instance, something like this?
did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
you embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
i'm gonna do you one better. i'm trying to marry you. you want to marry me?  i'm serious. i mean, i - i want to settle down. i want a family.

miss henried, i think you better...
come on paulie, share the wealth. you copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
you smell that.  you smell that?

he's gonna be okay. could do a bit.
no.  no, i mean, i really don't know who i am.  i can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  i'm serious.
objection, your honor!
would he know?
my father is a rear admiral in the seventh fleet.
i wanted to give it to you first.
maybe i'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. and a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
sorry!
dude, our moms arrested terrance and phillip!
this man -- did you see him?
no, i don't, i uh... it got burned up. everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. all i got left is what i have on...
they must've learned how to control water... i mean at a molecular level.  they can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  put it under intelligent control.
bullshit!  bullshit!!  you're selling it back!  that's an order!
you're trembling.
you mustn't see her, my lord.  we know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from lorraine.
i couldn't say.
i'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  i'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the prom!
like what?
leave? the honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
everything green on my boards, skipper.
he been sleeping in a t-shirt lately?  that's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  he didn't either...at first.
i told you i've never driven before!
what am i supposed to do?
this has got to be one big violation...
why i'm so lucky. why i should find you waiting for me to come along.
oh, fuck off. you should stay where you belong.
crazy fucker.
you?
we all set?
correct me if i'm wrong.  i thought we were on the same side.  what the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
good for you. come on.
it's where it doesn't get me. i've got nothing left that connects to anything.
of course!  dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  it's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
i'll give you ten seconds.  he is going to give us a practical demonstration of what i feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or i'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
you okay?
we stop at pancakes hause.
it's up there, on the tower.
it's possible. please don't ask me any more questions now. just wait, wait for me. i'll be back. i need you here.
in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison.  why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
hey, guttierez?
all i mean is... someone like you...
it's very good bernie.
you should have. i don't like leaving things unfinished.
they won't. they're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
no.
no shit.
cool it. we got business.
it's where i live.
yes, i've got it.  don't you think we'd better destroy it? so it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
yah, real good.
i'm trying, alright?  just tell me what we've got.
if you say a word in english, vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you, and that's a price i'm not willing to pay.
let's speak english.  you've got to help the side.
how old are you, captain?
hi kathryn. is everything okay?
transference!
yes.
did you hear juno macguff is pregnant?
what the hell?  it shut us down.
i'm not mad.  i am, but i'm not.  y'know?
and why are you always wearing black? it's so down.  it's totally not your color.  i don't think you have a color.
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon.  i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
organize a military escort to crystal mountain.
buy you a drink, maxine?
and let my policy expire?  sorry.
wha-at? come on, there's another t.v. in the kitchen. you know you used to have a sense of humor.
the maitre d' called you christine.
that's okay.
you rather take your chances with me? want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
26   continued:
the hat business is in trouble.
ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
you're in the stomach!
something more interesting than that...how could you?  how could--!
here, i didn't get any.
well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
no harm in your coming to see us.
i was listening, kitten.
hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  it gives us somethin' to do.
it could. yes.
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? first, you go soft on the pension funds.  now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  as of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
jack.
we'll burn in hell.  both of us.
seven-twenty.
ohhh --
no thank you, you crazy old woman.
you can look it up.
i know the one.
the black pearl is a real ship.
your name is lazlo zilagyi?
what do you want me to do?
but you were such good <i>friends...</i>
yeah.
i can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the mcp started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... i'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
just a little bit too much, i think.
yah. personal matters that needn't, uh -
he's very... clean.
call it a guess...
dislocated collar bone.  if any more tendons snap...  it won’t just be two weeks out of action.
you think this'll cheer dad up?
she doesn't want me here.  with you.  in this house.
and suppose they take the table away?
my family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston - imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
what are you talking about?
what about you?
genesis, what's that?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  you used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  were they true?
no refund on the mask, y'know. health laws.
i'm not afraid of her.  i'll see you get safely to the wizard now, whether i get a brain or not!  stuff a mattress with me! hah!
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. and his eyes were open. that always bugs me out. do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
i'm the one who understands you. now, can we be allies?
listen to me saying what?
don't tell me -- 'death before dishonor.' 'mother.' 'semper fi.' uhhh... 'don't tread on me.' c'mon -- what?
for the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
my god.
you can't believe how much he's improved.
it's okay. i can peddle toilet paper.
anything wrong?
professor, you time machine works! it works! it sent me back in time! i'm from 1982!
i had the craziest dream last night?  walter and kimmy had asked your boss to...
i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london.
you can come to my house for dinner?
i'm chairman?
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
but you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  now tell me why you pulled the plug.
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de niro had been in. or i could maybe do an al pacino movie, play a hard-on. but i couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. they don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
ravenous homosexual.
you're looking worried again, helena?
i don't know. one of your friends.
jim, who do you think you're kidding?  a doctor's gotta look at that.  you can't sit up straight.
some people can read 'war and peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  y'know.
paul, this scotch is exceptional.
you were. i have work to do. the publisher wants the transcripts by monday. go. make yourself at home.
crossing the horizon. optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
no vampires in transylvania? no count dracula?
grable, not gable!
you like spaghetti?
hey!  i was watching that!
you broke my arm. how the hell do you think i'm doin'?
yes sir.
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated. in one night i recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the e.u.p. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
soap convention.
yes sir, you are confirmed on flight 306 to rio tomorrow evening at 11 pm. first class.
highlander -- i had hoped it would be you.
wait! before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that santa's compound is wired with the xp 2000 stereo type alarm system.
mama, i'm hangin' up this phone now.
thomas.
what's wrong with him?
you always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
i... i can't find my seatbelt.
why's that?
you could call it that.  my eyes are open.
lucky lady. hi.
that about sums it up.
oh this is bad, this is so bad.  is it bad?
yeah.
they got, listen to me...
what do i do.  i'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. an annoyance to my superiors. a joke among my peers. "spooky," they call me. spooky mulder. whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. that our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
what is it. tammy?
young man, this faberge egg is chipped.
yeah?
what's the matter?
no, not yet...
why, who did you see?
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
please, don't misunderstand me, mr. richards. i think that part of miss channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for miss channing, isn't it, mr. richards?
i thought we were going to take it easy until the mission...
mozart plays shuffleboard.
you talked to wendy?
yes. he spoke to me. he said i would fight bravely tomorrow. i have never dreamed of merlin before.
actually, i just had an amusing thought.
what if it's not bullshit? if i bury zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
oh yeah?
if i give myself up in exchange for sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
is it coming out willie?
precisely.
right.  okay, then.  shall we go?
i wish i could help you, but i can't.
must be painlees pole day in the shower tent.
i know.
give it to me— my pop's job—
i was told there was a real nice girl here named joanne. quite young.
use 'em and lose 'em.
two and a half cents.
there's so many...
you'll be fine, ellie. now you can be excused. go and wash your face.
what color were the original hebrews?
i'm the distraction that's going to england with her sir.  are you alright sir?  are you okay?
andy! holy shit!
i didn't realize you'd been here that long.
oh, i'm much more than that.
it's the president, for christ's sake!
i'll be there.
tonight we've been invited to a reception at the presidential palace; to bring in the new year. you and i will go in a special car that's being sent.  they'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the president.  when it's over, it will be suggested that you take questadt and his friends from washington to spend the night with some women.  i'll go home alone in the car; and before i reach the hotel, i'll be assassinated.
so have i, actually... i wish it could always be like this.
meet and greet.  "i flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
you gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
trying to say something, martin?
what's that?
weren't those a birthday present from dr. mccoy?
wanna play?
:what do you mean "they" are? are you officially a woman now?
randall.
it's tainted money, doctor.
what happened?
of course not.
but the thumb always works. different ways to do it, though. depends on how you feel. for instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  that shows independence. you don't care if they stop or not. 'cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
they're fine.
you got that right.
no. not particularly.  how come?
under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
it's over.
i guess so.
you do not know what you are saying!
what did i tell you? supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  i gotta know exactly what you said. tell me what you said to him.
i'll have to ask you for that film.
what the hell...
how do you know?
don't say anything about anything.
the big hurt, huh?
so you killed them?
so you're talking to me?
do you like that?
he didn't come back here?
yes, something's very wrong, dr. mumford.
twenty-five minutes. we won't make it in time.
sleep all right?
who lives?
you gonna smoke the cigarette?
what?
i thought -- i thought he was dead.
don't think so.
not everything is an illusion.  my hand... wasn't that real?
david, i've been meaning to talk with you. it's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
yes, sir.
give it to her, dad.  it'll make her happy.
i'd hate her to grow up like that.
i can't believe they still ate it.
i'm kidding, emmi. what about a record player? you have that, too?
he needs to hire an attorney.
yes.
oh my gawd!
yes. now go along, mister mcmurphy. go along.
...screwup?
ah, good. new acquisitions. you are a protocol droid, are you not?
yes, sir.
most people are morons. i mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
y'know if you make it to the bigs you could still become the host of dance fever.  baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
you deny enterprise fired on kronos one?
i'm a tourist.
oh, darling -- i'll count the hours that you're away.
what'd they call her in high school?
but that's what happened before.
...it is?
darling, it's good riddance. let her go. and while you're at it, fire that clark kent. he hasn't been here in days. he hasn't even called.
you don't say.
then, i'll sail alone.
85,000 dollars.
we can't help *what* they were! forget 'em!
don't be nervous.
can i ask you something?
yeah?
jon, where are we?
well, i knew this is where my mouth would be.
yes.
hey! what are you doing here?
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
she does.
he *sniffs* that ether! i've seen him do it!
such a wiseass. but go ahead. crack wise. that's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  i got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  you make sure this gets back. the number's eight-twelve-wynarski. and i wanted to get a damn movie, too.
sure.
i think it worked out okay, don’t you?
four grand.
you calling phil and randy?
oh my god...  hello.
i understand he was in a fight.
say, the reason i asked about alan is that i bumped into him this morning and you know what i can't figure out?
the list is long, but distinguished.
that's crazy!  why would i draw attention to myself like that?
fred krueger's dead.  you always had a little trouble understanding that, princess.
show us the manager. he wears a suit.
that's right. and the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
i've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
no, not at all.
sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
not yet, mr. clark.
that's what she is!
where'd you find him?
it's better than it used to be. eight years ago they still had a lynching here. they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. my father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
come on.  i want you to see something.
if he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
you don't know where your mother is? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
you could host american bandstand in here.  why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
is--is something the matter?
i know that.
yeah, and my mother was a saint. for fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. but hell, what's that? you got a problem? buddy'll fix it. facing some time in jail? buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. you got some business that's not exactly legal? talk to buddy--
yeah, well, i'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.
no.  i was alone.  my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
baby, please don't... i love you.
and the baby?
depends what he told you.  about bill, you mean?
strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
bala, that -- that lake we found -- i think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  that's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
and it's always worked?
what are you referring to?
quittin' time, gus. comin'?
so you're not so smart after all.  i want you to know--if it ever came to it-- i'd be willing to get an ovum from the egg bank.  in fact, i'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
oh, god. that's two more than me. tell me it gets better.
now,  let's say the whole country. was in that car.   the entire united states of america.
c'mon, cut it out.
putting all that poison in your hair.
no. i think she lived her a long time ago. like twenty-eight years ago. when dad was eighteen.
you're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
you seem... disturbed.
seriously?  what did they say?
humiliated?
oh janet
i am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. this is the mother of my child--
whitehouse. next time, phone ahead.
no!
reverend edwards.
huh!? because of the slaughter at your same floor?
he feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
i don't believe it happened that way.
a few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
aren't you being a little hard?
no thanks, i quit.
shit!!
a dog at victoria's secret?
you'll get a heart attack like that.
he's queer too.  metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  on screen and off.  i'm getting him to fuck the d.a. for a hundred bucks.  that's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
it's just going to break his heart when he finds out i can't marry him.
we had a tough year.
where's your friend? he go with the chiquita?
go on, take it. then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
yeah, come on in.
half a million.
yes -
i'm giving them up. i've changed. i've found a new focus.
it's here, too.
thank you.
he'll never speak to a gaiijin.
so i'll die without a son.
operator, what's today's date?
it may be too late by then. these eggs will hatch very quickly.
so how long will you be in england?
she's right, paley.  you've got to kill me.  she doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  you supplied the coke.  you're an accessory to murder.
you haven't got a chance in hell of fooling pollux. castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  he's nothing like you.
that my brother, my husband and your mr friedman were linked, that much i had guessed. but that my husband had killed leon? no.
what would you like to have me do?
honest to god, ruben!
you're leaving?
susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
so you want to know.
what do you mean, old and ugly?
i was at hand.
i'm gonna lose you, charlie.
i see... well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
i'm two seconds from calling the police.
we have no money for a rug.
where'd you leave 'em?
dead.  damnit!
yes we have, jack!
now...when do i get a taste?
because we can't.  there's nothing here for us anymore.
everything’s under control up here.  are you ready?
we--
i should be going. i just quit.
you newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? what is it you call him - the cinderella man?
yes you are. 
this is it, beavis. huh huh. we're finally gonna score.
sure is.
you in trouble?
kid--kid--
what the hell...? bork! that bus we picked up. where was it headin'?
my god, what happened here?
do you know anything about building a house?
can anyone else see him?
did you see what i meant about the window?
jackie stop.  we promised we never go there.
then what do you want to do, miles? run?
hello, ronald.
you really shouldn't eat like that. all that sugar. it's not good for you.
but that's not true! i've got one.
...what's he got against you?
tyrell could help us, sebastian.
that's why you got scared when mrs. christian hired me.  you knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  how'd you find me?
i like the way you talk.
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom.
yes...
if i can get to the chopper, i'll meet you at the rendezvous.  don't wait for me.
air force one, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
well... i misunderstood, then.
who's fucking around? i'm not making fun. let's do it, baby.
you own this place?
no particular reason.  just to go somewhere.
it's over, hunter.
oh my god.
the fax machines.
because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
let's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us.
they found another note?
nice night.
but where did you get it, amy?
hello there.
yeah.
well, but see, i don't have 'em in front a me - why don't i just fax you over a copy -
it's all here...
out for a little ride in the coun- try, airk?
now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
yeah even then look what happened: michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me.
remember, phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
we are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. my romeo has let me down. i see disaster.
beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
i've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  in my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  i have never really dug deep.  not anymore.  as mark twain fully understood satire is the way.  race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. it's about promoting racial healing.
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
how ya doin', ed?
i came home early and found your note. i guess you meant for me to read it later. elaine, i've got to talk to you.
business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
that's good...
did he say what they're asking him about?
seven-fifty. positively my last offer.
are you available?
could work with a new switch. there may be a few more things hidden.
it's a little more serious than that, bill. the stockholders have requested a meeting. they want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  some of them are even calling for ted's resignation.
there's no hurry. it's early.
i don't understand.
you can't talk in brownsville?
nothing.
please?
the girl, lestat -
shit.
i told myself that was good.  that it made our friendship special.  and didn't mean she was ashamed of it. necessarily.
oh, ted, duh.  i smile at everyone since i got my braces off.
i do.
us.
rich bitches.  they're a plague. they've gotta be stopped.
good morning...  we need a name for him, don't we?
defense and state department in the conference room in one hour.  i want to review the iraq situation.
he pushed into me... i couldn't stop him... it hurt.
that can't be it. cos we don't need saving
name's otis.
you understand?
damn, that's sweet...  she really that good-looking in person?
i hope you find this comfortable. this was baron victor's room.
well?
it's a cocktail.  mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
no, excuse me... it's the yogurt that made me laugh.
big deal paper hanger! hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. like breakin' open a piggy bank.
hooray!  i guess that did it!  help yourself.
he's tired, chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. we'll both be watching.
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war?
i still feel...
what do you want to do?
yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  how the hell, n'nu'n', i don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
you're better at it.
i sure like the way he talks. it sounds like a race car motor idlin'. it makes me not be nervous.
what are you doing?
yeah, i'm out.
she was supposed to meet brad michaelson in a bedroom. she picked the wrong one. she had no idea i was even at the party.
was all i had to say
i can't see a bloody thing.
maneuvering thrusters, mister sulu.
it was nothing.  we were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  terry and chuck were...hurt.  you were almost...  you were even cut.
let's talk to your husband--
i don't think so.
actually, he sounded nice.
who?
the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
i'm in my underwear.
whoa. whoa. have really loved me? letty, it's natural to be nervous. but we're going to work through our problems.
wasn't that sweet of me?
we've already got an ambulance on the way.  don't try to get out.
new life defeats death?  follow the signs?  where the hell did you find that guy?
then we'll both starve...  an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
don't you see her?...right there, under the tree.
in my case it's necessary. too many taxi drivers write plays.
right.
terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  not the type.
hello there. well, well! if it isn't the man about town!
she's fine.  please--
has he?
why shouldn't i be in a place like this? i'm a whore!
yeah?
no. no. a signal service to the state. yes, indeed. and not only that but-- uh--i've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
wake up, cole.
you're here. home. the doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  what a night, jake. it was crazy. you kept sayin' "sarah, close the window," over and over. and talkin' to your kids. even the dead one. weird. you know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. amazing, huh?
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  i'd like the chance to defend myself.  i'd like my wife to have that chance.  my civilian engineers. my secretary.
john, may i introduce you to sir carr gomm.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, george... you know better...
there's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- i never owed that much.
billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
what can i do for you, lad?
and why should continuing excellence cost more?
it would make me very happy.
what's she doing here?
sail?
yes!  please!  you've got to get out right now!
alright. what did you think?
but what about lunch?
i got it all figured out, i know she went to wilson high school, so first thing tomorrow, i'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. that way i can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
o'reilly!
tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
yeah... i know.
he wouldn't say.
really?
we're dead.  we're dead, we are dead...  what are we going to do?!
...and you're even lovelier than i pictured. i brought a birthday present for mr. gekko.
they don't belong to anybody.
what's wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
nick!  nick!  there's someone to she you,
because as far as i'm concerned, he's a no good fink. two weeks ago i wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
'is it really me?'
well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. can you walk or not?
and i think better than the ocean. i'm serious!
your hair looks the same.
don't mind mother.
they not together, sir.  we don't see him in a long time now.
going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, eric.
new dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  you can change!
on the square, jimmy, if you'd seen winton down there -- i'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
yes noreen you better had. thank you.
true. i was a bit irritable last night. i apologize.
o sweet my mother cast me not away. delay this marriage for a month, a week. or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where tybalt lies.
what's the use?  the drawbridge is up!
i'm going to get it right this time. going to get it set up and get off it for good.
do i know you?
could be hers.  types match.  could be a lot of other people's too...
why imitate a dead serial killer?
what was that?
there was nothing i could do.  batman deactivated her.  she's dead.
yes. we have no real freedom. you of all people should understand that. this may sting.
you're sure about this two person thing?
so much for honor among thieves. you would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
koko, why don't you let one of these newmeats take your broom for today?
what was the fight about?
he thinks it's too...
no you didn't!
hi.  my name is violet.  we sort of met in the elevator --
dad, maybe i shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery.
i must go.
my face tell you all that?
it's isolated.
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
i think so, but i can't get close enough.  there's a lot of blood. i'll try to find out more.
okay, sonny, i want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what i want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  i want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  so you can see you can trust me.  so we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
honey, rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. now i don't think --
what's so funny?
uh,...apone, i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc, over.
thanks to god, you are alive.
thank you for coming. come in and close the door, will you?
all the same, you must name an amount.
we... three bullets.
-- he's a vampire.
look, i showed you my badge...
sit. can you...  [the chair. have the chair.]
uh-huh.
hey, i don't care about tommy como. i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i gotta give them a percentage of what i make! i'm in here breaking my ass, not them. don't ever bring them up here again.
what are you afraid will happen?
yeah, i know - picasso. <u>guernica</u>, right? that's what everybody says - although personally, i don't see the resemblance. what are you drinking?
mookie, what took you so long?  i got a business to run.
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
ready, ma?
why else?
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
one more thing. mah wife's got this leather satchel. it's black, about this big. i need ya to bring it back. it's real important. sentimental value... any questions so far?
nine-thirty. general von pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. shall we call berlin and tell him the good news?
...we're never all together two nights in a row.  maybe christmas, thanksgiving, that's it.  what's going on?
hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
maybe we could try it this way.
not for me.  i still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  otherwise, i forget. i just forget.  but you.  you never forget. ever.  so how come you couldn't remember ma's birthday?
bruckner's seventh, major.
erin. it's not your fault.
betadyne doesn't hurt.
certainly.
what the hell is that?
nothing, rose.
no ma! no!
rebecca -- take these off.
and, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
i'd like to have a word with you. this is agent matheson, fbi.
i don't think i should have opened my big mouth. sorry, ho-jon.
he's not anybody.  just a fellow i used to know.
excuse me, but...
are my seams straight?
sold in marriage and half way to america.
got tired of me?
molly!
can you even imagine?  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
i made that table for you and annette, for your wedding. i put a lot of love into it.
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
frightening thought.
i think you're mad! you're really mad!
you don't like him, do you?
cramped.  you always drink like this, so early in the morning?
correct me if i'm wrong, but i don't think so...
the family room.
why not?
well, how did you like the class, david?
i came to find my grandfather.
i'd like to speak for himself, okay?
i'm sorry about all this.
yes.
hello -- hello! is this the lying -- in hospital? did you have an auto accident in the last --
i wouldn’t mind. thank you.
we loved it.  we thought it was a masterpiece.  that's why we're here. we want to produce it on broadway.
i'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
that's because most of it never happened.
my mistake. i apologize.
yes you do.
sleeping inside me.
will you calm down.  duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. you're gonna have to be ready for him.
washington and holt.  dance club called "fever." know it?
no, i cam here out of my own volition.
he was a little older. looked like the marlboro man.
what do you mean?
physician, heal thyself.
jesus.  what, i live in a palace, right?  i have guests here.
it's too rough.
yeah.
i... i don't get along with people like that.
don't be an asshole. somebody has to stay with the store.
i'm going.
out. i've got things to do.
that don't mean nothing.  iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
well, i wasn't going to say that --
what's up?
you watch and learn.  i earn his trust.  then more pain.  then i appear with kindness.  within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
that's how he died you know.
...when you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? do something they didn't know they were capable of?
alright, alright.  go ahead.  when i'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
oh, it's all right. it's organic.
you all right?
doesn't mean you had to marry her.
i've changed.
now listen, arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  but he's not ever gonna change.  he's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  he feels no different.  he also bought a brand- new condo with maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
useless gits.  i was gonna do the post office once.
because i was fucked up, man. i just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
apparently.
i am not!
yes -- she did.
mr. helms, we've lived with communism in cuba for ten years ...
... chauncey... last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
i guess you're new around here.
wait a minute! you can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
who ?
gardens.  all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. they're like little villages.
yeah.
and you know what that area is?  it's iraq.  iraq!  we're doing a little thing with them right now; desert storm.  maybe you've read about it.
jeremy would have never killed himself.
dr. hirsch, mr. kessler cried out a minute ago.
. . .for his own good.
aitz chaim he, dude.  as the ex used to say.
ah, brenda ...  mrs. peel?
that wasn't your plan, was it?
hah! it's all make-up, chauncey... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up, i didn't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk.
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
ed bailey, you look like you're just ready to burst.  well call me a fool but i guess i'll just have to call.  cover your ears, darling.
margo, really...
she used those words?
that sounds pretty interesting...
that's quite an array of ribbons...
cold feet.
good morning, pimenov.
he's killed closer.
so maybe we can pull off a texas switch on cuervo.
no, they're not from wendy.
lando, is he alright? ... lando? are you there?  how's luke?
i am calm.
what is it, the kicks? is that it?
all right, i will. here's looking at you, kid.
terminate ?
hi.
man, i can get anything.
i have a cb in my truck, we could get some help out here.
sense/net taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death. everything dixie was -- everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sense/net's.
she sure does.
us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
it's warmer than i thought.
what's the limit?
there isn't time.
terrible. boring.
tell me, how is jacqueline?
i desecrated it?
let's get realistic, baby. sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. that's why you came here to kill me.
blast it, i'm already awake!
diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  people change.
you mean like we don't give a shit.
not a star-jumper.
i am.  you're not.
there's two things i can't stand, mr. masry. being ignored, and being lied to.  you did both.
jesus!  what the hell happened to him.
well don't drag your ass.  there won't be much of a window for us to link up.  we'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
what do you do?
i can't.
at present he serves no useful function. dr. soong created us to become active and useful members of society. i do not believe he would have wanted the b-9 to live out his life in his present state.
comrade buljanoff...
okay. i understand you're interested in one of our properties?
how do you do?
it's just so blatantly stupid, i have a hard time believing you did it.
is there any chance?
how much?
yeah. just checking. he being nice to you, dil?
i think i'll pass. see you later, okay?
'twas the night before christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring -- nothing -- no action -- dullsville!  you married?
jesus, look at you   you're glowing.
going home.
well why didn't you say so?
hello, walter.
good -- it looks fine.  we had quite a ride together...
i didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
you know i'm going to be twenty-five in june?
isn't this getting kind of pathetic. i mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. let it go!
no. headin' west. to can-tuck-ee.
dead, huh?
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  do you think that's why we're meeting.  to help us say goodbye to rafe?
willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  under the supervision of a doctor?
i think, before.
... eve - this has been an exhausting day for ben...
what's your twenty?
fuck! fuck you fucking guys!
so you're going to do this?
i'm trained, i'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
my boss.
you smell like baby powder.
what happened to his wife?
or somebody else there is listening in --
very discreet. a note right out in the open like that. next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
talk!  say something!
is this some kind of mugging? because...
do you believe him?
pappy o'daniel be laughing' then.
handsomely?... who sent you?
he probably wanted to drive over.
nitro, dash of semtrex, vegetable oil ...
well, if there's anything else i can do, mitch...
is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
i understand that. but, you know, i think you should try to make the best of it now. go slow, you know. see what happens.
hurricane hormone. it's flattened the whole school. guess what?
hardly new news.
you have to start getting into your character.
you stayed after all.
a sawbuck!
twenty-six. i'll be twenty-seven in october.
you told her i never said i love you before?
you have something to say, yamamoto?
oh, i miss you. you look beautiful.
i-i never expected anything like this to happen...
done!
we must change our course at once.
you really need to lighten up.
so what are ya drawin'?
you ever think back to how you started.
hi.
my spells always go wrong when i am observed. be gone!
yeah, i can front this.
look, you fit the profile exactly.  thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  you start thinking...this isn’t the life i dreamt about.  where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  suddenly, every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger represents a life you can’t have...
c'mon, don't make an issue of it. do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
there's ransohoff's. nothing but the best. come on.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.
oh, i'm straight.  respectable.
ole pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
get water!
you want to put him on your couch, norman.  grill him about his childhood?
i still contain fragments of my human half.
where the hell do you come off hitting women?
really?  but, maxine, can of worms! end of the world! illusory nature of existence!
what are you doing?
you're worth every last penny.
joe what does some island have to do with this? it's a mistake?
poor hannah.
you sound different. is that really you?
no... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? this is it for me, wesley, she's the last one. my instinct says i gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing i've tried to teach you here --
perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
everything happens once if you live long enough.
johnny...! i thought you were dead !
i'm on it
go to hell!
people forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
it gives me headaches.
larry...
not that.  the white house just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 combat exclusion laws.
why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
don't underestimate me.  i've got original ideas of my own.  warhol got famous doing a soup can.  what would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
did we make it?
you had to tell him.
toby's right. they're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
and the other car?
no more, lenny.
nothing.  not a trace.
no, i saw a guy shooting from over there.  he was behind that fence. what are you going to do about it?
we think so.
it's just the god damned english doing everything by the book.
cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. you must sneak over zere and shut it off before i return with terrance and phillip or the alarms will sound and i will be shot full of holes. got it?
tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
you're a cop...you're a fucking cop...i should kill you.
talk about work? never!
can i have some of your water?
b.b. it's me – jean! what's the matter? no snow in switzerland this year?
you never said you wanted one.
what'll it be?
wer ist da?
that's it?
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
our readers are, anyway, i don't know about the rest of the country.
maurice miller, couple of his friends.
a little.
i wish somebody would tell me i'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  my parent, she'll be okay. my husband, he'll be okay.  i even know who the bum is gonna marry. terrific.  she'll take good care of him.
alright. how about the master of disaster, huh?
how's the ipo?
who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
dammit!
park view hotel, room 1002.
i said that's 500 to you, holliday.  in or out?
and there has been enquiries from the american embassy maybe they are involved?
don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
well, that key's not gonna work. i had to pop the lock. you didn't leave me the trunk key.
we'll be praying for you.
we need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  hi.
he thinks it could be made into something.
you aced it, didn't you?
- and artistically, the most promising! eve dear, this is addison.
they sedated me.  we're stuck here till it wears off.
mama, when kin me and earl go to school with david lee?
i didn't know you had a secret admire.
so what do you want to see?
not that it matter much but..i seem to recall you staying something like, 'i was hoping we could work together.'
i know what to do about mother.
you got a flux and a half.
yeah, i could too.  but... i don't know why i'm even asking you this. it's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. i don't know.  i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  if just one person would say...
find it?
yes.  and i think we already know it will.
i think you should go.
well?
i needed this, y'know? i really needed this. just when i'm nearing the fruition of my project, big bird flies into town.  go ahead! kill me by inches! put me on the agony rack!
definitely!
i want money.
i heard.
yeah, that's too hip for the room.
trust me.
where have you been?
hello?
okay, tell you what... you can still be the school r.a., but no dance tomorrow night.
i think you know what i mean.
enzo?
okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
i thought of that.  then i said, come on, you're lombardo.  your reputation is getting trashed.  you want to stop the bleeding.  you don't want to sit in jail for three months.  unless...
why not?
it depends where you sit zozo. in coach it is like the bus to giterama.
has your son ever told you about frank?
how much time do i have?
-- and keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  some nice neighborhood.
didn't charles tell you, mrs. lampert?
jon, no -- i can't --
don't  don't you talk about betty like that. i don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. got it?
why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
what's that? what's it called?
right.
i know it's a man. and you know the rules. no animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
oh -- 
good work.  really.
-- i'm putting him on the plane to fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
you don't know what i think.
take it easy, willya? what about the radio?!
oh --
and so you feel nothing.
don't get funny with me again.
it has a pas-sion, 'the con-ti nen-tal...'
who was that?
i can't see, let me see...
...mason?
let them go. and i'll leave ...
personally, i'm type o.
hello.
the fortress moves?
she's a suspect.
i didn't. you gave me a look!
yeah, that'll do .. is that "hamlet?"
begging?  groveling?  any pathetic behavior at all?  will that help? faith's there tonight, and i've got to talk to her.
but roki said--
listen, i'm going to make sure steph and siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
i only got about three bucks on me now, but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue. why don't we walk back to my house? i'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
i've got to talk to you...
not bad.  but if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  network's taking everything we give 'em.  they wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  we're very big nationally.
and if i cannot?
that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.
oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..you know, i realize i've never officially introduced myself...i'm lewis lane.
you stupid cunt!
do you believe in hell?
i'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to paris.
i don't know. maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
but nothing is happening.
i see.  well.  maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
it's the next street.
i uh... i had lunch in town today. happened to cross paths with "that redfield woman." i apologize. i thought you were half-joking about that.
god, look at this place, it's the town that dreaded sundown.
it might be best to have a man with experience. maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
you know, a mookalone, a schlep.
i feel cold.
ted! what are you doing? you can't fly this plane!
what was the money for?
you trust me, don't you?  just give it to me for a second.
you're the one who found the bodies?
this thing works. we could go home right now.
it's okay -- i'll sit here.
my turn.
look.  do we have a problem here? there's no reason to have a problem. i'm gonna make you feel real good.  you wanna czech girl? after i'm done with you, you won't miss her.  now why don't you pay me?
i'm fine, kimmy. fine.
anybody have a cigarette?  but seriously, do me a favor and concorde me back to prison.  i don't care anymore.  i hope you have the receipts for the threads.
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that's funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, i'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
he ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  he took his time.  the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  the victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  that's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  popped him.
he will not!
how many men are working with you on this?
no. you're right.
is that all?
you know, i voted for you in your last election.
why do you ask?
just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
you'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
you want me to go to constantinople?
i would like to thank you for your hospitality.  if you are ever in paris here is my number.
i'm sorry about that.
i know where they're going.
no substitutions.
we're not getting anywhere here. why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
i mean if you knew karate?
there have been a number of reports in reputable news media - time, newsweek, our own nbc - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  what is your response?
we saw the terrance and phillip movie!
shit.
not bad for a three and a half year old! i'd like to see the public school system match that! i don't care how terrific it is!
i was hoping we could talk.
look, young man, the issue is simple. if you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
you know -- hemingway, sexton, woolf, plath, delmore schwartz. you can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
he's dangerous.
i got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
i want you to listen to me, carefully.  the minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. there are forces at work here you don't understand; i can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
his moods at this time were complex and varied.
look, bobby, i don't know what happened, and i don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
jesse, is that your hand?
-- easy as that, huh?
geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
i don't think i'm cleared for this.
jesus christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
my six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  right after he retires from the majors.  we just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
mighty decent of you, pal.
i know your face, you're an up-and-comer. you bowl on the tour.
so, cole, you been practicing your game?
uh-uh.
the second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. they were still under construction.
he's gone?
how's the weather down there?
no such thing as coincidence.  "god does not play dice with the universe."
jesus, it's too damn bright in here... like a goddamn spotlight... i'm goin' blind...
it appears to be...  ... an arm.
that game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
dead.  all dead.
walter, if you have a point, make it.
i was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. was it alright?
wait a minute.  how was lloyd?
salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
i think that you do. do you know where i'm going?
that's right, big shot. unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
yeah. yeah.
of course.  that's the point.  "i'm just happy to be here and hope i can help the ballclub."

you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth, nineteen seventy...
you couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
hey... ain't we getting near the next murder site... bri?
she's got to identify him.
she told me.
it's false sentimentality.
think i could have them back?
wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
say it, goddamn it!
that was a mistake.  the rain on my car is a baptism.  the new me.  iceman, power lloyd.  my assault on the world begins now. believe in myself, answer to no one... you probably got it all figured out, corey.  if you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
that's still no excuse.  you treat everything like a game.
this is ridiculous.
what's wrong, mother?
it was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. they received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  and the ship vanished from all our scopes. no radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. they disappeared without a trace.  until now.
i'm serious...this - this is a great american film.  full of violence and sex.  and i want my credit.
nothing.
which is?
proceed.
instant divorce you mean?
you take this much time over everything?
what? please? now? tell me?!
i've had it.  no more wirehead shit in my car.  you understand?  you want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.

buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape after i kill count rugen.
passed the todd place comin' in... what happened to 'em?
i couldn't find my buzz.  i know i left him right there.
all i know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. there's a recklessness in the air. they...
thanks.
what?
you sure?
the american said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
i'm here.
what about them?
what... ?
then focus on how you feel about her. because your feelings define you.   take off your gloves, michael.
ms. pomeroy... what's going on?
jabez! couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
what's the matter, george?  something wrong?  you look like you just fucked your mother.
you know, sonny, i used to dope a lot, and i was into dipping?  and i did a couple bank jobs, and the lord jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
it's the least i could do... considering i got you into this mess with those reports.
did you see that, wendy?
pretty much what you'd expect.
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  by what he said?
and you; you've got it all together.
who is that idiot?
i love christmas in turkey.
damn! never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
i hear you did time with old spook. yeah, he was a good egg. i used to run a lot of dope for him. fuckin' shame he got shivved.
the boys are back in town!!!

you put too much. that's two hundred and fifty pounds.
a loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? not likely.

well, i'd best be off.
she's in the desert. she's out in the desert.
betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
you can't get him on the phone. he's out duckshooting now.
let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a peter kurten.  we could use some help on the phones...
now wuddya suppose is eatin' george?
don francesco.  you murdered my husband, because he would not bend. and his oldest son paolo, because he swore revenge.  but vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  he never speaks.
i don't remember in detail, there were so many.
okay.
then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
no. you're with who you should be. it's like she chose you.
he didn't give you an address? he didn't give you a phone number?
no way.  no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
now?!  it's after eleven.
now what?
do you have a family?
have you been to the water board?
that's a silly joke.
hi. oh, hi. hi.
i suppose you want to know where i'm going to kill tonight, peter?
okay... so i'll see you tomorrow. let's not drag this out. we don't enjoy another that much.
i am on the track of...
that's too high.  i'll never reach it.
operator.
max.  you threw my briefcase in the river.  you've got balls bigger than toledo.
we got her mother's bed. you two got the rest.
bitchin' good cake.
ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
yes.
how much do i owe the milk fund so far?
it's s'posed to happen, biff.
but we can get to the west side faster.
oh, miles. you're drunk.
how sweet.  standing by your man, even after what he did.  you're a very understanding person.
i say when it's over!
real courage. that's what we want.
i haven't seen you in here lately, mr. miller.
sorry, king.  my leg's stiff as a board.

it is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
i hate to disappoint you, but i don't think it happened.
your friend saw them.
this isn't a game, parker!
yeah, go ahead. might learn somethin'.
yes...it can take us across the sea of simulation... all the way out of the game grid...to the mcp.

i'm booted up.  go, ethan.

what's that noise?
he's...he's dead.  you don't have to look for him anymore.  he was eaten by a praying mantis.
he'll double what i pay you.
this is mighty sweet, paden. i think i finally found my place in the world.
i'm going to bed.
goddamn you, cypher!
must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  it was always messing up.
let me finish!
what time is it?
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
what's happening to us?
you're not?
absolutely right, shut up. lashings of apologies all round.
you <u>have</u> to get out of here!
how are you doing, man?
i want you to hear me out.
you don't look like a college girl.
with a vengeance, i hated them.
no, the less mystifying.  good and evil are only illusions.  there is no such thing as evil with a capital "e."  that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.

with light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
you took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
i should hope not!
we live next door.
--millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  it'll just get everybody in trouble.
anybody else would have left you by now, but i'm sticking with you. i said i would. and if i got to ride your ass like zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
i know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
please! something! oh-god!
you’re the one who got away.
on the list of horribles, i know what he is.  and i know what he tracks back to.  you say he was involved in the plumbers?
shelly thinks i'd be a good writer.
mozart -
they learned.  they cut the power and avoided the guns.  they must have found another way in, something we missed.
alright, okay.  look...
i'm leaving vanessa.
do you trust me?
to denny's? i wasn't going to say anything, but why denny's?
and then we're gonna do her right here. right?
you ever think about it?  you ever worry?
jack. what are you doing here?
i wonder, if red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
i've seen enough phoney id's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  add all that up and i don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
through ... we found them.

and this is...  ...clark.  my friend is around here somewhere, i'll just look for...
listen!  that's some of what done it--the dusters. started it, anyway. blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
you have tranquilizers?
what's the problem here?
naw, she don't mind.
i'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
i know what i look like.
sounds like something you feed the dog.
winning isn't everything.
thank god.
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
it's in the report.
the evidence of what?
cartman! what the hell are you talking about?! you love terrance and philiip!
i like what you've done with it. when's captain nemo moving in?
good. are the newspaper men at the hotel?
your aunt?
i came to new york to visit my youngest daughter.
anna, what are you trying to say...
george, are we gonna do this or not?
yes.  i shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  i will blanket the city in endless winter. first gotham and then the world.
very.
what do we do with the humvee?
i beg your pardon. is that a proverb?
nothing there now.
the collected works of alfred biedermeyer
shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
you got everything you need?
it's not enough!  are you certain she's not with king westley?
tell me something, buddy.  you know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but i don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  do you?
i don't know how you died. the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
so maybe dr. becker would know. [beat] but, as i'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
i want to also, but until we are instructed by the messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
so?
it's a simple question. have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
i know you.
why... why are you like this?
i'm... i'm alright.
no, really, i liked it...thought it was great.
you got a chisel round here?
the landlady -- as far as i could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
jesus h. christ, i can't!
so if you detonate in...
mm. how, uh... how did he know that--
not who, food.  should we get italian.
how many guys they have on you?
xxxxxx
no!
a little birdie told me.  good day, miss daniels.  madam. 
naturally. you think i parked here for a cup of coffee?
i trusted you.
your pay.
daniel...

on occasion for security purposes, to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
we're really in a terrible rush.
sure. hey, but the biggest thing i didn't tell you . . .
not bad for government work.  having a good time.
come on you can do better than that!
good thing one of us was prepared.
i don't know.  smile.  sneeze. something.  you've got a bag full of money and a ride to paris.  fuck it, i don't know...  what kind of music do you like?
yes i do.
what kind of truck?
you tell jayne kennedy to fuck it?
tell him i'm coming!

i'll never understand your regard for them, charles.
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. i don't understand. what's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
siwash, huh?
the sign of our partnership.
billy prince is asking you to prom.
that was different.
then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair.  now are there others?
alyssa.
you're rich. what do you have to worry about?
how would you like the funds?
they do indeed.  daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but i don't care. it was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
i know that. but what's the maximum?
oh that's just nothing. that's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
how's it going?
oh. you mean, like, blair witch project?
so tell me you're okay, then.
i need my paycheck.
no.  we had a drink at the club. we left together.  i came here. he went home.
where's it parked?
yes, sir.  i'm here.
to rutagunda's place. it is close by.
i seem to be.
you're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  you won't care who's in your damn movie.
come on. harder.
there's still a big spot on the floor.
it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
what's your name, sailor ?
no, no! the runner on second goes to third! he's out there!
yeah.  how'd you do.
meaning, to court'sy.
there's no blood.  where's the fuckin' blood?
we could dye our hair.
sir, 655321, sir.
it's probably picking up another baby monitor.
it's a disease. it's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
oh, bu...uh...i can't say that.
come on, i'll buy you a drink. there's a big thing over at the italian embassy.
are you married?
you know.
do something!
where will you find such a girl?
...we had a script conference...
where is she?
lila, what are you doing in there? i need to get ready for my date.
mrs. lefferts, i'm officer white with the l.a.p.d.  i'd like to ask a couple of questions.
that will do, herr mozart!
well.  you're sorry and i'm sorry.
this farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  but when i got misery here, everything changed--she just makes me smile so.
just give me a minute.
and your social security number.
this is the bank.  this is the hotel.  in the morning i will enter the bank.

no.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
i'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.

mr. romance...
where was i?
if you need me, i'll be --
but it is! look!
you can start monday week.
through there for a bath.
sister paul?
yes! that's it!
keep the change.
tell you the truth, i don't know.  i started when i was eighteen, driving for my uncle cully and his partner, gus.  they go into a bank this one time in slidell, gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. all three of us ended up in angola.
calm down, dr. levine.
i think i know...
i'm afraid i can't really let you through then, sir.
it's all right. i thought you'd go back to new york like sam and ingie, and the rest of them.
what you're telling me, you're tired? you wanna go to bed?
i'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
daddy, did ya see that?
bud--why did you do this?
what's wrong?
they're going to kill us!

no.
but can there be a society composed of just two ants?

her left arm. it was numb. she said she couldn't use it. said it had no feeling. probably from the drugs she was taking.  i just thought i ought to tell you.
yeah, you know holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
what was that!?
i'm not accusing.  i'm asking.  do you...do you find me too...too giving?  too-too-too competent?  too-too, i don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
the cloak invisible. it was my mother's parting gift.
and who may i ask is carl?
you saved my life.
shut up.  i been trying to tell yo' ass that... day-day is my cousin.  they're right there in the back.

you were supposed to be this colossus. you were this great, legendary thing. and yet he gains.
i hear you brought a film clip with you. do you want to set it up for us?
you did say birds?
six months.  eleven days.
what?
you have nine points left on your license..
no.  he got tired of pretending.
for a while.  she left.
they want more money. they are trying to make two days out of it?
what if i did?
my... name is...
if i could do you think i'd be standing here wasting my time.  can you fix it, or do i have to go somewhere else?
to show them to the un, right?
wait, fred, what about your thing, you know... "digitize me, sergeant chen!"
no.
they're prisoners to their genes.
we're all alone, aren't we?
i have some errands to run, and then i thought we'd spend the evening...
he looks strange, doesn't he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
is this the suit?
see what happens when i don't have my orange juice?  the human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
yes.
rose, rose, rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know i love you? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? you are beautiful to me, rose, i've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. and don't you know mrs. hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
can we eat... before we go?  this excitement's given me an appetite.
i went down to concord to check it out. the president is mel gordon. the vice-president and treasurer is gordon lariviere. those boys are buying up the mountain, wade. $364,000 this year. i believe that's out of lariviere's league.
then why not take it?
what do you mean police dog?
oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
...yes?
i'm fired.
you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
if you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
what did you say?
casey? casey?
it's not a question of where he grips it,  it's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  a five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
merlin! out of the sick sleep at last.
they're stupendously successful. you can't get a seat. the only problem is none will hire me. they all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. as if i was some kind of fiend. i'm not a fiend!
do men have sex with each other in that theater?
yes.
imagine what it was like, will. no engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.

are you trying to be funny?
...okay. i'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  marty's a good man, brian.
anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't id him to pick his pocket.  there's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
this afternoon before i came here. he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach. i don't know if he lives there, but i can find out.
what does that mean?
that thing? who'd you steal it from?
oh, yeah?
my dear princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  i suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
so am i. i want to see you again.  i want to see you as much as i can before you leave.  i said it.
woody, stop it!!
i'm sorry. daddy and mommy are a little upset.

i know who you are.  that's why you paint your face. to hide.
from my perspective, what's been going on and what i've been doing is ridiculous. it's half-measures.
so am i.  alright, i'll go inside and you cover the back.
what makes you think you'll be any safer around here? it's only about a mile away from where you live.
you want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
first, single mothers don't "date." they have been to the circus, you know what i'm saying? they have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. you love her?
no can do.
here and there, scooter? here and there like boston, chicago, houston? the bay area? some action in london, 'til it turned nickel and dime. or how about that little stint down in miami? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there. you guy's pretty good?
most outlandish thing i ever heard tell.  don't seem right, somehow!
oh... a dorothy.
don't think that'd be wise.
she likes a stolie, no ice.
you got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
that's my business.
i would also like to apologize.
yeah, right.  let's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room.  adults won't see it. they can't.
so you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  were you mixed up in the drugs, betty?
lord, you're stubborn.
that's a good piece of advice, darrell.
i can't allow that, sonny...
what is it, david lee?
just a moment, miss -  may i?
no, i wouldn't.
we scared each other pretty good didn't we?
i thought i might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in connecticut.
how often does this happen?
would that be a problem?
are you sure?
oh - sugar!
bye.
now here's the deal. now that i'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what i want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. see, frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. we'd never have a bad word between us. but since you do exist, if i'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. and my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. you're a weird little shit. i don't get you. so wake up. face what they call reality. we're gonna be a family now. and it's my family. i'll be payin' the bills so you got me. but i ain't your daddy. you just treat me like i am. i'm the boss, okay. and the other thing is your friend karl has to go. we can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. see?
sure take after him.  never seen a father and son look more alike.
shit!  he jumped!
i can't breathe, i'm suffocating.
what's that about?
slow down. smell that?
because you're the closest.
that's s.o.p..
kids' game a couple galaxies over.
major, you're talking like one of them!
anything?
...above murmansk, and finland.
he's in his room, playing.
can i get that credit card from you?
he never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside nicole.  he looked frightened.
nothing for me. i'm leavin'.
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
yeah.
she's not!
i will, sir.
five more weeks of school. and ten minutes past graduation i'm gone.  to freedom.
i'm intruding.
once you pick it up you can't put it down.
you fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where i am now... staring at the brown & williamson building. it's all dark. except the 10th floor! that's the legal department. that's where they fuck with my life!
and?...
i tell you son, sometimes, at night, i see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. and always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
don't worry about it. it's just a b picture. i bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. life is too short.
no...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  but this proposition of yours is too risky. all the people in my family lived well the last ten years, i won't risk that out of greed.
the coach from usc is going to be at the championship.
hey ! i'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
eighteenth century.
now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
you're polish?
huh?
what's that?
oh, mom!
please...
we went to code blue...
i don't want it to be just one of our parties.
junior.
maybe tonight?
yeah, okay.
queen harry?
i don't think we should get into that.
what about yesterday?  kicking that poor boy?
the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. but, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: my attorney.
edward t. dowd.
no. i only led her into believing i believed she was... mother, it's really very complicated.
what in the hell is it?!
divorced.
oh.
earth to richie. don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
nonsense, it's all of our home.  so how's work treating you?
look, i admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. crushes don't last twelve years.
things are kind of confusing.
it's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
cancel?! cancel?! are you out of your fucking mind?!
well, i'm just beginning to develop my theme. isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? okay, so they played on your insecurity. that's human, understandable. but, there is one guy who doesn't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, adolf. he thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, i want wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get wilhelm. so, josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna, i'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin. that's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. hard. why did you stay? why did you play for them? why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  jealousy?
it was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
let's get out of here; it's too painful.  i hate it.  we went bowling last weekend.  next weekend we're going to the zoo. whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
no.
do you understand what i said?
i'm going after those horses.
the fresh tuna?..
what exactly did they say?
the committee is adjourned until further notice.
i wasn't.
somebody's coming!
you got something on your mind... "brother."
what?
are you an actress?
patrizia, what are you going to do?
doing what?
sir, i understand.  i don't like it, but i understand.
but you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  isn't that against the rules?
an' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- how'd that go?
we've got both.
yeah.
i don't get it.
i think it's safe to say yes.
why did you make me flood the school?
evan, you're hysterical. you study for this?
of course.
you know how i feel?
i could swear i heard my son call me.
i believe you sent for me.
you hear that, beavis! we're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus's story. it is a piece of shit.
were you pleased with his work?
i needed a break.
where'd this come from?
we have nothing to talk about, lenny.
another distraction.  it's not right.
nothing. we get nothing.
let me have a beck's.
my lateness may have well been absence. a course has already been taken.
go on.
get over!  get over!
what about larry --
my friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
your suit, becky!
they cut the power.
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia.' general textbook on the subject. is that correct?
when... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, i could not believe it.  i had to hide these... at least till i could confront him myself.
here, pick these up!
you like them, don't you, boss.
patrick, a mr. donald kimball is here to see you.
were you working for him last night?
oh, i wasn't worried about that.
i just...he was...but i gave him, i just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  he hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, i just had to go to the liquid morphine... for the pain, you understand?
no.  i want things very calm for another six months.
oh, my dear god...
trust me, i understand. i just want to say something to you, grady.
i'm not having an affair with enrique -- you know a delta gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! i just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
...he was. yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
i told him i didn't know nothin'. but jiggs and, uh, tony gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
did you make any change in this room?
i want our best people on this. where's miller?
what do you mean?! i could leave him if i wanted to!
what is it?
we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew...
no, i like music. just-they're-huey's too... black sounding. for me.
mola ram is telling the faithful of out victory. he says the british have left the palace, which proves kali ma's new power.
he didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
in the kitchen.
... too young for whisky...
duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
well, it doesn't make sense, nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
where did you get this?
you have a helluva way of asking for help.
hang on mrs. pierce.  not that tie, on the other side.  that's not the only thing your eating rachel.
they shouldn't let people like you into space.
well, i got annie all warmed up for ya...  she's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
sam, we got a problem.
i would cherish you--and stay sober.
he might have lost his way.
jesus, tommy, it ain't science, you know. you got your good trades and your bad trades. that's how it works.
alright, where is she?
thanks, jack. i'll be in touch.
i have something to tell you.
i'll lock on them, cougar.  gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
do you see that, colonel?
listen bo. this is very important. everything people have written about in science books is going to change. the history of the world's future is on the tv right now. we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  for your children bo.
frankie, you know my father respected roth, did business with him.
popup, on floorboards. and--
fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
holy shit. can you believe this?
i like my life.  i'm a free man.
everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about joey blow. when that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
where is my son?
okay, sir...but where's the cover?
do you know how to follow a map?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
give me a mirror...
i just feel as though i'm being made ready for the executioner.
is it the frank or the beans?
whatever. you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again. is that understood?!
what's the matter?
forget it.
cool.
last time i saw him he was this strong guy.  now he's beaten. and you <u>liked him</u>.

*happy*! what are you thinkin'? how am i supposed to take care of a baby! i can't have a baby.
you're heading for trouble, fergus --
we're here, val.  just tell us what you need.  come back.

no really?
no. should i have?
i don't "rationalize" anything. i'm his lawyer -- he's my client. that's all.
hey, buddy...
no! i won't have him back.
the day walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? for lamagra's return. one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a tide of blood."
okay, ray...
do what i say! now!
we've got weather moving in from the west.
you like a good saloon?
trip? you just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to kiss live at cobo hall tonight!
i didn't want to.  it just happened.  one day gary was there.  he took care of everything.  he took care of me.  i was a mess.
she was stealing.
kill me and have done with it.
like? uh...hmmm. well...
what is bruce doing ?
everything's gonna work out.  the kids and i...we're going to love each other.
diver's camera.  tom andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
i'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag...
thank you for correcting my ignorance.  i'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  i feel we make a good team.
ready for fuchsmachen???
i don't know.  maybe.
i think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  i'm right.  only two hundred dollars.
a promise is a sacred oath.
it is fine.  now, i must...
...i'm sorry....?
why not?
see.  ain't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me.  that's where he belongs anyways.  me and jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes.  he was just a pup then . . .
where do i put ashore?
they're my kids.
what were you talking about?
thank christ for that.
what?
we look good this year.
valentine...
yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
you already packed up your stuff?
no thanks.
jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
what...
did you see daddy?
it's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...i now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
goodbye, dr. thurman.
this is so typical. i can't believe you. i've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? are you out of your mind?
don't start with your shit. don't you talk to me. oh, hey uncle gussy, thanks for years of service. here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. what am i, a retired bus driver?
i come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
yes.  before we hand in the next video - i put titles on it and my credit is going to read - directed by oleg razgul.
no, she's all right. she's still here. but i'll get her home soon.
you wanna split?
lord, i forgot all about it -- sylvie works late tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. they wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! a couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. but--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. just says, "i haven't done anything. why should i resign?" he might *listen* to *you*--
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
david, need to ask you something. you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive?
my god, rose, what's gotten into --
taylor?
you're thirteen months older than me, frank. that might've meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
you, you just need a new flint, general.
what on earth are they doing?
what?!  what's happening?!!
i told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. well, won't you sit down?
i'm afraid she's going to walk.
we?
you were the snake!  right?  i know.  i saw you.
so can we consider you a regular, sir?
is that him?
you gotta kid?  how old's your kid?
what exactly do you do?
that’s when i realized i wanted to be a doctor.
i'm gonna be sick.
whattaya mean, why?  'cause you can't!
how do you think that made him feel?  what does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
mr rothstein. your people never will understand the way it works out here. you're all just our guests. but you act like you're at home. let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. but that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor.  thank you for your time.
can i help you?
has mademoiselle gautier gone?
what, are you a klansman or something?
jerry!  you made it --
i eat.
in that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
i thought there was something... that night in the club...
did your mother know you were going to see your father?
mr. helpmann, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the ministry of information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
chris, please.  chris, i'm serious. i won't make it.
yes.
no, you didn't.
i'm about to break that beach wide open, and i don't need some pennyante woodward and bernstein getting in the way of my men.
i'll be safe with you. we can stay together the rest of our lives.
good, 'cause i liked what i saw.
the phone number of anna scott's agent in london and her agent in new york. you can ring her.  you think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!

i don't have any aunts - and i've never heard of a 'carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'diedre'!  just who -
you're father was marvin mitchell..
ok. this is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
where?
i have to see somebody.
this isn't a "moral" issue, bob.  we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own.  vietnam, china, the soviet union: when you look at the big picture, bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
katrina.  why do you follow?
you'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. i've had a very unusual life.
like what?!  what?
no, i won't go with you
you have.
time to wake up.  hey, kid, time to wake up.  rashid!  up and out. i have to work in here. the slumber party is over.
c'mon, tom, pick up a job.
i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you.
first take your glass and examine the wine against the light. you're looking at color and clarity.
you will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
with pay!
what is it?
so you have had sex.
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the nazis.
i've tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.
you got clicks, anything?
landon. we've lived with this for over a year now and --
you don't get to have me. you are a monster, i'm a human being. we're not going to mate.
d'you talk to'm?
what -- what are you doing?
the fuck you laughin' at?
stop by later.
please excuse this interruption.
yeah. they're all upright till they walk out on you.
you think too much?
he'll need a pretext.  he'll never figure one out for himself.
no! don't believe him.
witless and misleading. why do you think he takes their skins, officer starling? thrill me with your wisdom.
are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the germans find out where dunbar is?
...so the whole book winds up, mike hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. so he says, "you rat, you are the murderer." so she begins to con him, you know? she tells him how she loves him. and then bam! he shoots her in the stomach. so she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "how could you do that?" and he says, "it was easy."
sorry!
startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
i was getting worried.  who was it?
i said i'm a dying man!
yes, heh--
so what are you gonna do?
what did we learn in school today?
you wanna release your air tanks?
yes.
i'm out of here.  jenny.
how did it go?
peerless, your father called.
it's all right.  it's organic.
not guilty, your honor...
and they want to blame us?
that's enough.
happy now?
the joint's not open, mac.  who's brandon?
why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
when carla comes by i'll talk to her.  she'll make up some nice invitations.  we'll have them printed up.
the who?
your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
yeah ! we'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
please -- oh, no -- please!
right away, exposition.
oh, baby, you're the bestest.
have you heard of jonas salk?
good.
and when he came home.  did he write you about this?  or phone, perhaps.
a few days...  when he heard, the prince of wales threw the bust from the window of the royal gallery.  it took four hours to gather the fragments.
it's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old unitarian barriers --
you trying to take over my show finnegan, that what you trying to do?
i didn't know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
now you listen to me hay-seed! if you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
i understand.
what are you talking about, major?
okay --
i don't think you'll hurt me.
will you be my wife?
i don't care to bargain.
jeebs is eager to have me deport him. but would rather kill himself than go downtown. why?
jesus!  are you serious?
it's perfect!
shook me up.  i mean that you knew her and everything --
new mouthpiece. been waiting two weeks for this. kids keep swiping them all the time. they use 'em for bean shooters.  what can i do for you gentlemen?
i can get you front and center. what do you like? i can get you mets, knicks, rangers? hell, i can get you the mayor's box.
and if anyone tries to wake me...
then you would use your--
because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
is she good in the hay? no point marryin' her just to find out. is there, baby?
india...
there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.
it's not like you've given me much choice.
maybe you were born older, george.
i know her uncle. friends of the family.
of course i do!
give me the god damn gum.
...not only an artist, but an instrument of change. we must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy. we contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in spain, it will spread across europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  the artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
relax, alan. the army has this all in hand. and mr. thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news. nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
how prominent?
will he finish what he begins?
uh ... randall -- ?
he hasn't said one word to me.
oh, will you stop attacking hannah?!
that's far enough!
do you really think so?
well, yeah, but i went through the program. i haven't had a drink since--
uh-huh.
i was as good a son to him as you or mike.
well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  when you leaving?
where in the hell are we?
me too!  will it ever end?!  i love this lady!
goodbye.
just a kiss, right?
now, where we goin', convict?
never better.
...  maybe three hours.
...it's a problem...
that's your problem, george bailey.
no you didn't.
sergeant, is commander skywalker back yet?
what are you doing out there? are you crazy?
a boy kills his parents.  they have a plane.  he makes it look like an accident.
i was awake and he was in my room.
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism.
you know what i'm talking about.
can you feel it, poppy?  the presence of the moment?  can you feel the weight of its significance?
and she's turned you into a servant.
then how come she never said anything like that to me?
he's hiding, the son of a bitch, in florida.
what about him?
the bowler? i remember him from when i was a kid. he was killed years ago.
want to go out and have one with me?
your grace, if i am so tame as to take this, then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
i mean, the whole sanitation thing. joseph lister... 1895. before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
and arraccinos and zeppolis. yes! i know it!
you talkin' to me about ramada inn?
no, last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him. i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. and my throat hurts.
yah, that can happen.
y'know what stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
you went to university?
zuzu –– zuzu. my little gingersnap! how do you feel?
facts or theory?
according to caltech, this webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
if you're selling something, i'm late for work...
bullshit, dad.  don't front me.  for once.  just tell me the truth.  i came from there, too.
plank road. yes sir. that's up a ways. mile, maybe.
beer or ale, miss?
well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
ida sessions.
hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
fag.
not really.
but then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. that's what lecter was hinting!
you here with bobby?
he must have.
looks and talent don't always go together, katherina.
ed!  what's with these revised pages?!  a scene in a smelting factory?  a buffalo stampede?? <u>three-hundred soldiers storming anzio</u> <u>beach</u>??!  what's going on here?  i can't afford to film this nonsense!
have you got a license?
...and if i did, what's in it for moi?
hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - i'm starved!
what a relief.
blowing the walkway? you come up with that yourself?
no. you're just crazy about "liebestraum."
oh, mr. dickson - they're going to arrest matt. they think he did it!
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
that's very nice-a you, aunt theresa.
hello, benjamin.
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... we were a lot closer than evelyn realized.
kiss your ass goodbye, reinhardt.
just like they say; no fucking self control.
i haven't caused... a problem, have i?
looks like we hit pay-dirt. this place is crawling with them.  see the valets over there? they're vampires. so is the doorman.
how can you read that again?
knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
you said, "you don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  how did you know that i made it up?
kate is that you?
he's around.
well why are they tearing the building down?
oh, you think so?

i keep telling you, it's the foundation's money.  father doesn't have any.
no. i only saw his back. he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
mr. chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a driver's license, a credit card, checkbook?
it looks pretty good. there's nobody back here.
please, o'brien, don't do this to me!  i'll give you anything you want!
yours.
i could kill that no good son of a bitch!
henry, i've been working my tail off on this. look, all i need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. it'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the bugler and your board of directors back home!
look at this.  the lock is totally demolished.
where is she? tell me!
mr. duke? hello, mr. duke, i'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... i thought i should call again, because i was wondering...
i thought your mom's coming up?
we're wasting time.
you'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
he's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  would you do it?
but i'm not finished yet----and your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--oh-h, atlantic, how i love you ----how i love you--
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

i discovered this. sec filing...  for the sale of the cbs corporation to westinghouse corporation.
i'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
i fear the influence he has on her. the man's word is not to be credited. he is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  she's having a bust cast of him.  in nero marquino marble.
what? what?
...well, it didn't make him happy...
jesus.
a drink to warm up?
are you the leader of tis group?
please, madame colet, i believe in doing things correctly. shall we continue?  two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- oh, yes, this letter from major--
tell me your news, zoe.
so it's time to go home.
who the fuck do you think you're talking to? this ain't a fucking democracy. you want out?
no thanks, i think we ought to get going though.
look, i didn't mean to give you a hard time.
i really don't know.  ben miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
report!
yeah. you. every time i see you. no more errol flynn, okay? your back won't take it. you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
over at that big round table. the one that looks like a poodle.
oh, my god -- it's miles davis.  this is "king of blue"!  this is the original recording.  hard to find in good condition.  where did you find this?
ah.
you weren't supposed to relieve me.
what's your name, man?
the same as always.
it isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he's got them to cancel the fair.
oh for god's sake, louella-
what do you think?
i'm going to marry the woman i love.
don't you wonder why i do it?
no.  i suppose not.  i didn't know you were colorblind, max.
he's so fine...
that's better.
sure. what is it?
why not just steal another one?
i've been looking for you.
you had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
maybe he can.
years.  this collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
it's not quite the face you remember.
dorothy!
oh -- too bad. did you quarrel? 
you charge by the hour?
i don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
her name's hannah.
to what? virgins?
primitive sexual practices?
no it doesn't but... i...i wish it did.
no.
what he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. it lives in the mind.
i would have lied to me if i thought i'd believe it.
the chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  by 18-hundred he was gone.  out of the navy.
wait!  wait!  there's something i forgot to tell you.
life mocks me even in death.
nice to meet you, fergus.
oh, thank you very much.
in a railroad accident many years ago.
you are a valued customer, as you know.
do you think i did it?
listen to it for christsake.
is her pain sporadic or constant?
and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  i know what you're up to.  don't think i don't.  and if anyone tries to get in here -- i've got rope.  i'll hang myself before it gets to me.
i know.  agent scully reported your suspicions to opr. on the basis of her report, i sent techs over to s.a.c. michaud's apartment. they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas.
what did you see? what did it look like?
i lock at you and i see bill...  i mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... i mean, you're right here... alive and...
jesus. you know, you're sick, eugene. you...
what are you going to do?
she thinks someone's trying to kill you.
m'sieu laval, i have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
your thoughts betray you, father. i feel the good in you...the conflict.
who is he?
good morning, mr. dickson.
-- the late harvest riesling, mr. quince, a possibility for dessert.
try the spicy tuna hand roll.
good.  you've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, mr. kramer.  how old is the child?
they're all asking how you're doing. are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
this is not good.
listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
forget it.
the only realty i see is that i'm a prisoner on my own ship. what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
this is my partner. we keep records of hospital visits. nothing personal.
what should i do?
i'm so sorry. i was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
yeah...
what was that word, young man!?
won't he bust it, uncle birdie?
well, whatta we got here?
i never heard about that.
i'm engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt. but frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i've never dreamt of before. hot, burning kisses.
you're a substance abuser, case. your pancreas was shot. wouldn't have lasted out the year. we did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
he depended on me.
tired?
conscious? cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
—and if it's all the same to you, i'm moving out.
just relax....
look, if you're going to keep bitching, macready -- palmer's offered to take him up...
you know the rules.  you do know the rules, don't you?
how do you -- the two of you -- get by?
what?
she died right in front of me. why'd she have to go and do that, sailor?
you're not looking too good.
...yes.
that's all there is.
you think i should hang around more with the crew?
you look great.
get <u>out</u> of here!
no, general.  i'm dancing with the war hero.
what? become a nun? you didn't want me going out with anglos--
hello graham -- joe -- mr. gardner.
i have to go, i'm sorry to say --
would you care for a drink?
but the romulans abandoned the plan.
sometimes.  i wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  or the creedence tapes.
the only honest thing to do is call it off. let her look for somebody else.
all i'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  money!
what do you mean?
better in san diego? more opportunity there? what?
is that something precious?
bloody hell...
elaine --
i say we go tonight.  everybody in?
then wh-where do we land?
she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  she just killed her own kid!
maybe we had a case of that here.  get me my kit.
i went back through the history last night. i read about johann rozenquartz -- i read what he wrote --
weak sister.  i still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. y'know?
i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut.  i'm a moron, okay?  you satisfied?!
dad!
because i can deliver the actual noc list.  the one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
and you must be steed. please don't get up.
you look... better.
i wanted to speak with you about...
dr. isley?  pamela?  you look great. especially for a dead woman.
they owe us, man.  that's the least they can do.
hey, guys, i'm outta here.
are you angry at me?
where's gilbert?
a thousand apologies. we have failed you.
yes, i thought so.
sid, cut the crap.  i --
impossible.  she was on the onramp.
then there's no chance for recall?
"really?"
that's not what i mean.  gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
mordechai?
i told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
have you gotten cuter since i last saw you?
ma, when are you gonna give up? you gotta bachelor on your hands. i ain't never gonna get married.
well the guy over there said...
no more water, you said.
it was windthorne. i knew it--what does that do to her love for ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place.  sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
yeah, just an idea i had.
man, that weed knocked christine on her ass. she's sleeping like a baby stella.
show must go on.
well, you're to take these after you've eaten. now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
three!  i'm going to be late for my shift.
then quit.  you don't work for interpol, sam.
he's a white male... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. and he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. not an apartment.
oh yes they do.  look.  one is like a tall princess.
why?
well, i don't.
more than your writing's at stake. the ministry has threatened us with closure.
i've made the scene.
no, i ain't got no word yet, rebecca. i went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp nathan was sent to. i'm sorry, rebecca.
yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
42 56 76......... okay, you wait at dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
did amber have a dog?
thank you for coming so quickly.  the guests are starting to ask questions and i'm running out of excuses.
amnesia.
i am, gaston.
i can't talk right now.  we have some things to take care of.
this isn't mine. wait, where is that kid?...
after everything.
how did he die?
i wish you wouldn't pick on rose and tease her like that. of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
what's the difference?
well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
you said it was in the rolltop desk!
forgive me if i have offended you.
learning about cuba. having some food.
i was just clearing my throat.
jesus, ethan.  good for you.
so how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a u.s. marshal?
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.
i'll take odds on cecil number two.
what i've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like i said, the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix.
i'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  at least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
uncle frank?
so you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  he <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  how he was born a magician.
dreyfuss.
you're parents at that party?
to relax.
yep.
you just stay put.  you need rest.
maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
there. now you've got your profit and more. you'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
get me major callaghan on the phone.
we been through this before--
because my mother was dying! but now she's not.
what class?
no!
he's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
hey, rico, wanna dance ?
who are they?
exactly.  here. take it to the party instead of me.
think of it as special assignment, mrs. peel. with a twist. you're our chief suspect.
lay down.  stay down, bobby.
then why do you keep running away?
keep warm now.
just back up.
she's fine. you really think i'd be a good investment?
talk to me.
is it all right?
forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into canada so they could get work in order to eat.  only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
oh no... no....
what are you doing, veidt?
so talk to us about something.
say roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink & paint club?
well, commercials. i read for a soap the other day.
are you <u>alright</u>...?
her chaperone. my lady's country cousin.  my, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! you may call me miss wilhelmina!
excuse me, boys. i'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
hey butt-head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
he won... and they killed robert kennedy.  they shot him down.
no way.
were we together?
... which i hope will make you very happy.
no, he left last week.
oh my god, you are so adorable. i just....god dammit.
i like working for the bureau, sir. i like catching bad guys. it's all i care about.
one-forty-eighth of a second.  that's how long it's up there.
well, that's, that's, i'm not go inta, inta - see, i just need money. now, her dad's real wealthy -
john, you still there?
he'll care all right. that was going to be his money. whether he cares about us is different. pass your phone.
whewww! those acts of god really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
madame vice president. we have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off lee, and reads it as she talks.
yes.
no.
garcetti thinks i'm a pile of shit.
where the hell you been?
under the circumstances, general, what would you think they should do?
that's right. you didn't.
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
do i have to spell it out?
are you ill?
i, uh... money, yeah, i gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
me, too. y'all just seen me play my last game.
ignorant.  the thing's ignorant.
yeah. how's mom?
no, no it's okay.
he will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  he'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
how should i take it?
oh shit.
hey, poldek, how's it going?  you know about the list?  you're on it.
mr. corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona? or any gambling interests in that state?
where you going?
that was an ark, man. that was a torah. they fucked around with it, and the torah melted their faces.
... and while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
but they don't know about the translation!  they could be in danger right now.
it's all fixed!  osgood is meeting us on the pier -
mr. and mrs. alain charnier, would be another.  he's in shipping.
oh, shit.
look, old man, you stay out of this. we spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. and then you think you can -
polacks and deadbeats.
what did you get us?
no! please!  shut up, will you? we're trying to think here.  it is sort of like being a puppeteer. i like that about it.
move!
there's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. you be careful of it, won't you dear?  it's always helped keep your father alive for me.
what? where're you--hey, where in the hell are you going?
no.
dear, this is mr. rossen, he is the producer...
i didn't go in your room.
you did all this for me?
well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
look!
mr. kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. it is large and on the front with bath.
you threaten me with my uncle? after what i'm doing for you?
i'm warning you.
same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. there sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
...excuse me.
business hours are over, sir. this is the switch...
shit. you're not planning --
your baby?
what about now?
don't worry.
no, i have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
i believe these young men are right.
cadet, what's your name!
let's open it.  now...
jake, is that you?
hi.
how much did you figure to make?
i think the ground's getting closer.  i think we do it.  we're gonna save our asses here!
i see.  and this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  a sort of retroactive abortion?
let's make it three thousand dollars a game, fats. c'mon, three thousand dollars. that's my bankroll, my life's savings.  what's the matter, fats? all you gotta do is beat me the first game and i'm on my way back to oakland.
who?
i'm not. it's just corny, but i'm not into it.
thanks.
like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
clarence.
i was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
i wonder if we ought to--
you should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
nice try. everyone thinks i did.
i just play my own collection.
that was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
you're a very beautiful girl.
nobody is freer than when he dreams.  i read that.
i -- i can't jeanne... i can't hear your confession... i'm sorry...
how!
what is enough?
well, alexander, as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions --
freddie?... freddie, don't look so discouraged.
did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
shut up, tommy!
it's not your fault.  you're right.  kit's right.  but i want the fairy tale.
then listen to this: i have to get those leads tonight.  that's something i have to do.  if i'm not at the movies...if i'm not eating over at the inn...if you don't do this, then i have to come in here...
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you.
...ting the ruby slippers?
just like a ghost ship, huh?
you try it.
can i help you?  russ yelburton, deputy chief in the department.
no, no, it's not a threat, i've explained all of that.
shoot him.
yes, it must be.
why do all you dames have to live in the bronx?
it's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
mr. maranzano sends his warmest regards.
you were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? oh god, i <u>am</u>!  make them some coffee.  halloran, is it?  investigator goetz?  i had a crank call myself-- he said...  i thought it might be daryll lee cullum.  i thought he might be out of prison.
...and i from phyllis.
were you going somewhere tonight, jeff?
that's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
i was faking it.  i've been feeling caged for sometime.  funny, huh?
a new invention?
no, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, uriah bloodworth.
so why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
easy, easy,  easy, scotty. easy. you're back with us.
neither am i.
you heard mr. sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
my compliments.  i'll take care of them from my share.
so they’ve got him up and running.
why?
rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
make it my first born.
fuck.
david, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
i plan to.  you want a tip?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
we're bringing in your wife...
hey, bud.
will bogey get bent?
what are you doing up?
are you going, too?
i'm at 8150 wonderland avenue. it's right off laurel.
yeah. this is it. i have some shopping to do.
one of us pays the other for half.
well, i don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. it takes a while to get used to.
i know, but i've been thinking --
oh.  the navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
well... well, is everyone all right?
i was wondering whether you'd come at all..
well i...i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
we gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. why'nt you an' ray come on over.
wait --
nothing... there's your ninepence.
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
...i'd like to be alone for a while.
oh yeah?  what was 'fascinating' about it?
i'm going to go in.
she's too genuine.
no, no, that is uhmed singh, the present maharajah's late father.
we still think the temporal lobe...
don't leave me.
what's he doing?
petty thief, six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary, 1937.
cameras?
i understand.
someone who follows his heart!
you mean 'ted bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
good day to you, m'lords.
why?
it's nice to meet you.  my husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
okay, good, this is all very noble.
well, he has a straw hat--
like do you believe in heaven?
excuse me - didn't his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
i know, i ...
he looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
you're joking.
i like women who wear mismatched earrings.
i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  he's a cop?
rose, i don't have time for this.
how is our current financial status?
my associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  he's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. hmmm. i can't seem to find any record of it.
oh yes, she's... wonderful.
cora, is something wrong with the laser?
i don't know.  i may be in love with him.
years ago. and it was zaltar who stole it.
permission to get dressed, sir?
but i thought you'd be cool if...
i think we should leave now.
you want a hit?
well, are you going out again?
if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
you again.
that feller's a whole sight meaner than me. he'd just whup the tar out of me.
they're not in any pain.  we keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
who cried that one?
oh dick, come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance.
all right, kent. i just hope you know what you're doing. if you really think smallville is your big chance, go for it.
i can't. i can't. you think you know so much.
nice room. balcony and everything. lovely view too.
wrong. fratricide is when you gun down your brother. you're out. my turn.
defense against what?
but now you can't go.
where's my daughter?
peanut butter and jelly.
that sounds charming.  did you meet any interesting people today?
so you've made up your mind to go to the party.
i'm hurting
oh shit.  harry... what're you doing?
the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...
oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  we're going someplace you never been before.
running out of time, are we? tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
yeah, she's a ten, max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
you just took a shot at me, asshole. i think you do know where he is.
the exercise was one of his section eight "private sessions". left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
now what?
she never gives him a turn.
what's this guy's problem?
you know i think they think i should be king.  although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose i were king and then everything went wrong.
i'm captain john harriman. i'd like to welcome you all aboard.
are you a fag?
but she's your mother. you gotta tell her.
he said it was a gift.
you better not fuck this up.  i'm heavily invested.
i know him too.
you can but i wish you wouldn't ...
i felt a little guilty, so i got out some of your old stories.
i don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, i want you to look for something called a holiday inn. write that down. it's a hotel. there might still be one standing.
a lowly player.
yes, stop!  i wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  what's wrong?
what is this?  who did this?
that's because the ones that were hurt, died. they couldn't talk to you.
i'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
you ain't lying.
he says that his father's hurt.
i'm sorry, but i'm not here to be your savior.
you should warn them, sonny.
accused. not indicted. he resigned the firm. divorced nineteen seventy. galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. since then he's been on his own. four cases before the circuit court. he lost them all. he drinks.
i guess what i mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then i was born, so i thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
it isn't that she hasn't got any sense, doll. her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
i've got to ask somebody.
do i know you? weren't you on the set the other night? with ramada.
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
have you counted the money?
i've been knocking.  the door was open. is everything all right in here?
really?
but before! where did you live before!?!
cutting it a little close, don't you think?  so how was she? compared to stephanie, say.
susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as siri...
i don't want it to go away.
months now.  he's been feeding me information on dmitri.
what are you talking about?
now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  we won't keep books.  go on, unpack mr. gillis' things.
so, what-you're stuck here all day?
break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
that's the satan's disciples' new york headquarters.
naw, i already ate.
uh, yeah, being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
i want to know who we give the public in contrast?  the department needs role models. clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
come on, man, i'm starting to cramp up here.  we have the chance right here, right now, i say we go!
but how are we gonna --
i'm looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, i'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.
it's okay...it's okay baby. cry for mama. cry for mama.
the sign says strawberry finches.
why we're just standing here.
what can i tell you? he's my leader.
maybe i ought to go out there.
we'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  school and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. this has to be handled delicately. dan kelly, in the district attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  christ, this could be embarrassing.
then you shouldn't have to ask.
if anybody's to blame, it's me -- i oughta nailed him when i took that shot.
disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
you look a little morose, honey. what's eating you?
but you don't know what happened.
no. not tomorrow, not next week, marry me today.
there's a reception this evening. colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend.
well.  it was a pleasure meeting you.
look at this!  "hillside strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
at what?
i guess you've seen some bad things.
if we keep going up, they'll catch us!
you touch me again and--
i don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  i can't print this surreal garbage!
i love those doors.
how do you mean?
oh, i'm sorry, harry! i didn't know! i thought maybe --
you have a car?  so...  i don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
what you mean talk to her?
now remember, this is another kind of business. they don't earn your respect. you owe it to them. don't stare them down but don't look away either. confidence. they are fools not to trust you. that's the attitude.
i know.
get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
what was it, jack?
this is a little different.
yes sir.
okay, fella.  but just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
loki! where did you come from?
yes.
stop where you are.
it's not gonna hold us.
no you look, mister! first, you don't go calling my men names. it's bad for morale. second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
you busted me.
not yet you know any of these people?
next time, bet with your own kind.
bullshit. walter!
sargent.  establish a recon post downstairs.  code red.  you know what to do.
i've left my <u>program</u>...
good.
i don't know.  they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
in what way?
very good, chief. they inspect cells.
what's goin' on?
i love zoos.  ever since i was a kid.
what?
what's your fucking problem?
oh, by the way - i'm eve rand.
well, it's too late now, isn't it?
she's down...
no. seventy-five -- seventy-five.
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i'll tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
thanks for a swell time.
it's okay.
look, dave your've probably got a lot to do. i suggest you leave it to me.
go fuck yourself.
are we understood?
how do you know?
oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
someone has to do it, mrs. lampert --
yeah?
where'd you all go?  motherfucking frat boys.  you better hide.  is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
that's what i'm here for.
what does it say?
there's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
--now he wants to talk to the congressmen from the willet creek districts--he's run their names down--
wockers with the knockers???
i don't understand.
i don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
if i'm not taking you away from anything.
you think he could still be in town?
what? what?
uh, er... i...
guess who i did it with last night...
where'd he go?
how do you know? you been there?
melanie, melanie...
no -- just there -- on the first level.  don't look for us. we'll see you.
well, mister beauchamp, i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran... an' i didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
smells good.  when do we eat?
what?
good-bye, darling. i love you. i love you, darling.
so you say.
they never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  what if breuning and carlisle took them from the evidence room?  couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
when kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
who are you?
you have a strong unfufilled desire.
we're a little emotional here.  it's christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
yeah, ok.
how do you figure?
yes?
i'm at bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. i thought we might have lunch together.
i think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
but putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
how'd you know to have the calf ready, ma?
i hate him, i hate it. sometimes i love it. but now i'm afraid. i am so afraid.
i'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
he wants to see you. lex luthor.
do you like baseball?
now you're being bright?
it's not so bad these days. kids like joint custody. two sets of toys.
danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
no sir he didn't.
so you want me to take her out?  is that an order from the president?
there's always a choice.
they ain't sendin' nicky nowhere.
go away, nosey.
a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer. i'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
saber tooth tiger!
thank you.
yeah.
are you okay, jonesy?
now, you can take care of the dauntless, right?
hi, bill --
i never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
i like it well done.
i have.  spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i weren't such a coward, i'd kill myself.
any powder?
i won't deceive you, mister striker. we're running out of time.
i don't see anything, do you?
if she calms down, i will let her in the house.
i hope you like large weddings.
she loved him.
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
it's better to split up, to increase our chances. we must change hiding places, and change them continually ... in the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
no options.
ta.
i am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  these are <u>my</u> children.  they don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
it's a scandal, franco.
i not only know him, deanna, i am him.. and he is me!
it made them holy.
they don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  sam adams never did.
that greek guy who won at the end. you paid him out in 25s not 20s.
how've you been?  how's teaching?  i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
so when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? like, do you dream?
in case you've never heard of how i lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. we can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. he fought seventeen major engagements in the war. all successful. beyond that, we know nothing.
no, no, that would be crazy --
are they treating you okay?
thanks just the same.
before that. your face is very familiar.
is that what it is?  dollars? money?  i'll pay for it.  take it out of my salary.
i don't know.
homer... doesn't king kong think the woman is his *mother*?
of course, don’t be silly.
are you annie?
gonna lose everybody out here....
you lied to me
it's what he did.  i'm proud of him.
almost done.
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
please call me leonard. my wife called me lenny.
any sign of the hostages?
you told me bourne was dead.
what did she tell me, beth?
you kids go to bed on time! you've got school tomorrow!
hi.
you had a car full of stuff.  were you leaving?
ah... no...
scumbag. what are you doing?
well ... of course i have.  i've thought.  i've ... oh, jp, you were so horrible.  you really hurt me ...
well, you're not that bad, but some people... i mean, people's homes, just filth. i've been in people's homes...
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate break-in and cover-up were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning ...
lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  if you ask me, he's one giant bore.
it's just you and me, then.
where is your wife?
good night, eve.
-- where? -
come on, baby. i don't pay that shit no mind.
it's running three meters down. twenty knots.
...it's not over, 'til it's over.
yeah, that's easy for you to do. you never had any talent.
you killed them?
because i don't want one.
...jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. he used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. now he's like everyone else.
...shut up, sue...
probably not.
quiet!... quiet!!!... awright, everybody, nick has a few words.
have we got something for you. something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
she is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
what's going on now? what's he doing?
well, what do you think?
don't think it's even an issue.
we don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
don't worry, george. nothing's going to happen. i'll fall right into line. i'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. i'll be the best little foreign secretary we ever had, just because i haven't the nerve to be anything else.
...this the guy.
i see. you're good, because i didn't hear anything.
first off, this mr. chow yen doesn't speak a lot of english. the girl with him will interpret. there will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  i hope you know krugerands better than they know a <u>hockney</u>.
i know, i know!  gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war.  james penfield.  he wrote the opening chapter, on 'the berlin airlift'.  one of the best chapters in the book.
that's got nothing to do with it!
fine...
the answer is no.
he's not with us, xander. he must be with you.
where'd you get this?
sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
hell, i couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
what is it?
cause you're the man, right?  the magic man.  if it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
well, i'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
they killed casy first.
it's an antidote. a formula.  whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
sure, all drifters do.
you okay, man?  i mean, what just happened.
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds?  with what's out there?
it's time.
i just kept reading them over and over. i know when i finish this one-- and i've only got two chapters to go-- i'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
it was off the statue.  in the club.
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
well, i thought i'd maybe take in a hoedown.
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
and if we don't happen to find it under palmer's mattress or inside karen flores' undie drawer? what then?
i don't submit to blackmail!  the first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as i imagine it, and--
i should say you had. at the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
could he have been at all conscious?
welsh.
are we on "cops" again?
the young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
let me check the zip - 212 fuck you?
come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
on the phone?
i mean it as a compliment. you've got such great taste, i don't know. most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. used to say, the cream of america: rich and thick. freddie's the perfect example.
i don't want to say goodbye.
sara, my arm. i'm stuck, honey.
he has a book.
no!
shit, i don't have her number.  she was never interviewed.  she took off right after the accident.
one more question. is this your husband's passport?
she told you that?  did she tell you about the $2,000 i'm still paying for the orthodontist? i'll bet she didn't mention that.
you upstart!
... it's not just from tonight.  i've known you for a long time.  i see you come out of work every day.  i walk with you to lunch.  i know what you order... i see you buy baby ruths before going back in...  i know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... i know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and i love you.   i love you.  i think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and i would be knocked out several times if i even got just a first kiss.  but i'll be back in the morning.  and i won't be distant.  and i will call if you let me... but i still don't drink coffee.
so you might be working for uncle sam.
you feelin' sick?
you sure have to hand it to those guys.
that floor has got to be very hard. is that better?
rita... i want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
thank you.  i believe she would have wanted it.
i don't know what you're talking about.
sheriff deeds' dead, honey--you just sheriff junior.
i guess if there's one lesson i've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  i forgot your question?
that's our case!
that's me.
i gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, marv.
i was on earth...
let me tell you what i know, daryl.  you went to saint xavier with mary.  you lived five blocks from her.  you liked her.  but she ain't interested.  that must've hurt, huh?
why not, mrs. bundy?
i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say except i'm sorry.
what are we talking about here?
oh, but it's not. if i hadn't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, i never would have took off for new york. i never would have met keaton, see. that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
we got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. i mean jesus christ, phil, that's too much. let's lose some of these guys.
what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that?
where you from with that crazy way of talking?
i know all about that. but i don't know how much to tell them.
you wanna score some go-fast?
that puts us right here... which means we can head straight for the sub arachnoid cavity.
winston found you.
yes, i know.
new record.
it's not just about me.  someone i saved died last night in a freak accident.  what if the others are in danger, too?
did it ever bother james bond?
when?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
you know, you've got a nasty reputation, mr. gittes. i like that.
whoa.  that's ok, dr. thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. i have sexual fantasies all the time too.
how could you call him?
some guys been looking for me, chick?  spanish kinda guys.
i know, vick.  i'm just not ready yet, okay?
what did she say?
oh. oh.
no.
fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of black vomit?
how is he?  still fighting crime?
i don't really feel like talking about it. the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow i doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
daddy, i want to discuss the prom with you. it's tomorrow night --
i grow closer to my target, your majesty.
probably hit by a car. hard to see things in the twilight.
i couldn't lose him.
faith, this is my mother.
just of getting hurt. they can't touch me inside.
woods.
look, either come in or stay out!
you don't tell us how to run our investigation.  you got that?
can he breathe under water?
no... i'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask i'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
hello, sir. it's david.
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
i haven't any hard feelings.
why don't you help me?
will you please call the chair people?
hey, look out, a bee!
i hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
lord.  you can imagine where it goes from here.
i know. i'm sorry...
the passionate one?
who's running the show, armitage? this a government sting?
i'll just take a minute.  deborah ann kaye.  you know what i'm talking about.  the case is going to trial. our chief witness is a dr. david gruber, you know who he is?
i know it is, brad -
i'm sorry about that, mr. stephens. would you like to try the fish?
oh, this afternoon. i thought i'd give the kids a treat.
certainly, sir.
i was hoping you'd be a little late, miss daniels.  you see, he hasn't arrived yet.
hello, hildy! what are you doing around here?
are they indeed? thank you.
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
third.  grandma did stunt work for pearl white.  i come from a picture family.  naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star.  so i had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. then the studio made a test.  well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  i went to a doctor and had it fixed.  they made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
well, i do commercials, sort of...
mom's home?...
ok.
what do you mean?
i know that. but please, mrs. robinson. this is difficult for me.
lieutenant lathe, i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. chasing across the universe to obtain what is, i am now certain, a bauble of fiction. tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? i would like nothing to remain.
k... cross.
you've done nothing but study swordplay?
i am eternally in your debt.
certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
that goes two ways.
well, i don't know. that depends.
batts's made. his whole crew is going to be looking for him. this is fucking bad.
lots of history.  for example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor sirens?
did she?
yes, that's true, but he refused to give the nazi salute. he kept his baton in his right hand. in hitler's presence. that was a brave act...
it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york, hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines, chillicothe and liverpool. by and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his yater.
there's nothing we can do. she had the key.
c'mon, start at the beginning.  you know these people?
thank you.
till she showed herself.
when?
yes, i am.
are you mad?
james.  don't leave just yet. there's something i think you ought to see.
i was devastated. of course.
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?
mr. gittes...  don't tell me how i feel.
oh, no. i wouldn't go ...
brain and lung.
who are you?  what the fuck do you want?
mr. president--
we've been attacked.
what will this prove?
really?!  you want tony clifton to headline harrah's tahoe??
her name is karen sumpter, from near dell city. just disappeared a couple weeks back. vanished.
where is...?
you see?  what's the lesson here?  <u>never</u> give up. <u>never</u> give up.
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
you got me.
the synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
this is your standard dart gun.
hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
okay.  shit, thelma!  what'd you do? i mean, what did you say?
what did he say?
oh, no, george, don't. it's full of romance, that old place. i'd like to live in it.
how 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
happy hunting.
hey! ethan!
listen: i don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  you are her, you are rheya.
three cents.
it's a convent.  all you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
no--i'm sorry. i merely saw him home. i'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. that's mcgann's job.
i met the guy at a party.  he said he wanted to do a biggie. he's new in town so i offered my services.
the stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
richard, victor thinks i'm leaving with him. haven't you told him?
he told us it's in the buick.
ah
marcus!  i did it!
if that's what you think is necessary.
uh, no. no, i ain't drunk.
you don't like me? you hate me?
you're welcome.
me.
i shared his cell!
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
what about you, wandering around alone? at least we have an alibi --
my neck, dog.  that's the last bag?
i don't care about the dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
we're taking that shark alive!
there's no rule!
i love to get pie after a movie.
i'm married, george.  me.  i can't believe it.  can you believe i'm married, george?
i don't know what i'm supposed say, mary. i want to do the right thing here.
...and half the other guys in this town. including you, i believe...
did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
map is kinda dirty, monster...
he's got the most beautiful eyes... the hell kind of question is that? he's a guy.
no, no.  that is where you are wrong. for us, it is cheap.  in medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  in miami, we sell for sixty.
once is enough, thank you.
i have. i did. it's done.
i want to work this.
this is the staff wing of the hotel. none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
do you hear me?
that's too bad, jeff. well, i guess i can't be lucky every day. forget i called.
so... now what?  cattle call again?
where?
you're not doing the extra credit problems.
that's 'bird.' emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
god.
i'm not losing the bet. it's just taking longer than i expected.
let's have you.
what's-her-name moved to buffalo.
turn that jungle music off.  we ain't in africa.
hey... you got a fine one right here!
okay.
how'd you know it was me?
my flesh and blood!
you said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
...no... mac... p-please...
yeah. he's a respected scholar. even no-am chomsky says he --
get the fuck out of here.
and how do we share--
there must be some good people... even in this time.
yes.
but how?
if you get a safe shot...
your mother's in here with us karras, would you like to leave a message? i'll see that she gets it.
no. they do. and it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... they respect you ...
they're not doing this, mulder.  i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi. when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. i felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. but it hasn't turned out that way. and now, if i were to be transferred to omaha, or wichita or some field office where i'm sure i could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. not after what i've seen and done.
of bodies.
okay, i'm here.  now why did you--
have you broken it yet?  we've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
okay. i was in texas dancing in an industrial show for sunkist oranges. they say i'm the new anita bryant. but i'm really a dancer from new york. a lot of credits. moderate talent.  anyway, after opening night, i was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. a tall texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. pure dynamite.
i liked it a lot. a lot of improvements. it just seemed overall, i don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
but yourself?  what about john brown?
that would seem to be the question of the hour.  i want to build it, doctor.  of course i'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as i said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. i need someone on the inside.
oh, that's such a delightful age.
don't let me down.
who's eddie?
same as you. ten thousand.
okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
who by?
hey.  have a nice time -- it's a good school.
navigational deflectors inoperative...!  directional control also inoperative, captain...!
what is your quest?
the jfk? in the rain!?
i like pigeons. you send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
what?
look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
i won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  never again...never....
god, mickey's such a hypochondriac. i wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
what kind of games?
forgive the butterfingers, buckaroo.  casper lindley, knight of the blue shield, at your disposal.  and my son, scooter.
yes, sir. they have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
i'm serious.
why are we stopping?
you sure?
i want a job, giles.
i'll sleep around a little.
[yeah, i've got to get used to the routes. i -- it won't happen again.]
tell me about patchett.
stop touching his brain!
who told you that?
what do you mean?  didn't you come back here for it?
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
about what?
what am i gonna do with flowers?
yeah. he's just a friend of mine i was trying to help, so... so what?
"little latin lupe lu."
this year?  that's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  i mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  so you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  and it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
not even close. hell, we can't even make syria or iraq.
mac, i have a favor to ask you. mac looks at taylor -
a dime.
what happened?
no, it isn't what i think.
eight-fifty.
ask what you can do for your country.  that kind of thing.
mm.  it doesn't take a genius.
wake up.
but your friends are my friends. my friends are your friends. i don't think it would work.  you have a little something on your upper lip.
some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now i'm supposed to be her baby's daddy.  anyway, i told your mom i wanted to be the one who told you.
naked girls, wild sex, video games. no wonder it's called "heaven."
and we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then george taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color i liked best!  and he said he loved me!
sure you don't want anything?
that's 'cause i <u>wasn't</u> there.
what?!
weird shit...?
king of the housecalls! master of the living room!
thanks, lou.
i never forget, honey.  i try, real hard. it's just, for some reason, i don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, i end up falling short.
i do. i'd just feel happier if you were with us.
maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out.
oh?
she answered our prayers.
why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
you tell me.  i'm new in town.
new course? you have no authority.  what's going on here?
i know you did, reverend. oh, i know how you tried!
who did this?
o.k. o.k.
good morning, louise.
copy that, continuing forward.  you just want me to get shots of everything, right?
you know, i've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
nicky, i did -
it's not like that.
no, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. i took care of it, dennis.
i'll only be a minute.
the creed cat, that's right. bastard's name was "church".  let me guess. your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
uh huh.  okay.
mike, at three and a half...
who are they?
oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about judge ramsey -- a little while ago --
i really think you're
wait--
what was the color of tim's belt?
marcus!
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
the late 20th century.
he touched your wallet!  where's your wallet?
...hell, i hope i've done the right thing.
no need to get up --
we are?
very professional.
it's just a scratch. you won't die. she turns away from him.
will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
walter.
hey, it's the general.
naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole.
the proof had his throat slit.  so far you're not denying it.
i had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
don't worry!!!?   you've got it!!? are you crazy?
don't raise your voice at--i gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
dad, we did something.  something to make it worse.
hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  that's the "machine." that is shelly "the machine" lev...
i'm pretty sure she did.
you know something about the human body, gray.
lemme have the bag.
i think you're just yellow.
no.  keep getting an answer- ing machine.
would you really, sam?
are you asking me if i’m gay for pay?
hello, jimmy.
yes.
i beg your pardon?
let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. at best, let's say i've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. to so many things i want to be for bill... funny business, a woman's career. the things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. you forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. that's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. without that, you're not woman. you're something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. the end.
i'm sorry, bill.
can you guess what i'm going to say next?
you please excuse...  i have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
why?
i haven't been sleeping. i haven't been clear or felt like myself. i'm in trouble. some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  but the tiredness -- boy...  not just sleepy.
blasé and epicene.
make yourself at home. don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. i won't be long.
may i say something, mr. president?
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him.
not yet.
i see...
walter. when i fill out my 302, do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
are we going to eat or what?
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  i knew about it, but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business.  not till now, that is.
i just paid out twenty. i'd like to get it back.
vampira!  you will come under my spell!  you will be my slave of love.
what kind of person do you have to be to do this?
where's your car? i'll walk you to it.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, nick. and it fucked up anna, and did something to domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. and i don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. and then the other. and then the other. it's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. at least it feels that way.
no! don't lay your hang-ups on me, vanessa. you're being very trippy.
rosa...
come again.
look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. may i make a suggestion?
it could've happened to anyone.
she didn't cone home last night.  we found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
looks like web mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
oh, kerry, this is monica.  monica, kerry.
yes, though i doubt he's involved in this.
it's inside the complex.
i'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  i haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
dude is bugging.  transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
but your life and lands are far from here.
and you were right about that ring. any other weddin' band would not do. but this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
that's not what i'm sug--
uh, excuse me, please. hello, rick.
stop!
what are you cooking?
how do we look?
the new york and rhode island assemblies have been dissolved...
you don't like brussel sprouts?
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? there must be something.
clyde wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. no wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
better make yourself comfortable. we got a three hour drive here.
not the compromised second draft. and then i, uh. . . ever hear of the seattle seven?
i have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
that right?... she used to be some looker.
they don't have to be in the office christmas show?
questions can amount to revelations. now, i’d hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal. do we?
what do you drink?
hello... ?
i can't say that i have.
i'm sorry honey, but...
afraid so.
what's its value today?
okay, so i just got things started.  but you could build on that.  you could keep it going.
good day, mister adams... george, what's the word from boston?
with all my clothes on!  the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  anything they said...
hey!
i haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? i hate you!
where do you --
the clothes are not important...
it's nothing. just a list -- it's not finished --
your suit is fitted desert fashion. who told you how to do that?
why?
funny jimmy.  you're so clean and you--this is silly.
eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "don quixote." so i'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  but i can't find the soundtrack --  i think i left it in malta.
yeah, we had them couriered over.  and listen, good work.  they're a great start. we're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
you got your room straightened out yet?
i am only a messenger. do you accept? you will be paid well.
dick, can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes?  we're on our way through to the basement - i promise we won't keep her very long.
did you ever have to use this thing?
oh, no, sir. i've never had a woman do that. i'm sure she drowned.
al, as far as you're concerned, i'm the don.
this fucking job's getting to you. you haven't written a fucking word since you started.
you could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
you don't know him very well, do you?
it's kind of late.
well, some say. it's not for you to worry about. another will be chosen.
when i'm guest of honor?
it's so nice to feel wanted.
careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
what they like?
okay, i promise i will.  just come here a minute, i want to show you something.
sorry, i get carried away. once i become interested in someone, i can't stop trying to figure them out...amnesia victims are challenging..
a lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
i'm sorry. where were we?
very appropriate.
you can't find it in racing forms, chick.
is that right?
...that's what's important.
when i found out you were going i just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... i'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
did you say group 7 access?
your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
now twenty seconds downrange...perfect tommy, how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn. true or false?
yes!  but i...i have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  it's whether we can live together... like this!  all the time.
i don't have to ask if you can feel that.
beg pardon, ma'am?
our pleasure, big dan.
you're the asshole, buddy.
isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
england went out with a stress fracture.  that puts you in charge, lieutenant.
oh, come on!  you have made millions off the story of her murder.  you're obsessed with her and you're obsessed with her daughter!
well, thank you...?
for a minute, doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong.
of course.
what's wrong?!
you gave me what?! knots! you gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
me and simone.  what i did.
well... goodnight.
um...now is not a good time, okay. detective jackson's hurt.  he's fine. i've got a fire marshall shot, detective jackson is hurt but not seriously.
hey, mikey!
in maine?
well that's lovely talk, that is. and another thing, why aren't you at school?
it's a thuggee ceremony. they're worshipping kali, the goddess of death and destruction.
... detective ich-iro matsu-moto. hey, we're getting mr. moto on our side.
yeah.
the only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the royal kraal, at ulundi.
all his life.  he's tried everything.
what'd he say?
...you need to talk to me.
--and why does he hang out with his friends? because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. it's called loyalty!
you don't know what it's like out there.  walking around like some kind of circus freak.  people staring, whispering --
and don't give me this shit, 'i was a lawyer, too.' 'cause i know who you were. you couldn't hack it as a lawyer. you were bag man for the boys and you still are. i know who you are.
yeah, i catch your hacks.  he's satan's lap dog, or something.
that's why i'm crying.
what?
i could check your prostate.
go!
is she asian?
a willie o'keefe?
i'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
did you take it from the street in front of your work?
wow...you clean up nice.
let's forget that we ever met.
happy anniversary, mrs. gooding.
the fax machines.
are they gonna hurt us, walter?
gee.
starling.
you got bank americard?
why not tell us what you have heard? hmm?  how much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
i don't make no bones about where i'm going to spend eternity. i have always been wild and you know that. if you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
...you hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
this signal's weird...must be some interference or something. there's movement all over the place...
i'll go.
you want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
yes
this wire came while you were gone. your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
state your case, mr. prosecutor.
wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
yeah?
i think maybe i'll bring him back next week ...
you disappoint me.  i thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
as of now, they don't see any relation. but they're checking it out. the state, special task force, fbi--they're all here. they'll find the guy.
at home.
i put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  which is?
i reckon i'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
you can't make it your life's work looking for jacqueline.  ) you'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. i hope you'll let me help you.
where is he?
are you going to let erik wake the gods?
what's wrong, you don't like steak?
sonny-boy, one word?
dinner?  again?
well, here's where the fun never stops!
how could you do this to me?
and the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. despite who he is and what he does for a living. we're always saying we want to take control of our lives. you don't want to take control. you want to lose control. jesus knows it.
gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
sweetie, they're almost ready.
no, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
he said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
operator...how much would the call be station-to-station?...thirty-five cents cheaper?...i'd still be short twenty cents ...just a second, operator...  colonel, shoot the lock off the coke machine.  there's bound to be enough change in there.
dad!
that's what i wanna hear.
you pull up -- collect your first installment.  then you let the daughter go.  when she reaches me, i'll dump out another third.  same action.  i back up again -- you pull forward.  satisfy yourself it's there.  then we do it one last time.  the final exchange. and we go our separate ways.
this isn't a death sentence.  greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  i'll garden.  i'll write.
no, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
it's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
you know we have to let kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. she'll love it.
c'mon, c'mon, that's it...
same thing, daddy. mommy says --
maroon?  whaddaya want?
larry...

big threat. tv would ream you.
debi rutlege.  female.  caucasian. twenty four.  worked over at the four oaks hotel.
well, it's good that you're there.
i don't know.
well, there goes our record deal.
no.
hey, lou.
yes, father. yes! so much for my vow of chastity. what did it matter? good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? had goodness made me a good composer? i realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. and i was nothing to god.
i'm so glad you're here louis... i've dreamed of your coming...
what are you doing... ?
what?
affirmative, admiral.
... how could i what?
you think you can learn, mccall?
aside from the fact that mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
thrr...
dead end--it's a clone.  what about the mustang?
what now?  where is she?
so?
don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
well, how was it?
are you serious?
an extra heel of bread.  please take it, you need your strength.  you've been working so hard.
buddy, i don't know if that's such a good idea.
yeah. so why you look do down?
what happened? you okay?
i was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
a shadow.  what's as big a castle?  as light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  the shadow of the castle.  are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
elle, i can't. you don't understand.
do you watch the news?  read the paper.  last week, this whole place was underwater.
max!  what's wrong?
mr. arkady, honest, i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. so now i don't have a cent to my name. i can't even get my car out of the garage.  i tell you, mister...  if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car out of this garage, see?  the bus depot here has a western union thing.  and of course i'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
i'm sorry to hear about that, sir. his face contorted in rage.
exactly.
isn't this technically a scooter?
where do we go from here?
and where are they going with it?
then to the bastille.
just some guy... they found.
well, uh... i'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
ladies and gentlemen...
calf love. i loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
hello. thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
is that the best you've got?
good.
good night, kids. don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
debo!  debo!
takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. just begun to understand it myse1f. give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. besides i can't let you take my wand. only have the one, what would i do? i'd be helpless. it's out of the question.
he leaves you smoking...
oh, it just ended, then.
if i knew i wouldn't have to ask. what did you do? i was happy the way it was.
no.
is that all right with you?
yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. and your mom knew how to work an audience.
he saw her at the northern care...
now i am.
do you?
pretty good speech, maggie.
what are you doing?
did you ever see francis-8?
yes, thank you, sir.
i thought we should celebrate.
yes.  he admitted it.
it probably will.  in fact, i'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  why should i settle for that?
how many came?
what's he so excited about?
i'm not hanged yet.
no.
what?
one, two, three... 
i didn't <u>know</u> we were <u>going</u> to be married.
after this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and i are going away.  just the two of us.  no dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. just you and me.
should be here any minute.
it's not a very big army. and small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. we've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
so did this one. wambli is a rare and sacred creature. when someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. we share everything. a lot of power in the eagle feathers. but you think that's bullshit too, don't --
like a psychiatrist?
can you swim?
jackie?
are you busy tonight?
strange.
no, but i'm goddamn thirsty. ice water?
shut up, fred.
nick! nick, you'll kill him!... easy. nick, easy! hey, hey. vince goes back a long way.
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. here all eyes gaze on us.
it's okay with me, hi kevin.
get outside and watch her house. if you see anything funny call me.
i don't know.  he is the stronger one.  he has a power--
continue.
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight.
what if someone finds out?
well i'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
he won't let us go. he's going to kill us.
i want you to give up that terrible job.
fuck 'em.  they don't know what they're missing.
yeah.
a little place with cabins. the something-motor inn. i haven't checked in yet.
so... why can't jason get a fair trial?
i may have, as... as i said, i simply don't remember.
big girls don't cry-i-eye.
but meant her moving here.
what a zoo!
but these, like, white supremacists trashed my office, last week.
you don't understand. this is an emergency. let me talk to anyone.
well, i thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
that tip not work-out for you fellas?
i thought you weren't coming.
the first time, when they attacked long ago, was the beast here?
this? this is a joke.  i'll give your group a thousand bucks.
will we always leave it at this?
oh, baby, what's going on?
but everybody is all right.
no, never!
you sure? that doesn't sound --
cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ain't back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
it looks like white's game.
xxxxxx
i can't get power, sir!
how about this one?
but no short-arm inspection. i'm with you there.
how come you’re alive? child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  what am i really looking at here, huh?  are you really not just a lousy private eye? am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
if you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  that is where they should be.  now put foundations under them.
you saw it all didn't you?
hey.
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
it's just for a little while, sam. the baby-sitter wasn't there.
brother and sister no more.
what's happening up here?
what?
oh my god.
oh, yes.
how come terrance and phillip are so weird looking?
i never read the paper.
well i just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
and are the police sure about that?
oh, that explains everything.
where is he?.
i got your boy killed.
what i need this for?
that's funny - i never slept better.  and i had the most wonderful dream.  i was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and i was the crew - i kept a lookout for icebergs, and i sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when i woke up, i felt like swimming right back to you.
this is only a vaudeville.
don't blow it, elliot. he's bluffin'. he just told you so himself.
please —- i can't explain things like this to your right ear.
i've been here before, when i was a kid. my old man was in the service, we used to live on the army base in hamburg.
for my life? at a discussion group? i think not.
jts...?
i dunno.
the reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
no, no way, i couldn't take that...
what?
josé yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  he's grabbed gina.
i always wanted to travel.  i just never got the opportunity.
why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  ever been booked before?
what are you doing here?
come on, joe.
i'll never forget you said it.
...got no day, got no date.  probably ain't worth a duck's fart . this one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. no sir i'll stick with this .
what's the matter?
how do i know you don't want to blow up a factory?
yeah ...
fuck that, helmuth. you want to discuss symbols here?  this guy was a front man. he was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  i'm not interested in small fish, i'm after moby dick. come on, helmuth. hard facts.
what was that?
i don't know. i'm still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog.
you want to go for a ride?
off the record. no cameras.
you don't like public enemy?  it's the dope shit.
call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. it's friday anyway... and hot.
i saw him. just before those bastards zapped him back. the adm is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of chateau margaux.
...do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
stop calling me david. we're on set, for christ's sake, you don't have to call me david here.
uh -- what are they?
don't get out of the car.
it's alright. this is the only place i can find some peace.
deck ten.
what's that?
oh, is that it!
...what do you do?
i can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  goodnight, honey. don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
i don't know anymore. i thought i was, but obviously i was wrong.
...who let you in?
cora, i adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in england...  i am certain of that. more than ever before.  i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
no.
heard you done the roof yourself.
no -- but i will ask.
millions upon millions upon millions! the cards. the stock!  the clothes! the toothpaste!  the guy was on the level!  and you blew it!  a man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! and what do you do?!
you back that queen again, you son of a bitch, i'll blow you right out of that chair!  somethin' on your mind?
how can that be?
okay.

which is guy-speak for...
i just talked to her on monday. we still hang out on weekends.

what did i tell you?
come on. clean that counter off brad. let's go. play ball.
and if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then brooke windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. which would mean that you would've had to have found mrs. windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. isn't that right?
please excuse me a moment, jeffrey, and i'll get to the dishes.
is it dry?
i need you to stake me.
where!
and not just killed, sid. we're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.

faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... we have ogg's gifts, the key and the --

mrs. dreyfuss, can i borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
huh.
yessss!  ah, ha, ha, ha...
i do.
i think your life's about to change.
...and is that serious?
that's going to be fun.
no client has ever seen my face, and i intend to keep it that way.  besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, i don't wanna be there for it.
yes, i am.
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself!
got something to say to me, nick?
i'm leaving in the morning.
hector.  the big one has no sense of humor.  and since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
thank you.
first you gotta tell me something.
napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the directory in paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a roman conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of italy.  only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the directory from replacing him.
...well bart, which is it? orphan? dame?
maybe i oughtta get there a little early. for good luck.
why you left.
no, they didn't say --
you're not wearing a belt.
open it.
counselor.
well, if it isn't the fabulous baker boys!
don't talk like that!
listen, i'll never make it.  i'll have to go to the toilet.
the money's right here! get the key!
rachel, i've got an expl-- i've got an explanation.
status?
its like. but it gets boring. it's boring.
like what?
can i help pump the gas?
don't call me that.
have you been to  let's see -- santiago, chile?
what're you hanging around with a guy like that for? you were in the movies, right? a stuntman? what's he ever done he can talk about? you feel okay?
it was before you started going out. we had lunch at that inn on the lake.
ma!  stop! what do you want me to do?
they were taking you away.
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
don't shoot, sir. i can deal with this.  ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. see, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. and it's not that i like you or anything, but i've kinda gotten used to having you around.
just checking up on your family.  i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
yes.  isn't it there?
deck five.
what time are visiting hours?
the tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
sure.
i can't understand a thing like this. it's something you almost never see.
by the way, jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and i'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. got it?
well, that's just how stupid i am. when you go riding, it will be with me. and if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
yeah?
pakistani. okay? we're from pakistan.
we should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
propaganda. we've been had.
what's in here then, lead?
it's not going to be forever. i figure three years is long enough. i can see it the music pans out.  and right after graduation we should start seeing other people. kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. know what i mean?
"take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
yessir.
may we have the rings please?
he was...my responsibility--my rio.
why are we leaving?
what the hell are you laughing about?
i know what i saw.
anyway... i did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  i did all that shit for a long time.
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
i haven't changed my mind, westley, i want you to understand that! i don't like you! i never have!  i never will! that's clear enough, isn't it?
not when i'm with you, ted.
of course. only i'm afraid you'll be cheated. there isn't much of a view of the procession here.
i thought you'd forgotten about me.
if you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from new england to the south.  it was actually the first railroad through new york city.
what did he say?
come and tell me it's over and i'll walk away, jimmy.  i've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- i'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
i didn't sleep well.
you never told us you grew up on a farm.
even if money wasn't an issue, dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
want to hear my philosophy? do it to him before he does it to you.
i'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
you shouldn't have talked to norbert that way.
oh my god. can you believe your ears?
yes, that would certainly do...
well --
i wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
this is fat sam, and this is gummy. 
... spock...
the honey trap.  and there's the honey.
yeah, i still read a lot.  they bring me stuff.
"miss susan alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new chicago opera house in a performance of - of -"  i can't pronounce that name, mr. kane.
jackson was from west fork, tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson.
no.  i had guns all my life.  i used to go turtle shooting.
listen, raymond, a year ago, dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. in his statement, glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
how?
ha!
i don't know what to say about it, walter.  it was a form of temporary insanity.  but i had to tell you about it because --
...you take that anacott steel?
what a lovely room you have here.
you feel sorry for solaris, or for me?
the peace conference.
yes, the first one's fine. heathrow direct.
hmm?  oh, the knifes?  they're just props.  nice, aren't they?
"back end" ... count on it.
the club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  i want to try someplace different.
i don't want to be up there all alone, mama.... i want to be with you.
by red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, colonel?
when this is over we should bury the hatchet. celebrate. a champagne dinner?
it means i'm through with boxing. i'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. i'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
but there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
you mean -- she didn't like sex?
molly, dear molly. go to bed now, baby...
shut the fuck up, donny.  we'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. we'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  million fucking clams. and yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  our fucking troubles are over, dude.
yep. and while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? osso buco?...
yes.
no, sir, none at all.
well, my father left us when i was five-years old. he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew... let's get back to brown & williamson. if you decide to go on "60 minutes," i got to know everything about why you got fired.
no, it's your life. but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
-- mmm --
sunlight... it destroys him.
that's not the point.  in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
...that's all well and good, captain, save for one thing:  there's no gold down there.
wow, a treasure map! what's the treasure?
right, i'll get your door. i tend to fade in and out lately.
they cost fifty pounds each!
what if someone else buys it in the meantime?
suppose not.
i can't...
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
good morning, wanda.  hi, hartley.
i never asked you!
he's going down.
you do...?
collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do i do if he smells the trap.
shelly...!
on what?
kind of a bad neighborhood, snake.
you sure you've done this before?
yeah, you want to watch it.
the pitch, high heater. bucky knows what's coming. he steps in, smash, over the green monster.
was.  i'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  you got anything for me?
i know, but she did. she's with someone else now...
it's not worth it, tom. he's surrendering.
you sew very badly.
what about this nunheim?
no thanks, i must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
back the tape up. i need it again! let it roll! just as high as the fucker can go! and when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, i want you to throw that fucking radio into the tub with me!
boy, you must be pissed.
no.
the show must … you know
must be somebody?
i'm serious.  you don't -
god. i know where they should have a commune for you. they should have a commune for you at bellevue.
i don't understand.
franky can't make it. he had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. i'm mickey morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
hurry back, please.  i'm sleepy.
no.
do you think you can sing it?
no.
gosh, you look pretty tonight.
29 years...?
no.  not after that night.  i don't know what happened.  maybe he caught her with some john... all i know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... indian kid named davy.  used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. him and suzie were at the glades that night.  it was right after that, ray got suzie busted and sent her away.  that's what there is to say about ray duquette.
we planned a trip for her. i was going to send her to bermuda.
it's right under that pile.
why didn't you tell me?
she's really sick you know.  don't you know what she's doing?  she knows i went to berkeley.  she knows i knew noah.  she makes up that story about me.  she's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
then what does he want with you?
how long ago was your makeover?
not funny, huh?
give me a break! what happened?
you've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. that's not our betty...
...no...
but i came here to learn about america.
thing is, i'm about out of fuel.
fine, and how are you?
sorry, my brother.
absolutely.
ah! so you admit there is someone!
dubious but special honor, tom -- crewing dickie's boat. alright, bar's open.
c'mon seymour, i'm trying to collect data here! don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
bill, this brenda's randy flagg's niece. we need to find grant yesterday! the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
want to be a high climber now, do you?
this is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? the rest of this is all .30 caliber--
as far as you're concerned, susan, i've never wanted anything -  i don't want anything now - except what you want.
now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end. that's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. but she, also, could not have kept her promise. and...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. so instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
god, where the hell did you come from?  you scared me to death.
thank you very much, your excellency.
rosanna guerrero.
elliot.
if i could make you understand.  if you could just be made to see it the way i do.  the way it's going to be.
nobody but you can do that to me. i don't know why.
maybe i should put on the training whe---
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president?
refresh my memory.
lee, what the hell are you doing?
fine. how was the match? did you loose?
they're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  they'd be better off letting it move on.
definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
they got a saloon there?
yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. if you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the creeper. just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
we'll be able to start this afternoon.  i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  now, that'll impress the governor.
how d'you reckon that one out?
that's a lie!!
what's gotten into you, baxter?
liar!
thank you so much.
what about the progressives with the high jackpots? where are they? these machines are hidden.
nobody's telling them to hate you --
i don't really feel like talking anymore.
yes, i know.
really?
no, dewey. you'll ruin the whole night.
cut it back a little bit.
you've nothing to fear, kringelein
have you never been caught in a similar situation?
thank you.  so, since i have a few more days of vacation left, i was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  i mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
of course. of course. of course he does. of course. thank you. thanks.
do you know what the little people just told me?
harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. this bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
nothing's happening!
friend. baseball bat.
i hear six.
what the hell's going on?
i'm not a theater checker. i'm a call girl.
so...i guess i'll see you around.
you have something, dr. weir?
name's danny mccoy.  no neck mccoy we called him.  runs a few protection rackets for carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  me and danny been friends since we were six. take a good look at that face, floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  you understand what i'm sayin'?
that's not what i mean.
glad to meet you, too.  you are all your father talks about.
oh, i'm sorry, trip. what you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. no offense.
i need to talk.
you look swell in that three—alarm number --
where's your mama?
no, he's not bothering anyone. let him stay up here.
until guy tells them to go. once they watched me for like two hours. i found my car the next day in the t.j. maxx parking lot.
me neither, but the upshot is i've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it doesn't look good.
he's not glowing.
but now you're telling us now you do.
monsieur andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
my parents are having friends from college over. they're really nice... they have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
well... she's an extremely jealous person. i didn't want her to find out about the girl.
kristen, don't start with me.  you know what your shrink said...
wait a minute!  what am i worried about?  otho, you can't even change a tire!
well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...it's called "chicks with dicks".
i want to leave fast.
yeah.
oh, the record company sent these...
hey, i though you guys were coming to the show, man?
see what??
there are cables overhead.  hang on.  it'll clear up.
yes.
yeeees?
good idea... kill me.
hey there, nickie.
i refuse to turn out like them. twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. they let the boys control their lives. not me.
what was that about?
why?
the cops?  the cops read my column to know who to bust.  we're the only watchdog the public has.  none of this is going away.  we'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  until you slip up.  and you will.  you are looking at your shadow.  because all these elaborate precautions with simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
well, consider the source. i don't even know what a lady is.
what are these movies? 'amazombies', 'space psychos' 'creatures from thesan andreas fault'?
oh.  well, i hate you and everyone who looks like you.
it's a very good job--too good to pass up.  i'll be handling funding for the whole...  look, i...  ..."like" you a lot.  and you...  ..."like" me, okay?  maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
thanks for everything.
do you walk home?
that sounds like me.
you know what it's like, agent kujan, to know you'll never be good? not good like you. you got good all fucked around. i mean a stand up guy. i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything 'cause i was a cripple. shit, i wasn't
shoot pool, fast eddie.
pretty country.
you're damn right i'm serious....
that's not what it's about, brian. the point is there was a kid in there. and what if there'd been two? i went in because that's what i do. it's my way. it's dad's way. it isn't everybody's way.
turn around.
nothing. i felt sad, i put myself on the circuit. it was a mistake.
give me your wrist.
what the hell was that?
why did he go to see mary rooney?
i wanna do a small buy first.  ten thousand.  we'll see how it goes.
got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
i don't... i... i can't remember...
to a five-year-old kid? what a scumbag!
the way you were looking at me, i just went.
just let me know when you are going out and where --
go.
screw your boundaries, janie.  you have something i want.
he just had two.
oh no. he said that.
shut down?
shit!  shit!  shit!
if you don't mind driving, i'd like to take you as my guest.  there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
what...?  why?
wow... you just gave me goosebumps, you know that? you make it all sound so real. great improv...
have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
do you mean that?
she laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... she said she wanted to be friends.
a little?
what do you think?
sit down.
i'm so glad you could come, mr.--
--there had to be a white house overseer--
i've got all this back pay coming.  why don't you let me get you a place in town?
i only met him once, but that was enough.  for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  he offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  he claims to have some sort of factory in texas, i believe. said i could have the run of the place.  he had all sorts of specifications.  but when i questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  it's sad.  so few men do.
how could i not?
no one's ever caught a great white except indirectly in fishing nets. i want to dart it and keep it alive.
aramis... these are... these are whores!
when's your deadline?
like who?
i won't forget.  when are you coming up here to see your mother?
i won't.
turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
like learning arabic?  you're gonna learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
ok, so we have a...presence.  what do we do about it?
you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
my, my... ah, who are you?
here. 23rd street subway station. where we first found the fish. with a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
she told me.
don't worry, it's totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
i don't know, maybe we missed her.
a treaty?  don't be ridiculous. what treaty is this?  who made it? who has been giving orders?
...walk?
is your name paul benjamin?
no, you've done a perfect job.
hey, that's the guy-
miss sellers, do you know dr. alan paley?
i mean, i'm having a good time with you...
keep still, constable.  you were half-drowned when they found you.
yeah?
i admire your strength.
christ...  where the hell is the bathroom?
gee, i don't know. i guess i'm not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
bully? are we talking about gary boyd? or your dad.
what's the problem?
general mann -- i was told to expect you, sir.  i'm colonel heffner.
i think i've had one.
do you feel alone right now?
it's tommy's. the sucker owed me a favor.
i wasn't gonna --
let's head for texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
listen, you fuckin' yokel, i've had it with you. i've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since i got here. get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
if you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
what's up?
we get to mexico, we can have a life.
good. you're just what i need right now.
naturally.  you're going to become a partner in a big institution. it's one of the largest in the world.
found what?
what do you mean?
we'll pass around cigars....
ironic, isn't it?
mad! darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. i love you for some of them - and in spite of others. i haven't let those become too important to me. they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. all right. but you will not sharpen them on me - or on eve...
what's wrong, danny?
anything.
it's not gonna hurt you.
hoity-toity!  john best, what's the matter here?
as it happens, i'm headed for frisco myself.
you're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  so stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
please continue, sergeant.
i'm sure, simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... but when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
basically you'd have to re-write the victim's dna, alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
hold your pantyhose.  here, gimme a hand.
you happy?
she went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
why?  because i don't give up all my secrets?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...city council...?  what's the trouble...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
maybe they never got here. he could have taken her anywhere.
you must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
what's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
yes, dad.
kind of.  hey, look - john seale, oliver stapelton, darius khonji - they're friends.  and great dp's i could give them a call for you.
would you pose for me for free?
jess?
what do we do now?
c'mon, rocky. i'm twelve.
cindy, let me...
how do you think i got here?
same way you did.  through that gate.
really, i don't want to.
well, i'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't i?
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
may i go to the cinema?
so you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? a water gun.
i know where we could get the money. a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
i suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
frank.  we gotta go back.  frank...
no. you're not.
when did you build this?
and the hell everybody else, right?
any messages, carmen?
over the gold.
should you see a doctor?
far out.  where are my glasses?
that chart i drew up'll get you past the reefs.  if you're steersman's good enough, that is.
why?
'mr. stanwyk, of provo, utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
it falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
what are they?
you know, i was talking with your father before...and i was telling him that  it's ironic.  i-i used to always have thanksgiving with hannah...and i never thought  that i could love anybody else.  and here it is, years later and i'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  the heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  it really is.  i...  it'd made a great story, i think. a guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  it's, you know, it's a...
ruby... this guy almost took out an entire tactical response team. you can't expect me to just leave you --
it's some psycho killer groupie. i got an anonymous letter that says she killed bobby vomit, johnny crunch, and now, this society dame.
i'm not staying in my room, uncle charles.
you're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
just a half-a-cup.  hello, dottie. i'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
first you've got her buying your file.  now you've got her killing nilsen.  forget her, willya?  go someplace.  sit in the sun.  get away from this goddamn fog.  get her out of your system.
who's the stiff?
i'm half irish.
they don't want the classic horror films anymore.  today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
what happened?
as the man said, it's in my nature.
where's maggie? where'd ya take her.
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior.
a hundred dollars? i wouldn't call that cheap. and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
fifteen thousand.
no, junior, you shouldn't touch her.
...fishin'.
don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
-- you could have scared the son of a bitch off. we may never bust him now. all for a couple's political points.
okay, sometimes i'm a nineteen.
so, he put aside some jewelry for me. a lot of jewelry.
hello?
thanks.
sabotage?
oh thomas, a pair of pippins! as round and rare as golden apples!
lynn!
deceased.

front page?
this can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. we have reason to believe it was the youngest brother richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
i can see why they sent you along.
like the last time.
relax, mulvihill, glad to see you.  do you know claude mulvihill here?
the one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
on account of mitch?
admiral! there be whales here!
we took them home alla way out in brooklyn. her name was mary feeney. what do you say? you think i oughta give her a ring? i'll take the skinny one.
no.  yes, i want to know what for. but i don't want to ask.
well, i'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
that's a terrible idea-
trade. okay. the photographs... for a straight answer.  who are you? and how do you know zephram?
who?
you heard anything yet?
ogilvie and oglethorpe.
i have an anniversary coming up, thought i'd buy her something special.
so what do you think, can i crash at your place tonight?
and we didn't have to bring another present?
what do i do?
you and your touchy investors.
you're eighteen.  you don't know what you want.  you won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
how could you vouch for me? that's...  ... arrogant presumption -
all right, what do you need.
it's artificial?
but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
ha! who told you about the stardust ballroom?
i'm not sure i agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, lou.
yes.
shall i be forced to feed you, mr. kessler?
very early in the morning.
cornelius..
an' how you do it?  how you rift cuss?
you get it straightened out?
the money, the gear!
he was my blood -- and i demand to know what happened to him.
had it done in singapore. bunch of us drunk as coots --
i went to school with a guy named price. but that was in boston. you're from cleveland, aren't you.
i do. i want to very badly.
the room has sound sensors. if you wake it up, it breathes fire.
so you left her?  just like that?
that!?!
that's what the game's all about.
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life.
you had it all figured out.  you move into my house.  you raise my kids.  you sleep with my wife.  it was a good plan, arnie.
look at them ugly suckers, blue. one sheet of glass between them and us.
i'm having the floor fixed,
i think you're right.
be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  this girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
not much to tell.  i went to public school.  went to university on scholarship.  went to work for an investment firm. in eight years i owned it.  my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after.  i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. one of the pieces was him.
it -- it doesn't matter, mother!  he is dead now!  dead!
you motherfucker.
i ain't seen him in a couple of years.
you bought this for me?
tis a fair question.  if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
what do you want with my dad?
it was pulsing on your sat frequencies.
she believed you?
look, i don't really remember how this thing works.
oh. it looks like a hearse.  very nice. compact.
-- but everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. i know you think you're god's gift to waitresses, but...
he was there, tatum.
i don't know. i don't remember doing it.
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
how long you been coming here?
second thing that comes to your mind.
we're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  we would give you a promissory note...
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
it's all better left unsaid, grace.
i dunno what i'd do with your help. i've gotta take her out of there ..
nothing.
get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
tina, it's dawnie. i'm  on my way. cici follows her back into the living room.
colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow...
how's your love life, midge?
actually, i'm free sunday.
oh! huh. exactly how do we do that?
are you sure?
all television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
the chinese close in five minutes. beef lo mein. it's  been on my mind since i woke. whatjathink?
you bet. how much is that worth?
not yet.
actually, i'm lookin' for marietta's daughter, lula. her and 'er beau took off the other day. marietta's real upset about it.
dorothy. no!
i took her out a couple of summers back.  scared the hell out of some cows.  -- i wonder if she'd make it down to antarctica.
thank you, ma'am.
is it me? is it my fault?
if she comes over here, max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
i do love a good check mate.
it was the year of the rhizopus rot. grandpa almost lost the farm. you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
came looking for a job with a friend of hers. pretty girl. could've been her sister.
it doesn't pay very much, but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months... do you think that's too soon? i'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
...insulting people who were in the camps. ...what's the point?
what's that?
here's my proposition, mr. nugent.
i think i saw you leavin' by the front door just as i was coming in the back.
fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. teachers, students, staff, janitors...
you'll take care of that.
oh i don't know, i think the tests work pretty well. sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
hi, ben. what are you doing with yourself these days?
wrong day?
do you know what happened yesterday, carter?  i was officially nominated for the commissioner's post for the lapd. there was a dinner last night, two hundred lapd officers were there.
okay.  so what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
good evening, mrs. rand.
give me a first rough course as soon as you can, lieutenant ballmuff.
zero body count.
maybe after the holidays then.
let thy soul be healed
the village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost sankara stones...
really? what do you feel?
you lied. where is your tribe?
i don't think you trust anybody, do you?
miss parsons, i have one additional question for you.
he's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6.
come one, that was so weird.
i can't quit and leave you alone. i can't quit until you quit. ma would've wanted it that way.
you'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
but it won't be christmas tomorrow.
uh-huh.
please!
i gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
josh proposed!
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
they still around, your folks?
say!...what happened to your blanket? lose it?
listen to me, bain.  two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell. you don't know how they got the information.  it bothered you, but you didn't care.  how do i know this?  because ten years ago, i was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
tony clifton.
you know, all this nightmare we went through with hearst. the whole thing... and in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
you've grown, big program.
i'm sorry, d'amour...
right home after.
if that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
doing what?
half the house! you'll never see a penny. i want it here, in my hand.
come on.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  which means safe, something i'd wear.
...why did he come back?  why did the boy turn back...?
we're alive!
that's a joke, right?
what is this?  don't be stupid man...
alright, i gave him the case? .. so the case is closed, so what?
pretty incredible, isn’t it?
what're you gonna do with morse code?
hold on, ramon! is there time to make another trip?
this isn't happening...
"speaking"!  reeking, seeking, creaking... freaking!
you make the plate?
why don't you want to talk about it?
well, you've got to go easy. we haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
pow?
so anyway, that's the nightmare i've been having lately.
what am i injecting you with?
he's not giving up?
but the police --
luther, say again.
one.
you need to say a bit more than that!
well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but i'm sure it's over by now. he should be checking in any moment --
all right...but keep your eye on me, boy...i'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...if you don't hear me first time i holler, you better read my mind...i don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
anna koros. she sensually extends her hand, warren shakes it -
let's do it.
yo --
mister. i'm begging, 'kay? i'm begging. this is not some card club, 'kay? this is the tomahawk. we're an international gaming destination. we're in guidebooks. you can't do this... you can't do this to me...
so. i got a question. just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. we call the coastguard.  coastguard shows up. what exactly is the plan?
who's got him?
yeah, i'll do you a favour.
jen, listen ...
and if they don't.? what will happen to spock?
right.  now who is the person in california?  the connection?
good morning, girls.
yes, an invitation. i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but mr. benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  isn't that right, mr. benjamin?
which way?
an apprentice for thirty years.  we've noticed your people's mental discipline. did that develop here?
charlie, you're just excited.  you don't realize -
and yet his son is a fucking dunce.
orvolle. his wine.  from now on, nothing but water at every meal --
you're hurt...
and who is she? does she work in catania?
...very good.
i understand.
you'll live.
you said --
so it was recently that you tried this.
i just wanta wash my hand. it's got blood where i hurt it.
eddie?...  you owe me money!
i was there.
jack?
what's your mother doing this afternoon?
i smoke more these days. i smoke more when i'm unhappy.
i'd prefer you to say what you feel.
and this is your "work"?
jack?
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach.
you run all over town, don't you, travis?
marion. it's a book.
so much pain.
hence the radiation.
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
when's school over?
you look like robinson after that last lamotta fight.  'course lamotta looked a lot worse.  so you're twenty-two, right?
ha...
i see. are you unhappy at our little company?
so here is my candidate. what do you think?
not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
pretty good, huh? i taught them everything they do.
no, just so i can see ya, ya know. don't have to turn my neck.
good. i fucking hate australians.
i'm tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
well, there he sits.  it's not supposed to make sense.
i was! and all i get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
but the wardrobe women have got one. and next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
it's just something i had.  you know
what?
it would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
what's up? jess ready?
hold this. 
you look way pretty, kim.
you're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. i said i'd tell you everything i know. you and your friends behind the mirror.
... that's perfectly all right.
yeah. you, too? oh, joe . . . oh, i'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
you've been a busy little beaver. especially with that records mess up in church hill.  your notes are very complete. naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  in fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
objection.
i can't hold out on you any longer. lamb bites wolf.  beautiful.
son of a bitch!
what?
what's his story?
oh yea -- there has never been a better time for something new.
wiz?
you've got a smart man, mrs. stone. hang onto him.
hello, express. what's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
yes!  yes!  now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
where's della? bring her here?
in the good old days, the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
i want to help you.
and them fingers, them chubby fingers. and that stroke. it's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
oh no.
what was it called, sir.
we're not gonna have pie and punch!
what's your favorite scary movie?
oh, joy.
during the day? we'll go for a drive or something.
guess.
where?
thank you.

he doesn't give a damn about me.
what'd you do?
last thing i want is you with a gun.
and don't call me buddy! out of here! out!
try sitting down.
i need help with her.
i think you're very sweet, corrado.
patrizia, don't start in again... i would rather be called depraved. unless you happen to love children.
you don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
all i've heard, from the day i met michael, is julianne this, and julianne that...
you are so completely unbalanced.
sounds like professional jealousy.
hillary mitchell? how's she?
look, can i just borrow your car?!  i promise it’ll be returned!
who's that?
society is falling apart, miss farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. you see, i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry, and i can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can i?
it's not. you're money. any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
do me a favor. think about it. is that too much too ask?
jeff wigand, michael moore.
how do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
god, i don't know what it was called. i never saw it. i only got twenty- five bucks for the whole goddamned thing.
right now?  never let another writer read your stuff.  he may steal it.
win?
al.
better than i can!
secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
... we're prisoners, mr. gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
will they attack?
could we sail to venice?
i'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  you want to come with me?
we did it.
okay... but i would like to know about the other cadets. what they were like -- nice guys?
what?! we follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
of course not. they're possibles. i've checked them against bureau records, check them against your file. how did you get it?
you got a girl-friend?
this room has not been used for a long time.
what else can i think after a tale like that?  good heavens, bob, things like that don't happen today. we're living in the twentieth century.
think about it...long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
because... well, i know i can trust you.
do i knock or something?
i'm an airline pilot.  ah, clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies.
this happened to you?
and i have mine.
i got one of those too.
the guy who bought you that ring.
wait a minute. where's your uniform?
what for?
what?
we should abort.
that's bullshit and you know it! you built this fucking ship and all i've heard from you is bullshit!
what's the problem?
wade's in cryo-prison.
huh?  oh. they said i was crazy. said i wanted to run it like a grocery store.
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals.

i'll settle for a pardon. you gotta drill?
what are you <u>doing</u> here?
are you sure you're okay?
they are washed.
no, i've got it.
what's her name?
central pumping.  all the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
got divorced, i wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. the fellas down here said they'd back me--
what's wrong?
when they find it, they find it.
no there are variables that, like, i might not be good at.
a new venture of mine. it's going to be a restaurant.  do you like it?
i'm not sure --
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger's and walmart. neither of which keep purchase records.
not taken.
we can't leave the piano
well, what did i tell ya?
i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  i owe viktor everything.
good party.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's?
we're working as hard as we can --
that's kind of... extreme, walt. andy's private life is none of our business.
you think he's..?
'very well, captain -- i'll pass that on straightaway.'
someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
the federal building was too well guarded.
it's strikes me now i never told her that.
agnes, how did your mother get you?
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day?  the next day we just start over again.
you want something?
i do?
that's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
i guess adele's in good hands.
for some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>the</u> sensual experience.
do you even know who graham greene is?
fine.
i don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
i'm still poor.
it's called "burger manifesto, part one the dialectical expression of testosterone." isn't that a great title?
what's with mike?
poor ike.
stop that, will you!  those idiots! so they sprang dunbar! so what good is it? he's still in the compound, isn't he? how long can he last? where can they hide him?
if i get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
i told you i was a little bit out of step.  a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
the telephone? it continues to ring.
i just got off the phone with the cops.  they called to check you brought the cab in...
there's no need for any of this. your condition can be treated. whistler and i were working on a cure when --
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? this is a... why? why would you do that?

well, i got married to one of them.
that's me.
listen, callaghan.
maybe i can do something right.
no, really.
you ain't the kicker, are you?
well, look here!
well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
what?
see 'em?  they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. broke my windshield...
something on your mind, lisa?
hide your laptop here.
here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
you gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
don't even joke about that!
seymour? you gotta be kidding me!
yeah.
now just a second -- i'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
yes... i just... did. the moment they told me...
what are you talking about?
it will be hardest on spock. soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood.
i wanted to. i thought we could make it.
i had a good time tonight, miles. i really did.
clear the bridge, captain...?
oh, my!
in jerry's safety deposit box.
they don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  they just don't want you writing pictures for now. that's all.
harry.
did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?
ow!!
i'm warning you.  you don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
i don't know.
ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  you could choke on the diesel smoke already!
you don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
come on.
hey you.
it's a...full length life-size figure!
you don't have to drown that fella, spanky. you already scared him half to death. he didn't know who he was fucking with.
look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
i just told them the local situation. colonel heffner's in full charge now.
finest governor we've ever had in m'sippi.
i think you ought to give this matter some thought, mr. deeds.
cole. don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
here we are... it's mocha mint from lickety splits. oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.

this is sensitive. your car. lovely car. doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
you want me to pick up a painting?
not that i don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
you're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend richard low, not suspect zero. i have to tell you, mack, i'm not comfortable where you're going.
what?
what's that?
no--not offhand--
richard stensland.
way to not overthink it.  so when do we leave?
and you say you never signed this contract with mr. allen?
i suppose so. he sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
i watched my mother die. cancer. she had a long time to think about it. they say you reach an agreement with death. come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. i didn't see that. she... was very brave...braver than i am. you go up there, there isn't time to think. if you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. simplifies funeral arrangements.
under the underground.  can i like go now?!
are you sick, mama?
what?  we both have cars.
what the fuck is going on here?
on your feet, fella.  i've got to get outside and see how my men are.

i am not a seaman.  but i heard it is no more than a week at sea.  i hope you are not too disappointed.
okay, i guess.
i'm not in the mood.
it's me.
tell me why!
so this is the planet houston . . .
he had something.  he showed me how to bend the rules.  a little levitation.  a few fireworks.
mr. chance, assuming what you say is the truth, i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
the realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat.
i wanna fuck darcy.
the center counter defense. the thing is not to move your queen too early.
suppose i wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would i need a warrant?
what did he say?
i remember a mrs. delaney but mama told me years ago she died.

his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians. most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey. the money wasn't there for dope. the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them.
for example?
what's the matter?
no. that is what you get for distracting me.
i don't want you to untie me. kill him and then i'll give you the money.
i want to see the body.
how come ben can't turn it on and off like us?
and if he's not...?
for always, then. only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, i'll dip my beak just a little.  just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
stop it, doyle!
not all...i needed another four months and i would have had them all.  i guess you've figured it all out?
here. swallow.
ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? a dissertation on apples, we don't need!
well, i mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
fuck that shit, man. i ain't shootin' anybody.
sorry, dick.  she's a little tipsy.
mmmmmmmph?
i'll carry the instruments.
twenty-five years.
it's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. i told you about 'em.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
so are we, it looks like.
i just want to go back to my room.
maybe you'll understand this, because you know john, but he confuses me sometimes.
no, not at all.
why would he do that?  you didn't have anything to do with the accident.
good morning, fraulein schlumberg.
how much sleep do you need?
will you be getting back together? when you quit hollywood, i mean.
take the keys, man. listen to music.
forget about me, are you a puppet for dela?
how certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
how many is that, six? pretty hungry, weren't you?
a photon tube...!
ahhhhhh!
listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  say hello to the kids. they've grown.
relax. emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. and your hips are as slim as hers.
what i saw?
well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
yeah, i know...how are things out there in chicagoland?
our money situation is not good.
taking care of business.
mary clarence.  goose.  we're completely self-supporting.  like all convents. like yours.
miss clara's boy, emory, to start with. the johnson's hocker was another one...
c'mon, these are the bomb, i prom...
you don't believe in god anymore.
i'm sick and i'm in love.
you're right... i don't.  i just need to know that this thing is out of here!  you hear me, roger ramjet?
what the hell happened down there, worf?
what the hell is that?
hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
nanook...
what are you trying to say? just because i dress well and like to dance --
no?  i guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
fill in the blank. i don't mind the office. the point is, you only go 'round once. like the zens say -- be here now.
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day, mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
all they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch, lieutenant.
why are you here? why didn't you die?
mac, can you hear me?  come in?
it's a fucking shame.
what cha say, benny -- meet 'the rock.' this is our cutman, benny stein.
hi, peter.
okay. don't worry about it. it's okay.
but there is no front, charlie. there's a very doubtful civil war. besides, i don't want the job.
what, you're afraid?
i'll be down front.  you better start putting your face on.
i haven't enjoyed mass this much in years.  what a marvelous program. innovative.  inspiring.  you are to be commended.
fuck jimmy and the money. didn't i tell you i gotta get out of here first.  i gotta straighten every- thing out with paulie or i'm dead.
see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings.  funny thing but i can't really remember how she looked.  i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package.  can't put it together for some reason.
well... come on.
i bombed. it's either work in the office or nothing.
they feel cheated.
you are writing another book, aren't you? that's why you're here. the story's not over.
for your information, mr lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself. though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
you're tellin' me. i swear, this town has gone crazy.
we've done the hard part now.  i might as well, you know...
you're a very unusual stenographer --
i'm sorry, erin.
madam will dress now, it is late.
we'll call swat.  we'll get the locals.  throw it!
i'm walking there kris.
i have my connections
if they're blocked memories... i'm starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out. allison i think i really... screwed everything up.
i have no conviction, if that's what you mean. i blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy.
are you writing?
party ain't started yet, dick.  got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... there's some fellows i want you to meet.
do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
what's the money for?
that's right.
what's this boy got that susie likes?
please.  you shouldn't stand on my account.
and then what? after supper, music? whispers?
not particularly.
will i see you tonight?
you just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  i told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
the jews aren't the middle, henry. they're the far left.
we can appeal, but i can't guarantee anything.
hmmmm... well, the scampi sounds good...
i'm stayin', homer.
as your attorney, i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
what are you going to do?
to freedom.
mr. president! will the senator yield?
we were supposed to be together.
"straw god" changed my life.
i need your name and address.
it means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
what?
you have a blind grandfather. one day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. i read about it. you're going to be famous. you're going to invent a lot of things.
come take a look. an entire-suite of main-frame computer.
musta got some primo bondsman.
i don't feel anything.
please, general, i will give you money, whiskey.
man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
you'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
yeah. i really blew it. i still think about her.
she grabbed you?  impossible.  the precogs aren't even aware of us. in the milk all they see is the future.
... what does that mean?
anything else?  maybe a sandwich?
where did you learn how to do that?
i've never been treated that way, and i'm not going to start now.
hold still. why?
no. the little one.
say, you were pretty good. jumping in like that. got a brain, haven't you?
i don't want them hurt. any of 'em...
lloyd, what happened...?
the kiber crystal.
no wonder you jumped in the river.
this looks like the best spot.
you want to try?
so what were they doing here?
what are you saying?
well, i don't know. the week started off okay, but then i was outside watering the plants, and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect, so i went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
that's not crazy. i like you too.
-- is what?
i used... i used to dream you were alive... and then i'd wake up and lose you all over again.
howard hunt? ... jesus christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
how should i know?...
have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
you misunderstood.  no one sees max.
i can't tell you the things he said, charlie.  you haven't got any idea -
'fore i blow that bitch's brains out, i'll ask her.
wesley...
welcome?
good.
but i can't be sure.  i don't even know who he is.  he's too insulated.  too many layers around him.
have you been working with rachel?
still, please.
you called me jeffrey.
you like it?
you sent for me, sir?
yes, that would be nice - i'll call round some time...
where does she live?
wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.
well. i got an audition tomorrow.
this'll be nice. we haven't seen any of the sights yet. it's history. when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this.
gladly, caesar.  and, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
i hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. i am a ...
airport.
and you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time.
sulu, what are you doing?
no, don't talk like that, son. we're going to get you fixed up.
we decided...
i, i was asked to do this material - -
leave me alone, conor.  please.
... like mexico.  or jamaica.  or new york, even.
i shouldn't have done that.  i shouldn't have done that.
mauduh...
