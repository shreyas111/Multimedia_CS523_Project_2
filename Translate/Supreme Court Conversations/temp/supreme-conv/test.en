i don't  
how would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced? and he said, right, yes, that's correct?
excuse me. i didn't understand it.
the place where it comes from is the idea that if, in fact, you have these monetary crimes, white collar kinds of crimes, money is at issue, and no one is hurt. you can proceed against a person under federal law  
  it does. why   why is that   i mean, it seems to me counsel should stand up on his two feet and say, we're raising a federal question. why is that too much of an imposition when the statute requires that you raise a federal question? why do we have to go researching what the state supreme court said several years ago?
how do they know that? 10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a particular job evaluation and that dictated the amount of pay that that employee was going to get for that period and all, all subsequent pay built on that base, and then it turns out many years later that there was discrimination in the way the employee was evaluated way back when, even though there was no complaint about it; then under your theory that would be a present title vii violation, to cut a paycheck that built, that was based on pay that was built on this act of discrimination that occurred long ago?
i   i don't agree that it would be over-inclusive, given the court's analysis in atkins. the court said that someone who has that level of mental retardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by definition. that certainly would not be true here. there are 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who are 18, 20, 25, or some other age.
and, there, i thought the court said   i mean, i was reading it   say, "well, it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses for the delay." what about the words that were written there, "on the merits"?
as mr. olson pointed out, under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. so that's kind of a different thing.
under oregon law, under the majority's holding in this case and the way they dealt with the grandfather's prior testimony, on remand defendant could have the mother's transcript from the guilt phase read, but what would be different about it under the oregon supreme court holding, and what we're asking the court to address, is what they can do with that alibi testimony, no matter what form it comes in. and that's the significant part of the supreme court holding.
yes, your honor.
  begins and ends  
but justice scalia's point is, no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall. and if it didn't fall for the larger number of native americans involved who use peyote, and the very small number using this drug, can't we, kind of, think that at least, "well, maybe it's not all that compelling"?
could they do that?
the search is only going to be effective if it's not announced or  
but it's not hard to do. you just ask someone at stanford. they'll do it for you. (laughter.)
but you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the united states out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the united states subject to suit when the person who has authority to do   do these things goofs. i mean, what   what trouble has the united states saved itself? it would still have to ride herd over   over the person with   with whom it's dealing.
  agree that  
mr. zagrans, there is language in merrell dow that makes it sound like it's not as clear and certain as you are urging. i think that the opinion author said that 1331's domain is shaped by the demands of reason and coherence, dictates of sound judicial policy, and common sense. and if you just take that last question when the only question is, is mail notice good enough to satisfy the federal statute, or do you have to have in-hand service? doesn't common sense say what that section means should be a federal question, appropriate for a federal court to decide?
no, it didn't.
with respect, your honor, what part (c) says, which is what you're reading from, it says, "the incidence of the tax is imposed on the distributor of first receipt." that is the "who." that is not the "what." the "what" is in   is in 79-3408(a), and it is clearly imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of the fuel. if i could, another provision of the statute that also  
yes, your honor. we agree that teaching suggestion and motivation are valid means of proving obviousness, valid considerations for the court. and this court's precedents are entirely consistent with that. a number of cases cited by respondent show that the court has looked to suggestion as a means to determining whether a patent is obvious. the problem with the federal circuit's test is it makes that the exclusive test and precludes obviousness determinations in the absence of satisfaction of that test which this court's precedents are clearly not consistent with. in fact in graham itself, in the sakraida case, in dann against johnston, lower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of suggestion. this court reversed without requiring or even addressing the question whether there was some explicit principle that had been proven by the party challenging the patent, by clear evidence that there was such a teaching suggestion motivation. it's just foreign to this court's precedents as a mandatory prerequisite for obviousness.
okay. but are you making the argument that this number indicates a congressional intent and that what we ought to do is come up with a rule because congress intended it? or are you making the argument that yours is the better rule, and as a matter of common law, which   which it is our responsibility to develop, we should see it your way? which argument are you making?
does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the   one party's product in this case?
under the  
yes, yes.
to   to alaska. excuse me. and it's followed by another proviso which says that the united states will continue to control fish and game matters in alaska until the secretary of interior has certified that alaska is ready to do so. clearly that proviso is not a subset  
  a number  
right.
  that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.
because of their   because of   of the representations that were made during the public records litigation. that was based upon   that was what we based our assumption on, knowing that they still had the ability to change it all the way up until the date that mr. hill was scheduled to be executed.
  wants to fill up its truck and   and it said, well, this is going to be   the only haul this season for me, so i want the 3-day permit.
  because it's been unclear, until this court has spoken to the subject, and especially in light of the dicta in our prior cases, which says that he has to be speaking publicly. the reason for the   for the   for the paucity of cases can be, simply, that the law was not clear, and most people thought the way   the way your opponent in this case thinks.
this court has held that the tribe   that a tribe may abandon aboriginal title to land.
no, no, no. i said we didn't file a motion to dismiss  
well, don't take your time to look it up. maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.
until april 20th of next year, your honor.
i'm looking at the findings of fact. they're in the petition appendix at page 46 and 47. i don't see anything that has been specifically identified by the finder of fact as inadequate, other than the failure to knock. where   where did the   where does the court say it doesn't rise to the level of exigent circumstances?
but it takes you out of beck, at least arguably, doesn't it? the   the question is, have you raised something that is necessarily on all fours with beck? and given this sentencing scheme, we can't say that simply raising a state claim necessarily raises the beck claim. isn't that true?
well, invent some other hypothetical then. i'm talking about a situation in which the federal law is more permissive than the state law. which law prevails? the federal law allows this bank to do things which the state law would not allow it to do. as i understood your prior answer, you say oh, of course, if the federal law allows to it do things the state law doesn't allow to it do, the federal law prevails. i didn't understand that to be your position. and if it is your position, i don't know what all this fuss is about. that's the end of the game, isn't it?
there's no injury to competition that is the effect of such  
thank you, mr. schwartz. now mr. joseffer.
my answer to that is there is no substantive distinction between a levy and a lien. and that while williams dealt with a lien, and i fully understand that, the taking by the government was just as involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien. and once section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held to be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it should encompass an action by the levy. essentially i'm arguing that the two statutes can coexist together and should coexist together in the absence of a clear declaration from congress that 7426 is exclusive. i can support my argument by the fact that after williams, congress did make, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy and they're exclusive. congress could have done that at the time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not do so.
what is the actual evidence that was suppressed? and to what extent is that evidence that wasn't available just from looking in through the door?
i'm asking if it's a violation of   of the rule.
you may be right, justice ginsburg. i think the important point to take away from muniz is that the court stressed that, whatever the measure of the united states' liability would be for the claims at issue in that case, it could not be the state law as it related to governmental entities; that one would have to, as the text requires, look to state law as it relates to private persons. the point that i  
okay, but why  
it was longshoremen working on the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.
no, your honor. that is the merits determination. and   and the statute tracks  
the sentencing reform act required, as enacted by congress, required trial judges to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. and you're saying that the sentencing reform act now precludes appellate review of   it gives the trial judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad discretion?
has he applied for such a visa? has he expressed any intention to apply?
or anything else that somebody might do after getting intoxicated?
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to suggest that   the truth of that allegation may be open to question, but what is not open to question  
well, but that doesn't  
there's no doubt   justice scalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, but this policy of california is directed not to the gang aspect of it but to the race aspect. the record is clear that there's a near zero percent chance that any black person could be housed with any white person, that any white person could be housed with any hispanic person, without reference to the gang question. and this is a transfer policy which recurs and recurs, five times in the case of   of  
that is to say, if it discriminates?
and this is the   the only purpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to   to say is this person within one injury compensation scheme or another.
well, aren't we dealing here with a time bar issue?
the court did not find that they were insufficient under penn central. the court found that under state compensation law, which it believed was congruent with this court's decision in penn central  
i don't believe it does, and perhaps i'm   i'm   i wasn't making clear what my argument is. the court has adopted a very narrow probate exception with respect to the probating of the will and annulling a probated will, but that is it. and that analysis was based on a   the historical   the court's view of the historical limits of courts of equity and therefore was an interpretation of the federal diversity statute. under the logic of ankenbrandt, one can assume   one may   the court may assume that's carried forward. but certainly that   for the reasons i've said, that rationale, those justifications, for that narrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have always been the province of equity, and especially given the questionable historical underpinnings of the exception, even the narrow exception that does appear to exist, there's no justification for expanding that beyond its current confines. as this court recognized in ankenbrandt, the lower courts had taken the   the so-called domestic relations exception beyond this court's very narrow limits, and this court brought   brought it back to its origins. and   and the federal government believes that   that the same would be appropriate here with respect to the probate exception.
in matlock, did the   did the absent person say no?
oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means. the secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.
yes.
well, yes.
do we think have a duty to follow precedents that don't make any sense?
in practice the answer is no. if there are no other questions, your honors, i urge the court to affirm.
your honor, i believe the court in   i believe the court in schlup took the word reasonable to encompass the point which i have just made.
and  
no. your honor, we think the rule is the same in all of the various situations that could arise under the statute   the complaining party, whether it's the parents, as in this case, or the school district, as in many other instances. and, justice breyer, you're right, one of the situations that is covered by this statute is where a child with a disability acts out in class, and the school has to take disciplinary action against that child. in that situation, idea regulates the actions that the school district can take. and if the parents believe that the school district has   take a more severe disciplinary action than is required by the statute, school   the school district, or the parents, could initiate a challenge in that situation. in fact, there are many parts of the statute that we think speak to the question, or at least  
i would hope the case would come out differently than  
all the water goes down to the sea and there's some kind of a drain or   or a bed that takes the water down there.
that's right. congress has removed the discretion in this class of cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.
  that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a   of a business?
yes, but you need to get to whether there is   do you urge dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the merits? it's not clear to me at all.
yes, it was.
yes, but the question that i asked you is, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system, federal or state, as distinguished from where can i grab this person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my venue choices, is there any other example in all of title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes, this   every place where it's located counts?
i think it is  
well, i would   i would hesitate, justice souter, to go from taking a specific word, like "discharge," and, therefore, saying that it meant something that is both more general and much more easily set.
i don't know what the court might mean by the word trivial, justice kennedy, but this is a very significant major amount involved in this case. there is no question that the parties are very serious. it's a very significant legal question with respect to the interpretation.
well, of course   of course, the distributor is drawing it down to sell fuel to gasoline stations.
oh, so we can assume that that was valid. you're   you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?
  i think that's a given. the question is whether or not he agrees   he indicates affirmatively that he wants to begin talking.
well, if the position of the government were more fairly represented they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to claim that everything we're doing under color of law is retaliation, because then we'll hear that against irs agents, we'll hear it against osha agents. so long as you   and their position is you have a remedy for everything you're complaining about, and you invoked some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and so you didn't prevail. but don't create a whole new remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually.
well, why not? isn't it realistic to assume that congress looked at the state of the law at the time it's passing a statute and presumably adopted what was the prevailing view?
yes, but the district attorney has   i mean, the   the point here is we're judging the district attorney's responses, not the judge's responses.
that's correct, your honor.
i think that's a very typical practice.
well, certainly the attorney has a legal right to those funds. he has a contractual right and under most  
where was the gun found?
well, your honor, then that would, respectfully, eviscerate any   any notion of   of the statute of limitations  
it's a wire fraud statute dealing with the use of communications capacity in this country to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling of goods.
well, your honor, i would have to disagree with your honor respectfully. i think that the   that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the particular vehicle that's involved here. and i   i think you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the scope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not all state fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are preempted.
can you repeat that 355 what?
yes.
the second case  
she may   yes, i think.
but the   the argument here is   is in the context of deciding which citizen an entity is a citizen   which state an entity is a citizen of, we normally don't think that entities are citizens of multiple states. just as you wouldn't think if   if you're asking, you know, where does the ford motor company manage its   its operations from, you wouldn't think from multiple states. so here when you're talking about citizenship, why doesn't this argument of context cut precisely against you? we're talking about citizenship. people aren't citizens of   of 50 states. i mean, that   that's an extraordinary result to reach.
what about mistake?
but it's not mentioned in the opinion.
yes.
well, the remedies were acquittal. he was acquitted, for example.
and it's, and it's a troubling case.
why is it her incentive to reduce recovery? she may not be getting anything more, but why does she have incentive to reduce it?
  that don't go to the labeling.
well, is it an agency policy that the state endorses, and if so, why   why do you endorse or adopt the policy?
justice breyer, the answer is because 1346 also permits a third party to bring a refund action. it is not restricted even though there is a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held to be broad enough to   to encompass the refund action.
well, why then isn't the proper disposition of this case to send it back to the ninth circuit to consider all these other arguments?
how many cases are there on habeas in california every year, about?
your honor, i think the answer is yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting signs in school. i believe that would be  
no. at that time, there does. but we're talking about at the time of arrest. and it   it just   if the closely related offense doctrine has the effect of punishing an officer for explaining to the suspect a reason for the arrest, why is that a good doctrine? i mean, if the officer could say nothing and could end up, at the end of the day, having a valid arrest, i just think the closely related doctrine doesn't serve a very good purpose.
doesn't, doesn't subsection b(ii) address outliers? i was surprised there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and maybe it's, it's because of some reason i'm unaware of. that says that the secretary in making this determination can take into account particular types of leas where there is extra, additional costs. i would have thought for example if you had a very small lea with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high because you don't have economies of scale, that you haven't   that would, could be knocked out for that reason. is that not how that works?
yes.
  would a mother-in-law. [laughter.]
well, i'm sure of that, and it involves a reconciliation of  
well  
so a quid pro quo violation does not have to be an adverse employment action.
the case is submitted.
the   the prosecutor, at the very end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if grudgingly with it, to recognize that   that this evidence was mitigating. i'm looking at page 76 of the joint appendix at the top of the page. he makes the statement, the law is simple. it says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line up? well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et cetera   that's on the aggravating side. and then against that, defendant really has nothing except newborn christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old. so that   in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to be saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're insubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a newborn christian.
  of an inquiry.
no, your honor   that's correct, your honor. but the statute provides that the tax is on the sale by the distributor to the tribe on its reservation. it is exactly like what happened in central machinery. in central machinery, the incidence of the tax was indisputably on the off-reservation seller. this court, nevertheless, said, correctly, that the taxable event, the thing that was being taxed, was the sale of tractors to the tribe on the reservation  
well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.
i think you're telling us that the state cannot accommodate religion. the only way they can do it is to put the ten commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose. it seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.
  i'm suggesting  
do you think  
yes.
all right. so what are the words you use in the opinion, that would separate your case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to charge them, from the case that they're worried about, which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation is, really involves activity that could be quite legitimate? now, now   what words would i write in the opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep from the goats?
so on the phone, somebody is describing very calmly   very calmly to the policeman the terrible crime that he sees going on in front of him. now, i gather from the fact that it's an   that it is a exception, that now in the federal courts that would be admissible.
  the product, here? i mean, if they had not   if they had not entered, they would not have gotten their evidence. their entry, because it violated knock-and-announce, was unlawful. so, it is a product, isn't it?
justice o'connor, there's nothing that says we want to take over the regulation of medicine, but it's crystal clear  
does a parent have a right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors?
you're willing to let those people go?
  one the same. you see, what they're saying here is   they want to say that what i've just said is what congress wrote in this act. and  
it's   i'm trying to figure out how   how   what the theory is. is   you say i have a right to receive payments because of age. and you say, well, here i have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. so it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is   is   stops the   the younger person getting the money. so does the case then turn on that? i mean, suppose   suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. then should i reach the other result? i'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. what's the right analysis?
not to the navigating part but to what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in navigation.
thank you, mr. gits. ms. cortina, you have a little over 5 minutes left.
and he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved.
  california supreme court sometimes decide that the time between the intermediate court's decision and the filing in the california supreme court   don't they ask whether that was reasonable?
i   i had thought that your proposal was de novo review. this is   this is new to me, that   that you want it clearly erroneous.
  by law.
in that scenario, if the evidence is overwhelming as   as perhaps it was in neder, one might assume that the error is uncontroverted. but  
i don't think so, your honor. i think you can, because i think that you can do it as an alternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal in the nature  
is that what  
your honor, as chief justice roberts mentioned in the last case you heard this morning, first look to the plain language, as the solicitor general has pointed out in numerous briefs  
suppose   suppose in the earlier conviction, the police report is in the court. it's not part of the record, and then the court says, i've read the police report. is that accurate? and the client   or the defendant says, yes. then later, can we go back and look at the police report even though it was not annexed as part of the record?
ms.  
no, that's   actually gets me back to the second part of justice breyer's question, which is protection. and it's a complete hit-or-miss situation across the country. and just to respond to something that was said about the federal whistle-blower protection act, that statute has a gaping hole in it, as construed by the federal circuit, because the federal circuit has construed it to exclude protection for speech that is part of the employee's normal duties. so, in any case that would come up with a federal employee, leaving aside what judicial remedies are even available for a federal employee in this area, the federal employee would be largely unprotected by the federal whistle-blower statute. and with respect to what the state of law is across the country, it's complete patchwork. different types of speech are protected, there's huge holes in coverage. there is no  
but i think that the point that justice souter is trying to make, as i understand it, is of course there are similarities to gratz, they can choose, but there's a big difference. the similarity in grutter, or the difference in grutter and gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed to be better than others, that the members of that school, the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others. it was an elite merit selection academy. and if you put the black person in, the white person can't get the benefit of that. here we have no merit selection system. merit is not an issue. the object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others, it is to equalize the schools. that's in principle and in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that the six schools that were at the top, their position would shift radically from year to year, preferences was about equal among them. they have the same curriculum, they have similar faculties, and i don't think anyone can say either in theory or in practice, that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of university of michigan, a merit selection system. that, i think, was a major difference that he was getting at, why is this not the same kind of thing? that was at issue in grutter and gratz. now what is your response to that?
  an abuse.
i'm trying to give you a chance to explain why this looks like rico rather than just criminal conspiracy. and you've come up you said interstate commerce. there's got to be more than one. well, none of that really suggests a distinction. what   what is it that makes this a rico case rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?
well, i'm with you  
that's correct, your honor.
absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor. that waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal. so that waiver has no effect whatsoever on  
well, it seems to me the government is equally remiss for not pointing out the obligations of the court under the act. but let me ask you this. probably you can respond to that as well if you like. what are the problems with reindicting   i mean, how   how is the government hurt if it can reindict? i recognize that it's costly to the system, et cetera. but is there any real prejudice there?
yes, your honor. i think the classic example would be if a plaintiff's complaint, for whatever reasons of negligence or error, misalleges the plaintiff's state of residence; thus, making the defendant reasonably believe that there is complete diversity, defendant removes, plaintiff then submits affidavits and property records and everything showing it really was a mistake. and  
we don't know   he didn't know this defendant.
what about the fact that a state has a lower income tax or a lower property tax than any other state in the union? does that violate the commerce clause because it induces businesses to  
mr. gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for federal employment? title vii does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to federal employees, if i understand.
  it's not distinction. i'm sorry. the federal court  
with respect, mr. chief justice, i'm not sure i'd pick day 4 of the august recess to do that. maybe 14 days before they're going back, something like that, would be an appropriate time to catch their attention in a   in a period where they're going to remember it when they go and vote. but i think day 4 of a 45-day recess is probably not when i would pick to start running these ads. i don't suggest, though, the timing factor or any other one factor ought to be dispositive. i think what it goes to show is how difficult it would be to try to get into a fact-intensive as-applied analysis of these various issues. and all of that presumably would have to be done in the context of tro hearings and preliminary injunction hearings on the eve of elections.
you   you agree with that. i   you're caught in between us here, and i understand. (laughter.)
that's right, for  
very well, mr. hungar. mr. cappuccio, we'll hear from you.
  "you just sit around until it's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be accepted, because it's too late, and then you can come into federal court." this is going to cut back considerably on the number of frivolous claims?
thank you, ms. brinkmann. mr. waxman, we'll give you 3 minutes.
justice scalia, that was precisely the defense that volvo made at trial. they put it to the jury, "remember, it has to be like kind and quality. we are required to demonstrate that the truck that we are getting a 10 percent discount on and the truck that they're getting a 20 percent discount on is exactly the same like kind and quality of truck." and that was their defense. and our witness meticulously   i'd commend the record to you if you want to read it   but he meticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that, systematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to a dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than the truck they sold to us, in order to implement the "volvo vision" and drive my client  
may i ask   excuse me.
and   and whether they are or not has nothing to do with   with balisok and heck.
and did the parents' satisfaction with it break out along racial lines? or was it evenly divided?
is   is goodin the case that   that stands for the proposition that under   under state law, the   the jury has an   an option to sentence for life, as   as well as   as to impose the death sentence?
we submit the due process violation comes at the time of the motion to vacate. we urge   we're urging that they've not take an agnostic position as prosecutors. they're   they're urging again saying the   the evidence is ample to support that   that stumpf was   was the shooter.
thank you, mr. owen. mr. marshall.
  if   if he   he had made a statement about a co-conspirator's statement during the course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have here the testimony of the   his co-conspirator, that would not make it testimony. and if the   the 911 call  
that  
ten to 20.
i'm not sure if i would tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, is a wise expenditure of resources. i'll think about that.
this wasn't kind of constructed as a test case, by any chance, was it?
that is not the case.
that   unless you want to go on, that doesn't help me. we just tell all the judges in the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no more?
yes, but i'm not talking about a particular location. i'm talking about we know it's going to be one of 17   or make it 50, if you like. we don't know which of those.
  what if the trial judge who looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss the indictment, or its equivalent at this time   said, "well, i'm going to construe these words 'conspired or agreed' as the substantial equivalent of 'aiding and abetting.'" would that let the charge stand?
well, what did he find when he studied that? it was exactly the same for those two procedures. i'm sorry.
pardon me?
  exhaust their internal remedies.
  which  
right.
it has nothing to do with the prices that end up.
no, i don't think so  
no, no, it's not nebulous. it's absolutely clear. in the one hand, you are targeting a particular defendant to raise   a particular competitor to raise his costs. in the other hand, you are taking an action that simply lowers your own and, therefore, equally will hurt any competitor, whether there's one or a million.
i don't   i don't think it is arbitrary, your honor, and i would suggest that there's two reasons why did that. the first is that as a backdrop rule they believed that it's not a good policy to have fiduciaries suing participants and beneficiaries for money, and when they thought that there was a good reason like 502(g), they expressly enumerated it. the second reason i think that they   they did this is because the only times when it might make sense to recover money for the violation of a plan term, for the most part, fall within   under the rubric of unjust enrichment. and i believe that congress, rightfully so, thought that there were non   sufficient non-erisa remedies whereby a plan could assert truly equitable unjust enrichment claims. so there was no need to provide that remedy in the civil enforcement provisions of erisa. so if we look at that as the backdrop rule and apply it to barnes and that line of cases, i would suggest that mamsi's reading of the barnes line of cases is very dangerous.
it may.
is there any impediment to new york suing him? this would be   it's kind of strange. new york has its tax scheme. it has penalties for failure to pay tax. and then it could go into the federal court and say rico is better than our penalties. rico has treble damages.
in an ordinary tort case  
and you're making it as a separate argument here. but here, you're making it as to all claims against all state institutions; whereas, below you made it only as to the claims against vmi. i don't understand that.
the sense it makes it this. what the armed career criminal act addresses and what this court discussed in taylor was the applicable term is conviction, that is, a conviction for a categorical offense. the categorical offense is a crime of violence specifically described as burglary, arson, but there are specifically described crimes. those are things that you can determine as a matter of law. do the elements match the   the generically violent crime, or do they not match the generically violent crime? if they do not match the generically violent crime, you might still be able to figure out, you might be able to surmise what the defendant actually had in his mind, if he had anything in his mind, about this at the time of the guilty plea. well, one of the unique things about the   these nongeneric burglary statutes in massachusetts is that they're really relatively petty offenses.
the false charges scenario is  
  they would pay the same flat fee.
yes, i'm speaking  
  position that  
  that would otherwise be applicable. so we're assuming that the arrangement is there and that they're engaging in illegal activity.
mr. salmons, may i ask before you begin whether the united states agrees that the statute would apply to the activities of these ships when they're on the high seas?
i'm sorry?
thank you, mr. donovan. the case is submitted.
well, i   i don't think it's a necessary reading.
  equal partners  
or that a new case has been   has been released and we think that bears on   on the outcome.
i read footnote 5. you said it didn't. but i don't see how that's consistent with the language of the statute.
well, i'll accept your view as being the personal experience. i'm rather surprised that district courts would go through all of these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and they may not have to.
and it's only because you lost that you now question whether or not they should have accepted   you're saying they shouldn't have accepted responsibility, and shouldn't have defended on the merits.
i don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if   if you choose. but it seems to me relevant to (a). does   is   is part of the submission that the government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and   of   of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?
do you think the procedure should be any different between capital cases and noncapital cases? we're basically talking about what would be an abuse of discretion, as you indicated at the outset. do you think the same rule should apply to both, or do you think there might be   because there is a greater incentive to delay in the capital case than there is in the noncapital case.
capacity to fire does not mean per se operability. it   it means that this instrument has the capacity to fire whether or not  
but the whole point of the westfall act is to get rid of those state causes of action.
well  
  where  
no.
that's correct. the law  
does it once a week, and i'm not using any adjective to characterize it. it just happens once a week.
that's right.
right, and a different bargain has been reached in the criminal context, and in that context to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult choice of revealing classified information or proceeding, the congress has come through with the classified information procedures act. that only applies in the criminal side, though.
whatever the resolution  
yes, and we argue in our brief exactly that. but we hope today to focus in oral argument at least first on the fourteenth amendment violation, which is the intentional use of race both as intentional vote dilution, as well as the analytically distinct claim under shaw v. miller. with respect to the question whether latino voters voted with such a high correlation   and that's the phrase used from easley v. cromartie   whether there was such a high correlation between latino voters and democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to justify removing them because of their race and then saying that they were democrats, that nexus simply doesn't exist under the facts of this case. besides the state's arguments and   and the many assertions that it makes with respect to latino voting support for republican candidates and especially congressman bonilla, we also have latino voting for bonilla that rises and falls. if latinos were close adherents to the democratic ticket, you wouldn't see fluctuating support for congressman bonilla. you would see low and steady support if latinos were democratic voters. instead, we see something very different, which is congressman bonilla gaining support in the latino community within his district up until 1996 where the peak is 30 percent latino support and then a steady decline over a series of elections, ending in 2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found, latino support for congressman bonilla. this is not  
and therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.
what you state is true, but by the time of the penalty phase retrial, mr. deck's position, to paraphrase from martinez v. court of appeal, had changed dramatically. he had already been convicted. add to that he had already pursued his direct appeal through the missouri supreme court.
until the 2-year point. yes, there were. i don't know exactly how many there were, but there definitely were.
the restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it. and if i had to find my way out of the restitution problem, i would pick the ambiguous statute to get out, rather than simply saying, "well, though this restitution statute says this categorically, we will ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be enforcing the revenue laws of another country." there's nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another country, if we want to; this is just a question of statutory interpretation. should this ambiguous statute be interpreted that way? if congress said, "we're going to enforce canada's tax laws," there's nothing wrong with that. but  
no.
thank you, your honor. i just wanted to say in closing that   that it is a difficult statute, but i think that mr. dodd's interpretation of the statute best respects congress' use of tense and is consistent with the reading of paragraph 8(2) that this court gave in tyler. it also respects congress' intention to create a specific exception for new rights that apply retroactively and by allowing for the realistic possibility of   of success in either an initial or a second or successive motion premised on such rights. it also, as we've discussed, promotes judicial efficiency by eliminating from it frivolous motions because litigants would not file until it was clear that they actually had a right to collateral relief. in sum, this court should conclude that the triggering date is when all three of the prerequisites have been met. in this case, that would be when the eleventh circuit decided ross v. richardson. i guess my   my final concern is for my client. if the court constructs a rule where the supreme court would have to be the court that makes the retroactivity decision, i hope the court will consider the effect of such a rule on someone like my client who filed prematurely on   in   in hopes that at some point his arguably meritorious richardson claim would be heard. whether the court decides that those premature filings should be dismissed without prejudice or if there's some kind of analysis the lower courts should take in resolving those claims  
i   i know you want to get to 22 the other issue in this case, but let me ask you. you've, 23 i assume, read these cases. in   in other states where 24 this instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say, 25 well, sure, there's life without parole, but that can 1 change? we don't know what the law will be like 3 years 2 from now, 5. have there been any problems along that   3 along those lines? have there been any problems generally 4 in giving this instruction to the jury?
if there were to be a settlement, in the second case, the   it would not be an article iii case or controversy problem with the second case. and that suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1).
but justice scalia, this court has never held that such a restriction is a condition precedent or required in order for a person to assert third party rights.
yes, while you're   and the state could easily prevent that by setting up some kind of prefiling requirement for  
the case is settled?
well, that's a very different question. that's interpreting the scope of congress's power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment. the issue is whether it's limited to the constitutional violations or sweeps more broadly. if you conclude that it sweeps more broadly, it's not suggesting that an as-applied challenge can be brought by someone who's covered by the broader sweep. that's a very different question. is there any first amendment case where we've said this is facially valid and then said as-applied challenges can't be brought?
right. conceptually, it's possible. and certainly there is an argument that the bankruptcy code says that preferential transfer is, in fact, property of the state. with respect, however, to a preference to a state, we would say that that particular reading, as applied to the state, is unconstitutional. i don't believe congress can make a law which would require the state to divest money or something to which the state has in its possession in which the state has a colorable claim of ownership. here, there is no dispute that the money is in the state treasury. what they are trying to do is to recover a monetary judgment from the state. as this court said in schoenfeld [sic] and in granfinanciera, this is very much like a contracts claim.
and i can't find that reason idiotic.
i see.
you say poetic, i said metaphysical. when is an indictment not an indictment?
correct.
but it, the portion within the reservation you claim is alienable so long as it's not owned by an oneida. the current owners can sell it to somebody else, right?
can you tell me what   what happens if there's a violation of the daytime warrant provision in   in a search warrant and the search is at night? do we suppress?
we don't have a situation here, justice breyer, where weyerhaeuser presented evidence that they were the most efficient and able to pay higher prices. weyerhaeuser presented no quantitative evidence that it was the lowest cost producer in terms of costs  
and now   and now i want to extrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which asserts its own immunity.
so why don't you at least address how you would distinguish bacchus? because there is a lot of language in there that cuts against your position.
what we'd look to is, you'd look to the purpose of this. the purpose of it was, basically, i gather from the history, as recounted in kosak   in what the court said in kosak   the purpose of this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit that a person could protect himself for the loss by registering the package, by taking out this ordinary transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do. so, they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery claims, all that pack   family of things, everybody'll say, "hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check." i mean, all kinds of things will be opened up. but the government's already liable for what i'd call the "swinging the package around," leaving it   slip-and-fall, trucks. so that falls on the other side. now, how does that hurt you, the government, if that's how we'd come out?
i would say probably a rough guess would be around 10 percent. that's   we're dealing with  
that is the situation that any plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal conspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for certain that there was a conspiracy. we have observed market facts which are suggestive of a conspiracy and we allege that there was a conspiracy. now under conventional standards, all we would have to do is allege that there was a conspiracy and say what it was. we wouldn't have to plead a basis to infer that we are correct or incorrect because that's not the analysis that rule 12(b)(6)  
i guess you can be   i'm sorry, go ahead.
the implication was, "you're not going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer."
  distinction, but i do want to make clear that there are arguments here that you could make in a different state that you can't make in arizona because of the substantive decision that, "we don't want to have a diminished-capacity defense, and we don't want to have that policy judgment frustrated by having the evidence come in through the front door." and to use justice  
yes, your honor. here, what it's saying is that congress is prohibiting "plans to obstruct commerce by robbery or extortion or physical violence or threats of violence." and, justice scalia, when you read the statute to me, some of the words that were skipped over quickly were the words "so to do." notice it says "with regard to robbery or extortion or attempts to do so," comma. if they meant violence and physical violence to only refer to extortion or robbery, as they did with "attempts," then "so to do" could have been put into that clause, as well.
because the   because congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in every situation. and   and it's quite possible that the   there are going to be a lot of situations. and the solicitor general's brief identifies four of them in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the invention, engages in   in various kinds of licensing schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships among the way the patent is going to be developed, and i think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind of case that you pose, mr. chief justice. but that's not this case.
but they could adopt a 60-day rule, or a 90-day rule, and then just, when they decided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on   - say, "well, we did look at the merits in this case."
i mean, concretely, they could put signs on the bulletin board next to the door, they could engage in speech, they could help organize student protests. i would draw the line, though, at saying that they have to go to the undergraduate campus, because i think, as a practical matter  
i think that's exactly right, justice scalia. and that's, again, going back to fausto, official where there is a sensible hierarchy of claims, or a sensible hierarchy of preferences. the court doesn't ordinarily presume that congress put in a structure that doesn't respect that ordinary hierarchy. and the government's construction here is inconsistent with the ordinary hierarchy which allows the government to avoid making payment on more favorable terms; then the government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from private individuals. finally, the government's construction also undermines the intended effect of the statute. the effect of statute   the purpose of statutes of limitations   and this one, in particular   is to provide repose   to allow the individual to know that he will no longer confront government claims, to dispose of his documents, and also to encourage the government to be diligent in pursuing its claims. none of those purposes are achieved, all of those purposes are defeated, if   once the statute of limitations period expires  
and you tell us don't worry about these things dragging on endlessly.
there's no   i guess all i'm saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts. isn't that correct?
oh, no, no. he does it in a public forum. in fact, he hires disney hall. (laughter.)
uh-huh.
price discrimination, i gather, sometimes good, sometimes not. if it pushes out sales  
the compensation would be measured as the difference between the   the rent that was allowed under the regulation or the statute and the rent that the   that the landlord, the lessor, would otherwise be entitled to collect in the marketplace.
well, the way it's done in the states right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are required to go first. and that increases the costs and complexity of these trials for school districts, because the   before the parents have put on their evidence as to why they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is   in this case, why they think the school district hasn't properly characterized their child's disability, the school district has to go forward and present its case, which is a more complex   it's   there's more guesswork involved  
yes, your honor, because this burlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in which there was no limit on   on spending, and both candidates were able to raise amounts either similar to what they had raised in the past or at least amounts that met the campaign budget that they had sought to   to follow. i think in looking at the level of the contribution limits, it's important again to understand the scale of politics in vermont. if we want to compare them to missouri, a $2,000 limit for a gubernatorial race in missouri was approved by this court, and in missouri you had an election in 2000 where each candidate was spending $8 million or $9 million in a gubernatorial race. i mean, that compares very directly if you  
okay.
your honor, i think that the fundamental command of the equal protection clause is that government treats as individuals, not as members of a racial group. and that command i don't think is suspended because of the nature of a school's admissions process. that right is still possessed by the individual students, and if a student is entitled to be treated as an individual as opposed to a member of a racial group at a university level, it's parents' position they are entitled to that same protection at the high school level.
but you're not asking to official recover for the actual harm to the others. you're saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many people, which is similar to what we have here. we don't know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.
they might. the question that we would ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships to their customers. now, under justice breyer's hypothetical, and this is the louisiana public service commission  
well, again  
i think that technically what the california supreme court decided was that our facts did not state a cause of action under state law. what they cite here as findings are actually discussions of the legal issues raised by the state court complaint under state law. they don't amount to a factual finding. there was no trial. there was no summary judgment motion. there was no evidence presented on any of these points. these are  
i understand that. if the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, and you win. but if the language does permit it, the reason   you have to stretch the language, i suspect, in my view to get to the government's result. it might just barely permit it. but one of the things on their side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd result, because of what justice ginsburg said, because there is such variation in the number of pupils among school districts in different states.
and it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody? i mean, if you see that the women are making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape liability by paying everybody the same going forward, because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had been made the women would have making 20 percent more than the men. you have to go back and revisit every pay decision or you're exposed to liability for current pay.
because they understand 4(a)   and let me take you   everyone to the text just so we can all be literally on the same page, and that is going to be in the red brief at page 17a. it is 623(a), and it's the first block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief. they understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions against individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions against groups, group policy versus individual action, and they do that because of the introductory language to (a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit, segregate, or classify his employees.
it's the same jury. it's the same jury. the same jury that found it atrocious and cruel in the guilt phase would find it atrocious and cruel in the weighing stage. i don't see  
there is no  
well  
there was an agreement to arbitrate. and we're talking about a suit brought by one party in the united states, by the other party in china, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although i thought the contract called for it.
see, the only thing about your reading of the statute that troubles me is you're   you're reading the word only. if it's a 1-year statute, but only if congress   the supreme court has already done the next two things. 1 year is the maximum.
excuse me. i really didn't understand that argument. does the state deduct from its medicaid funds the amount that it pays lawyers to conduct medicaid litigation?
the scheme restricts the, the use of funds that are, are properly collected from agency fee payers by the union and  
well, i'm sure that's right. but that simply reinforces my point.
well, but   but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to   to resolve the case. why isn't he? how is that that much different than if a judge   let's assume, under a proper sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong guideline. the man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 10 years. we don't know which. but that's   that's a classic habeas case. here, he's going to stay in a prison for 5 or 10 years. we don't know which. why isn't this a classic habeas case?
my question is really judge boudin's question. you are in effect saying that by siting the school they can achieve exactly the objective they are seeking here. it's a question of do the   the question comes down to whether they can do it candidly or do it by clumsier. that is, it seems to me, an unacceptable basis to draw a constitutional line.
i think in a case like that   i mean, obviously, this court's recent decision in johnson would suggest that   that the prison officials are in a difficult position there and i think they could not accede to that request. and i think complying with the equal protection clause in that context would itself be a compelling interest under the statute. and i think this court in widmar against vincent, for example, suggested that avoiding establishment clause problems is a sufficient compelling interest. i would think equally avoiding the equal protection clause violation in that context would also be a compelling interest, and i don't think there would be a least restrictive alternative. and so i think that the statute   there would be no statutory violation in refusing that particular accommodation. i think there   these show that there are ways to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of the decisions of local prison officials but also does make sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these claims for religious exercise.
without any clue  
and the  
well, first  
that is correct, your honor.
well, it   i think, justice kennedy, though  
we should have objected to the failure to reinstate the equal pay act claim. we didn't; we didn't think it was that important and the time because we still had the title vii claim.
you think   do you think congress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly and non-sloppily what it means if we find for the government here or if we find for the   i mean, for   for the side that the government supports or if we find for the other side?
may i ask you one question, mr. frederick? because it's important to me. would you agree that a complaint that alleged that the defendant negligently used or employed manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by slusa   would preempt it?
that's possible. that would be  
precisely.
the reality is that a straightforward federal lawsuit and a federal rule that these   these reimbursement provisions are straightforwardly enforceable through federal claims means that they will   the reimbursement will be collected efficiently and correctly.
in a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the christian versus jewish and so on. wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?
regardless of whether we knew what we were doing, we said it. [laughter.]
i thought there was a separate severability. didn't it have a severability provision?
but those   those are judgments about facts that they are finding. they are not judgments about probable cause or the moment at which the warrant becomes valid.
  whether he has a good constitutional claim here i guess is rather doubtful  
yes, but logically, if you have established a rule for closing arguments, you established it, you then say it is applicable to the penalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be completely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty phase closing arguments.
that's correct, your honor. it would make paragraph 6(3) much more consistent with paragraph 8(2), if   if the  
well, i'm quite sure   not quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. and now a few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is, it couldn't have been that good. or maybe she thinks that that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now. what's the line? suppose she thinks of it a second from now. suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal, she thought, oh, my god, a pistol is not a shotgun. of course, it isn't. i know that. i better change it. is it a second from now? is it she can never change it no matter what once the pen leaves the paper? what's your rule?
that's what they said, but   but when and how do we decide that? there's another offense under 922(g)   or under 922 that makes it a crime to give a false answer on a   a firearms questionnaire when you go to buy the gun   buy the gun. now, what does the individual do? does he say to the firearms dealer, do you have a list of countries where our government has decided it's a fair enough system that i can say no   yes, i have a conviction in view of the list that it's an unfair system so i can say yes, i have no   or no, i have no convictions? i mean, it   one of the reasons where we employ, for example, the rule of lenity, is   is a person put on notice of what it is that's criminal and what is not. when does it come up that the system isn't fair enough to count?
justice scalia, i  
of course.
because?
so all this was at a time before penry was decided.
you mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those   those regulations   those provisions that were adopted by congress pre-chevron and those adopted by congress post-chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give skidmore deference to, and the ones after chevron, we're going to treat differently. do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?
but i'm   i'm trying to understand what you meant in your brief when you said if the dog had been in gillette's car when gillette stopped caballes, the situation would have been different.
yes, if we're looking for that.
so we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, i don't suppose?
  in raich.
can it   with respect to the reasonableness aspect, in turner versus safley, we said prison administrators have a good deal of latitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain order. now, do you see the reasonableness requirements of the disabilities act as being congruent with the turner-safley reasonableness analysis?
yes, but we  
but what would be if it were not? what would be the lesser-included offense?
i don't   that's only a stretch to answer   answer justice breyer's question.
right.
yes, your honor. of course, we believe that  
i don't mean their view. i mean, they start a lawsuit. they say, "we're   we want"  
well, but you do have cases where a complaint is filed seeking to be a class action and then the district judge does not certify the class and the case, nevertheless, goes forward. now, why couldn't you do that here?
but, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction.
well, the   the purpose of using certified mail is to make sure that it actually got to the person  
i  
one peril was a collision with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened here.
and the question is whether joining the school group, intentionally joining the school group, going there because the school group was there, whether that places him in school.
what   what do you mean by that? you said a second ago the secretary had the option to reprogram. what do you mean by reprogram?
there is a distinction between them but i think they are complementary rules and in the next case the government will argue for a presumption that is precisely what you have articulated, justice souter. a greater and more extensive and more persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go from the guidelines range.
thank you, counsel.
may i suggest you might have put the high threshold because it's a threshold that judges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to inquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted to demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for when a judge is required to demand a   what does   what does reason to inquire mean? is that a   is that a standard that   that can be applied in law?
  coerced.
but   but isn't   isn't the difficulty with your analysis there, general, that, yes, she started out by   by talking about youthfulness. as i understand it, she started out talking about youthfulness and the   and the demeanor, the rolling of the eyes.
i think that the statute is plain and says that the debtor may convert.
  you another question here? there   there were three charges against your client, as i understand it. unlawful possession of a firearm. that's the one we're talking about.
did the defendant here ask to be   to have the right to reopen?
is there anything in the statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be paid as it   to   to make it analogous, say, to withholding where you might have to pay every quarter on   by a certain day? does   does the statute regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of the policy agreement?
i guess the government can't enforce   cannot enforce these contracts either. right? i mean, you take the good with the   the bad with the good?
okay.
trial worthy under preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong inference standard?
it is because  
then why did the   the district judge says four on the state's list have been exhausted?
then i guess it's waived unless it's jurisdictional. so we're back to the jurisdictional question.
that's right. but they would have historically going back to '68 and before, we always intended this to just cover domestic situations.
no. so we're not dealing with that. we're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section. and you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the government to pay for some kind of core federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.
no. i   finish your answer.
what do you think about the possibility, "it depends on the clothes and depends on the equipment," so that, in steiner and here, it's a lot of protective gear, it's really quite part of the job and special and unusual. in mt. clemens, it's a kind of uniform. it's just washing your hands up, putting on an apron. so, where it's minor putting on clothes, as someone might in his house, doesn't come in substantial, doesn't come in integral and indispensable; but where it's quite a big deal, it does. and who decides? the agency.
but it is the case under the test you're submitting to us.
.310 is   is the definition of deadly weapon. the other one   excuse me   .125  
well, your honor, it says   it's part of the cost to the parents. and unlike section 1980, this language is not, contrary to the previous submissions to the court, identical to the language in 1988. it says that a court may award attorneys' fees as part of the costs to parents, and the  
well, i guess my concern actually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in light of what's happened, than with the guilty plea. and i suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivably he's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.
well, i don't think rfra does override it. what rfra does is take the compelling interests that the government already has in enacted laws or treaties, as they are, and then you apply   you apply rfra to them. and that's  
excuse me.
yes.
but, your honor  
ms. blatt  
i think, your honor, that "knowingly" means, in this context   just as it means "knowingly intimidate," "knowingly threatened," "knowingly corruptly persuade"   that means that you have to know that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate their duties, to violate the law. you have to know that it's corrupt.
this instruction basically advises the jury to do precisely what philip morris argues before this court it cannot do and that is to take into account the harm suffered by others in determining this disparity.
counsel, you don't dispute that ferc could impose the same conditions that maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of ferc authority.
from the point of view of the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid criminal responsibility.
no, no. but in my case, it's a post-petition action.
that i   i do not know. i assume so. they have procedures in place, but that i do not know.
of course, that may be true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation that the defendants have agreed not to compete with one another is not a statement of fact?
mr. chief justice, no. he has to impose the middle term. he can't deviate  
they   they could have, though the evidence was that   and the trial court found that it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have heard it or probably would not have heard it.
to follow up on the earlier question of the chief justice, by whom do you understand the services have to be rendered within the meaning of the act?
  and the  
is that all in judge bryson's decision? i certainly didn't see it there.
thank you, mr. pincus. general clement, you have three minutes remaining.
but there is at least   there's got to be some way to tell whether it even addresses the disease. that is essentially a threshold effectiveness question.
you're telling us that one is more important than the other, but there's no textual basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.
or he finds it in what he thinks is within 60 days of when he should have found it. he files his state post-conviction application. after years of litigation, the court says, you know, you really should have found it 59 days ago, not 60.
well, they're similar, because it   ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket. we realize that. but, unless there is a claim that its taxing authority, as such, is being threatened or interfered with, i don't quite see why a preemption theory that rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the analysis.
yes, and  
i suspect there are many ways, mr. chief justice, but not by throwing them out on a jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the lawsuit.
it emanates   it emanates solely from the house conference report.
no.
that's correct, because there's some puddles on the land occasionally.
right.
so, your theory would be if you had a religious group that   whose doctrine was that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that, and distributing hoasca, that the government should be in a position of saying, "this religious group can use it, but that religious group can't"?
  the hypothetical, we're  
well, the bureau of indian affairs has recognized the tribe all along. that is, under the treaty of canandaigua, the federal government was required to pay annuities and treaty cloth to the six nations, and the federal government has done that continuously since the beginning. so we've always recognized this to be a tribe. and i think you're   you've put your finger on an important point, justice breyer, in that the court, in oneida ii, said that it hoped that congress would fix the problem, and thought that it would, but said even if congress doesn't legislate a solution, the suit can go forward. the court contemplated that equitable considerations could be taken into account in formulating a remedy, but it certainly didn't contemplate that the tribe, at the end of the day, would be left without any remedy at all. and, as you point out, if the tribe can sue for damages, it seems farfetched to think that it wouldn't be able to reassert the tax immunity that  
well, it allows suit against either municipalities or states, state or local governments. right?
yes, justice stevens. that would be appropriate on remand. i reserve the balance of my time.
well, if there were letters of credit, why is zurich injured? because the letters of credit were not large enough to cover the premium liability?
and that gets us back to acid rain.
  not be a   characterized as an in rem action? he's seeking back the property he gave over.
may i ask you just one thing  
rule 17 is about joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.
it would be a matter of the defense raising sudden provocation. and i don't believe that they   they certainly didn't put on anything about culpable negligence. for example, maybe he was spinning the gun in his hand for culpable negligence. they didn't put on anything about deliberate design because he didn't want to testify. his defense was alibi and so he didn't take the stand and say, i intended to kill this person, therefore, give me the murder instruction. he's got to put on evidence to support it, and i don't believe he put on sufficient evidence for either of those. and   and i was the district attorney who tried this case, so factually i   i remember the   the   my argument was that we couldn't have proved murder if we had wanted to because there was no premeditation.
if   if you go   i thought vessel   the word vessel appears in our cases. it doesn't appear in the jones act. am i right or not about that?
so there was no lack of notice; there was no surprise.
no, but   no   no question. that would be an easier case. but why shouldn't we require an exhaustion for those two reasons and maybe others?
well, unless the court specifically granted to the litigant a specific period of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do not ignore what the court says. at least i think as, you know, anyone   if this court said that, you have a right to reasonably rely on what the court said. and it certainly wasn't an unreasonable period of time that the court was giving in the case. it wasn't  
well, but it's basic commerce clause analysis that a state has no interest in what happens to the product out of state. baldwin versus seelig.
but it would still be in south carolina.
but known.
well, but of course what the lower courts are doing may or may not be right as a matter of florida law, but that's not before us really.
that is correct, your honor, though the vote technically, of course, is a vote to approve the conference report. that is the final vote congress took on this legislation. the vote was a vote to approve the conference report, which contains four pages   three pages of text and three pages of explanation.
right. so, i mean, i   i think on questioning, you know, we   we haven't been pushing that issue.
well, yes, but there's kind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is not there, sure, you'll let the tenant who is there call the shots.
this reason   suppose, hypothetically, i would think   well, the rule should be no buttons. no buttons, no signs, no banners. a courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a demonstration of any kind. now, if i were to think that, and i also were to think it's just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence, suppose i thought both of those things. now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side says: one, you're supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law. two, if you're worried about the future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law either because of a, aedpa, and b, the case that was cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. all right. you write for me the words i'm supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
well, justice stevens, in many many chapter 7 cases, in many many bankruptcy cases, you have creditors, most of the creditors may hold claims of $500, $1,000, $3,000. this case is unique because there happened to be a creditor, citizens bank, who was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars who had an interest in pursuing the case. in many other cases   that's why   one of the reasons why we have a chapter 7 trustee, to represent the interest of myriad small claimants who collectively have no individual incentive to really incur all the costs to monitor the system. by converting the case from 7 to 13, disenfranchising that representative of all the creditors, the debtor who wants to play the game of concealing the assets, and catch me if you can, can in essence get away with it. this bankruptcy judge understood this. this bankruptcy judge denied the conversion so we would keep the case in chapter 7, the chapter 7 trustee could do his job, collect the assets  
well, there's   there clearly is a line beyond which the state cannot go, and that's what justice brennan was talking about in his concurrence in lydon. he said the   the state cannot fashion a procedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and in   in kepner, this court held that the philippine procedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a bench trial also violated the constitution. so state procedure does not control. it is sufficient but not necessary. if   if you comply with state procedure to say this is   this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal. if you do not comply with state procedure, it can still be an acquittal under federal law.
take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure. michigan has a law, i assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the consumer all this information. would that conflict with the authority of a national bank?
you think   you think there's no difference where really very questionable evidence about some third party's guilt is   is produced in a case where   where the state's case barely makes it over the   over the line to get to the jury and you think it's   it's the same call where that barely questionable third party evidence is   is put in in opposition to a state's case that is   is watertight   i mean, you know, forensic evidence, all sorts of proof. you   you think the two have to be treated the same.
and if  
i   i  
i mean, it's truly broader than just conflict preemption.
you prove monopoly power plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.
well, but that's the   they are trying to contend that they are one and the same. but they can't have their cake and eat it, too.
it would? i thought  
it was made in the senate. so the house presumably never saw the prior  
in the situation that we have here, your honor?
why shouldn't we do what the solicitor general proposed, that is, since we don't know for sure, at least i don't know for sure, i'm not enough of a scientist  
yes. we  
well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. it was addressed that way by the ninth circuit because  
that may be. that may be. but it seems to me that that's a different argument from saying rogers requires it, because i don't think you can get that out of rogers.
it was the same habeas proceeding. it was a continuation of the same. it was then remanded back to the district court. the district court granted the writ on this ground and then it went up on appeal. i don't think he would have been under any obligation to appeal it again, having sort of gotten a ruling on that in the same habeas proceeding.
well, again, we believe that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that (b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730. the   justice souter asked a question about statistics and the frequency with which the claims are litigated together. in a review of court of appeals decisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions actually involving a 3730(h) claim. of those, in 32 the qui tam   a qui tam claim and a retaliation claim were paired. they were litigated together. in only 5 were both a qui tam action and retaliation claim brought, but brought in separate litigation. so 32 to 5 is the relevant comparison there.
yes, your honor. i would say that the third circuit decision in the philadelphia litigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a building in order to gain access and they ended up killing 11 people. the court found that that was not deadly force because the officers were trying to gain access to the building and they reasonably believe that they were able to do that without the loss of life. i think that if that definition were applied to this case, then i think that this would not be deadly force. but i think  
well, penry was considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in graham versus collins, though.
  and he gave me the opposite answer.
all right. what   what  
justice souter's question highlights an ambiguity in this ninth circuit opinion, for me anyway. do you understand the hearing that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation evidence that he now wants to present?
i disagree, your honor. if   if you look at the treaty's text, it says, you shall notify the person affected of his rights. it's referring to the foreign national specifically. and twice more, article 36(2) talks about the rights that are created. these all flow directly to the foreign national. he decides whether to exercise them. this is a classic rights-creating piece of   it's not a   it's not a statute, but it's treated on par. and if you look at the  
yes, ma'am. but they're all memorable. (laughter.)
what's   what's your best answer to the government's argument that unless you treat this case differently from zadvydas, at least for purposes of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects time, the united states is basically defenseless against countries that   that want to dump undesirable aliens and force them into the united states?
does he have to file a new filing fee?
  the recidivism rate gone down in the years since the reyes decision, since this is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable suspicion?
okay.
"you do not face the death penalty."
the  
but, you know, that's   that's one of the   one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form.
clear and convincing.
thank you, mr. savrin. the case is submitted.
  they have to doff the other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back. wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is excluded?
that's correct. this was   this was a   an adjournment that was requested by mr. zedner's first lawyer for the stated purpose of investigating whether the onited states bond, supposedly issued by the ministry of finance of usa, was genuine. the court, having already obtained a purported waiver of a speedy trial for all time, granted the continuance, but made no order of excludable delay, as it had done previously, made no  
well, a couple things. first of all, the   the bar to state law tort suits is in 2679(b), which was passed in 1988, 42 years after the judgment bar and the   and the bulk of ftca. it was passed as an express effort to overturn this court's decision in westfall, which held that employees did not have immunity from state law   certain state law torts. and in the findings that are incorporated into section 2 of the statute, congress specifically called 2679(b) an immunity provision, and this court has since recognized that, for instance, in gutierrez de martinez. there is no comparable legislative history indicating immunity for   for   under 2676. so i   i don't think it's that complicated to figure out now whether someone is proceeding   whether the claim arises   whether the claim to appealability, whether the defense arises under 2679(b) or under the judgment bar because they just really get at very different things. and the courts haven't shown   there's not a lot of case law in either direction, but the   the courts haven't exhibited much confusion about that. the other thing is that when you're   when you're construing the scope of the judgment bar, it's important to remember that this was passed in 1946, and it was intended   at that time some 25 years   35 years before bivens, what the   what congress was getting at was state law suits against the employees versus state law suits against the united states. and the effort was to shift the liability to the united states. that effort to shift liability, yes, was for morale, to protect employees from being distracted, but that   that was, again, the purpose of the shift of liability, the waiver of sovereign immunity in general. the only real explanation of the judgment bar appears in the background of where the drafters explained that the bar is intended to   as a bar to   bar to further suit not only against the government, as would have been true under the prior bill. this is around page 14 of my brief, the quote from   from the 1945 report. not   a bar to liability not only against the government, as would have been true under the prior version, but also against the employee. and there was no bar to suit in the prior version of the bill. so the drafters' explanation could only have been referring to the normal operation of res judicata. and this court has used res judicata in digital as sort of the quintessential example of a defense that is not subject to immediate appeal.
doesn't the answer to my question turn largely on the age of the fetus? isn't it a vast difference between the kind of decision the mother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the one hand and 26 week fetus on the other?
and he says, i'm sorry about that bad faith business.
not a question concerning united states law.
so then your answer to my question is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility, they could continue to seek damages on an active-inducement theory.
thank you, general clement. the case is submitted.
so in a way you really are arguing waiver i think.
the common law would give damages in a case like this in which the release was basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to do one way or the other with the innocence of that person?
sure.
do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the sentencing reform act was adopted? you remember those days.
but it's preemption to rechannel. and that's the important point, justice scalia. the point was not to allow state-law claims under state-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into federal court. and if there are a category of victims of frauds who have no federal remedy, it doesn't make sense to infer that congress, without saying so, left those people without any remedy whatsoever.
in   in this court's case, if i can answer your, the principle of your question, your honor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not the proper analysis here because the specific controls the general.
well, it does, your honor.
i  
in one instance, it was because of attorney abandonment. in other cases, it was because the prisoner was indigent.
that's right.
it could already be charged  
but   but she's totally convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor. and i'm not suggesting bad faith.
  been  
counsel, your time is running short. this is very important. i think you misunderstood justice souter's question. he asked you to give us an example of the kansas versus colorado approach as to the 10-year model. you answered him about the interest. could you  
no, no. let me just finish my question.
yes, that is correct. the district court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that use in 1999.
my goodness, that's a long time before.
yes or no.
but how do you   how can you possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says you have to identify the primary function? plus, even if it's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving at the time of the accident, then there's coverage. that doesn't seem to me very bright line.
well, a parolee has conditional liberty. but, at the time of this search, mr. samson was on parole, there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing  
well   and if this court  
absolutely, your honor. i think that what this court established in williamson county is a two separate litigation scheme. the first litigation concerns state compensation, and the second litigation concerns the federal takings claim.
i have a warrant  
but one of the   if we're going to continue with that analogy to someone who says i won't make discovery, is not just an inference but that you take what the opposing party says to be true on that issue.
well, why wouldn't the jury conclude   why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?
yes.
i  
well, why couldn't you do the same?
and that's in   yes, that's in title 28, as well. and with respect to the term "defendants," justice ginsburg, congress has often used the term "defendants" even in the context of administrative actions. the stockyard and packers act of 1921   it's in 7 u.s.c. 210   actually talks about a complaint against a defendant for damages, all adjudicated before the secretary of agriculture, and that was 85 years ago. it seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one can be a defendant, the person who defends before an agency, as well as the defendant  
right.
and that's a good deal different. whatever the majority might have said about other issues, it certainly was not binding on the court of appeals, was it?
  or make some changes in it? i just don't understand.
that's correct. and the conditions of supervision that the government can impose are much lengthier and could be even more onerous than the kinds of supervision conditions after prison that the government could impose on its citizens. in this case, mr. martinez and mr. zadvydas both received permission to live here. both committed crimes. both served their sentences and both were ordered removed. nothing in section 1231(a)(6) warrants making mr. martinez wait for removal in a federal prison perhaps for the rest of his life, while mr. zadvydas awaits removal after having been released  
that's correct.
but you could say the same thing about diversity jurisdiction, that congress contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no federal question jurisdiction. i mean, i don't see what that proves.
with regard to the first question your honor posed, it's not sufficient for the district court to simply state conclusions, which is what happened in this case, that  
you then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part. and then you say you've argued that here. so what you're saying is now we're supposed to decide, should instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. that's what it is. i have to admit, i didn't quite get that out of the blue brief. i thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence. but you're not now, you say, arguing about railroad negligence. you're arguing about plaintiff negligence.
well, that's just not true, with all due respect. i mean, they   the   we don't verify the accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement, both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to use the epa label, clearly extends to efficacy. and you can have disuniform context whether it's safety or efficacy. imagine a label that directs a product to be mixed for 20 minutes. one jury could find the label was false because the product should have only been mixed for 10 minutes. another jury in the same courthouse could find the label was false because the product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes. and this case is another really good example. now the petitioners are saying the label says that the soil only should be a 7.2 level. their expert says  
your time is short, so could you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you can go and not   and be within the safe harbor?
no, your honor, it doesn't. the treaty on its terms appears to disestablish the reservation entirely. gillett's statement could perhaps be read as a subsequent gloss on that treaty to assure the indians that they won't be forced off their land, the 5,000 acres that they continue to occupy, perhaps because since new york was not a party to the treaty, there couldn't be any explicit session language in the treaty. new york was the only entity that had a right to buy that remaining 5,000 acres because it held the right of preemption. so it may have been that the oneidas wanted to ensure that they could reach reasonable terms. and they did. they sold almost all of that land within the following six years after proclamation of the treaty. so the contemporaneous history squares with that. it's very similar to what happened in santa fe, in which this court said there was a reservation that was created for the santa fes, there was some indication of acceptance of that reservation, and that acceptance was sufficient to terminate the tribe's sovereignty over any lands outside of the reservation that was provided to them, even though many of them did not in fact remove to that land. here the oneidas received much more. not only did many of them sell the lands and leave immediately but they received the benefit of their bargain by recovering compensation for the kansas lands from this court in new york indians.
it is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the american people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the american people. and our traditions show that there is nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. i mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to express its belief that government comes from god, which is what this is about. as justice kennedy said, turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you.
but it  
it   it's the case that a company that does only intrastate michigan business logs all of its miles on   in michigan. right? no miles outside of michigan.
and we would submit that it is second and successive because it's seeking to revisit that adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non-technical procedural basis.
accepting your earlier construct where there really are essentially two rules, we either delay accrual or we  
our position is it would be paid to the child. the child would be the party that could bring that claim. and i just would like to clarify. if you look at page 153 of the  
well, justice ginsburg, as i understand the record, the first effort to broadcast this ad was on, i think, july 26th, and that was sort of a few days before the   the cutoff period would kick in. so there was an effort by a matter of weeks to broadcast this ad. but i think, you know, whether one views that as setting the stage for this litigation or being kind of an independent decision, i'll   i'll leave to others. what i think is important, though, is that although they were engaged on this issue before then, up until that point, they had found it perfectly satisfactory to engage on the issue without engaging in broadcast advertisement.
well, it is   the operative fact   what makes it actionable is that the statements were introduced at trial.
and what you're hearing, i think, is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect to which there was no discrimination in price. so, he is a purchaser of that commodity. you see, "commodity" could refer to the kind of thing   volvo trucks   or it could refer to the particular thing   this truck. and i want to know how you read the literal language.
but   but you're telling us that you don't have the intent to   to yield and   and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you. right? that just doesn't   i just don't think it's true.
it   it does say that he was relieved.
yes, sir, and that's why i would submit to the court it distinguishes  
the court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?
i don't   we're not saying that.
well, they have the same first-amendment right.
not the number of states.
where   where do we find the waiver here? is it in the joint appendix?
he did.
but if the law in oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what philip morris has already paid out in punitive damages?
yes.
so you didn't mean this particular depiction of the ten commandments?
  not necessarily.
so our issue as far as you're concerned   and i'll ask the government the same question   is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of a, b, c, d indian reservations, et cetera? and your claim is, i can't find any difference. and their claim is there will be some difference. is that right?
  circumstances.
thank you, ms. millett. ms. brinkmann, we'll hear from you.
where   where does that appear?
but i'm   i don't   i'm not sure that i agree with you that rule 11 applies. it really deals with frivolous actions. and here, we're talking about the imposition of reasonable costs, are we not? just costs.
even   even if michigan doesn't, i mean, that has nothing   as i understand it, that   that doesn't affect the   the answer to the federal question that we have because, as i understand it, we   we can   we can take as good law that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock authorization, if the police have a justification for going in without knocking, so far as the fourth amendment is concerned, the search is still good.
the   the legislature   if   if the law is overturned and the tenth circuit is affirmed, the legislature might go back in then and address the problem and they might come up with some solution as they did back in 1980 when it became apparent to them that they had set up a system where libertarian candidates couldn't be candidates for state office because they couldn't be affiliated with a party with 6   for 6 months. they made the change that is set forth in the statute that allows 15 days after the party is recognized. it might very well be that a possibility the legislature could pursue that could solve this problem, a problem created by the state of oklahoma, would be to allow a period of time after a party is recognized for voters, not just candidates, but for people who just want to vote in the primary to change. that might be one solution. or it might be, as in the state of new hampshire, where they allow that if it's a newly recognized party and we recognize that all these people in the state never had the opportunity to register in this party, then they will have an open primary there. so i don't think there's one solution for this problem, and i think when the law, hopefully, is held to be unconstitutional as it applies to libertarians, then the oklahoma legislature can come in and perhaps remedy the situation then. now, this   this case is one in which there are some other factors that have to be considered, and that is the importance that is put on first amendment rights to political association. the state of oklahoma, contrary to the brief of the petitioners, has not been overburdened with minor political parties. it is a state in which only in presidential elections, by petitioning, have parties even been able to gain ballot status. the state has also a very severe   the trial judge in this case found that the retention requirement of 10 percent for every general election for the top of the ticket was very difficult. the finding was that the registration here was among   very limited and among the most difficult. and finally, the state has imposed, i think unwisely, primaries on these small political parties. but other than the libertarians and the reform party, there have been no other minor parties on the oklahoma ballot. in this situation, we have to say to ourselves, as the trial judge in fact commented on, is whether or not the law is simply the result of the concerns of the major parties. i do not think that the state legislature in oklahoma went out of its way to try to interfere with the rights of libertarians. i just think that they never really considered them, and that is why this court has said on a number of occasions that when the rights of independent voters and small parties are impacted by legislation, that this court should exercise more strict and careful scrutiny there because  
yes.
well  
absolutely not, your honor, because  
it might have been prepared by the respondents here.
what  
i'm sorry, do   maybe i misunderstood your question.
well, except that we do know that   that affidavits, i agree, would have been prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of testimony, indeed, that was enumerated in crawford and that was kept out at the founding. and that falls into a very well-defined category.
to help answer the question, though, in that context, donnelly and darden set down some general considerations that, while not exclusive, help provide the post and beams of the fundamental fairness standard. so even assuming that all of the statements were improper, those considerations when applied to this case show that the trial was not rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument. first, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor did they misstate the law.
i'm just saying no more so than   than when congress enacted diversity jurisdiction. it intended it to apply, you know, uniformly.
it describes part of it, your honor.
  the reasonably likely to deter test that you referred to, justice breyer. if the court disagrees with our submission that the statute should be written in pari materia, then as we said in our brief, we think that that is the next best test to adopt. but   but the court should   it should be clear to the court how much broader that test is than the material adverse action test.
well, if the utility is   if the utility is privately owned  
your honor, since this is an injunction, he is allowed to consider the evidence that he heard, since he was sitting in an equitable matter. and so, there were actually two presentations  
the difference is, is in the instance of clearfield trust, you had the government involved in a dispute over their own commercial paper that they issued and a uniquely federal interest and a uniquely federal item. here, these   federal employees aren't the only employees in america who get health benefits, and they are   these disputes that arise under this statute are most frequently not of the   not seeking to answer the grand questions. they're most frequently involved in dealing with issues such as we have here. whether the  
no. mr. fitzgerald and mr. vogler, justice o'connor, are the attorneys. they were   they  
well, generally there are about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a good credit history is generally regarded as responsible, and responsible people tend to make less claims. and so, again, it's just one factor of 15 though.
but it's not operating at a loss.
mr. olson, may i ask you to go one step beyond that on an issue of fact that i just don't understand from reading the briefs? let me give you three quick quotations. first, the court of appeals opinion contains this statement, "an expert on behalf of the tribe reported that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's station cannot charge prices high enough to allow collection of both the kansas and the nation's fuel taxes." the red brief says, on page 8, "it is undisputed that enforcing the state tax on fuel sold and delivered to the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel tax." finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, "by selling its fuel at market prices, respondent"   the tribe   "is making both a profit and collecting a tax." my question is, do we know, from the record, whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the state tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at market prices?
i know that's a different statute. i'm not saying that the   that the definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that it is a permissible use of the   of   of the term employee benefit plan.
your honor, this court has used the terms "extenuate" and "excuse" as synonyms in boyde and  
that would be  
he satisfies the statute, but i 9 need to point out something that i think is critical to 10 understanding this question. at the end of the day, we're 11 talking about at most six states where this might be at 12 issue. the rest of them either have laches or statutes of 13 limitations. and these are small states. we're talking 14 about a rule  
justice stevens, i think there would be cases   and that might be one of them   that would present difficult questions. under your hypothetical, for example, if the   if it were clear that there were explicit threats  
but, mr.  
and i don't understand why not.
i'm not   i didn't understand your answer to that. you made a much narrower argument there than you're making here.
no, of course, it wasn't in the first trial.
  which   one of our arguments here is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91 and '96, that the '96 act, with respect to a small sliver of collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91 act. however, that is not our only, or even our principal submission. our principal submission has to do with the powerful anti-attachment  
your honor, if   if you look at   if you look at the joint appendix at page 63, the trial judge actually instructed the court   instructed the jury, listing six factors. those six factors are listed in a footnote in ellerth, which you cite favorably as what the standard is   or what the standard is for vicarious liability. so the court   the jury was instructed on material adverse employment action standard. it was tried on the material adverse employment action standard. i argued that the forklift position was materially adverse. the defendant, if you look at the transcript of the closing at pages 48 and 49, didn't even challenge that it was adverse. everybody that heard the proof, common sense told you that when you went from a forklift running things around to pulling out railroad ties, it was adverse. so to answer your question, justice scalia, we traveled all the way up to this court on the material adverse employment action standard, and we won.
no, it doesn't.
that gets back to the point i was trying to make earlier. he came here because it was the school event, the school sponsored activity. he could have gone anywhere along the route. he knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that they were going to be, the students were going to be released to see it. he went to join up with the school even if he were truant that day.
well, it would always be up to the jury to decide that. now, in mr. lopez's case, he was   he was initially charged with a series of offenses that went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he ultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his official   in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs, which was, itself, a trafficking element. and so, this shows that the way the state crimes are defined or applied are often getting at what federal law  
well, wouldn't it have been easier to do that than come to the supreme court of the united states?
all i'm suggesting is just draft it   just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. because subparagraph (i) says picketing cochran or cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.
well, but it's a   see, i want to know what i'm supposed to do. as i read the language, you're out. as i understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in. and maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which i'd certainly read, but is there any supreme court precedent to the contrary that supports you?
justice scalia, there   there are two issues there. in fact, the   the pathologist's testimony and   and the law enforcement officer's testimony is consistent to the extent that the injuries which mr. muncey described inflicting were, in fact, inflicted upon the victim. there were those injuries. the point   the fact that there were additional injuries to the victims   to the victim assumes that somehow mr. muncey's independent, short confession, because, remember, when he started to confess   after he makes this confession, he's rushed out of the home and told that they don't want to hear anything. this isn't a situation like a law enforcement   a confession made to law enforcement where once obtaining evidence of guilt, law enforcement pursues and tries to get as many of the details out of it. i don't believe that it would be   it's significant or it would be significant to any reasonable juror that mr. muncey did not describe every single injury that he inflicted on ms. muncey that night.
it's a compromise. it's a compromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate here. what they want to adjudicate are affirmative defenses to a patent infringement action. that is not a ripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing to make voluntary payments  
right, where you   where the parties have specified. even in other   in insurance law generally, where the parties have specified in the insurance contract how that's supposed to work, then the courts will enforce that. and there's nothing unusual in courts of equity taking a look at the agreement that was reached between a   the parties, presumably supported by consideration, in deciding what kind of relief to grant. that was a traditional function that equity served.
yes.
is there anything in any of these statutes or legislative history or any   anyplace else where congress ever thought of the possibility that some other court might make a new rule retroactive?
the agreement happens at one moment in time.
well, as i was saying, you'd have to amend the articles of association if you move to a different city. so you could look at the articles of association, and those are on file with the comptroller. so i think where a national bank's main office is located is readily identifiable and it's publicly available information.
well, that's not all she said, justice scalia.
i wouldn't agree with it. i thought that the ninth circuit had been very clear that it did not agree with the district court's determination that he had waived mitigating evidence. i thought the ninth circuit simply disagreed with that finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating evidence.
they could have said   if the other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings  
and, in fact, your honor, the equivalence factor in louie is present in this case.
does   does that mean   the no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?
you really think you got to knock even when the door is open.
thank you, mr. strain.
in any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?
they   they could have, senator kennedy.
and that's the way i read dura.
the mandate was not recalled  
well, mr. rosenkranz  
he's also the cheapest master we've ever had. (laughter.)
how about jones, who really did not know who was the doctor who said no surgery? he didn't know and then the prison told him. and he comes to the court, he says thanks, prison, for telling me, and so he names that person in his complaint. the sixth circuit said that's no good, he didn't put it in his initial complaint. he had only 15 days to find out and he didn't find out.
well  
yes, but both place and edmond, opinions from this court, said sniffs are not searches.
yes, but doesn't the reference to tributary make it relatively plain that what the court was getting at was the impossibility of drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect the purity of the ultimate navigable water? and isn't the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an indication that it said if we want to attain the objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of   of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order to reach that objective? isn't that the reasoning that is apparent from what justice ginsburg just   just read to you?
before you   before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine? maybe mr. verrilli should be the one i should ask this, but you must have your   your version of it. how do you decide whether an insurance premium is for work that was done within the last 180 days? how   how do you calculate it, whether that characteristic of the   of the statute is complied with?
sure.
  let's all the evidence on and   and does it after all the evidence is there, and then she   and then at the close of all the evidence, she gives a directed verdict for   for the defendant, and then discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks out, oh, my god, what a mistake i made. too bad. right? i mean, we say double jeopardy.
general clement, do you know how joshua would have been assigned prior to the establishment of unitary status in this case?
tell me if i'm wrong, please, on this.
and it seems to me that that's what you're asking us to do here.
it would be pursuant to the agreement.
yes, your honor, that   and, similarly, we believe that there was standing, and still is standing, for the plaintiffs to be in this court on article iii grounds because of the continuing pendency of our challenge to the property tax exemption as municipal taxpayers. we  
no, because in many states   many states don't allow reimbursement altogether. they have anti-subrogation policies as well, and the reality is, is that what  
the district court did actually entertain this issue, justice breyer, and what they   what the district court found was there wasn't an opportunity, there wasn't a reason for mr. shepard to contest building or any other element of this offense.
is your submission that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're intending a d&e and if you're intending a d&x, they're official the same?
it turns out to be entirely wrong. turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only reason he believed this company was defrauding the government was absolutely wrong.
but  
that's why a knock on the door may not always be the right thing to do. in some cases it could be a futile gesture. in this case, the police announced themselves and were not heard because of that tumultuous  
so you're saying those words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference.
i would think on the question of the charging double, the answer to that question would be no because it would present a traditional, not unique to the ada, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in england and you buy a ticket in england, your ticket is going to be subject to english common   in that case, the english disability law. there is an english disability law. it doesn't discuss cruise ships. it's   but it's broadly written. but with respect to the structure of the ship, i think that english passenger with a disability   say that you come across to the united states and you want to get off in new york. i think that congress clearly intended that that person would be able to come off a   off the dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the wheelchair; while you were in u.s. ports and you're staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your accessible   your accessible rest room, have grab bars. we are   and   and let me not pass too quickly by the fact that even when we talk about some structural changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about things that have nothing to do with   justice o'connor, you focused the name of the treaty is the safety of life at sea. whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has nothing to do with that. whether there is  
what we want to know is what the judge found and ruled upon. the district attorney, as i understand it, has withdrawn the general claim that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that might have been   might   probably was comprehended under youth that   that remains is the claim of no community ties. and i find it very difficult to tell from the judge's ruling whether the judge is saying, yes, i think there's a fair showing that there are no community ties and that's certainly a race-neutral reason. i don't know what the judge was   was  
but this is not about structuring decisionmaking. this is about terminating decisionmaking on the issue that is central to the eighth amendment requirements at the selection stage  
well, i guess the one other concern would be the timing in oklahoma is such that the   the republican or democrat who wants to disaffiliate in order to vote with the libertarians has to do so at a time before the state has decided whether to allow the libertarian party on the ballot. so, you know, it probably isn't burdensome to   in principle, to have some disaffiliation requirement, but does the state have to allow enough time so that the decision can be made with knowledge of whether the libertarians are going to be on the ballot?
that's right. that's right. and perhaps   and this gets back to the chief justice's question as well. it helps maybe to separate these kinds of cases into three categories. we first have the category that the prosecution would prefer not to put the person on the stand. we think there the confrontation clause ought to require them to do so. we   we next have the category where the defendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence. we don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture doctrine kicks in, which this court reaffirmed in crawford. we don't have any forfeiture question in this case. and then we have perhaps the gray area, where a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's, and this court has said over and over again that there the confrontation right puts the onus onto the prosecution.
if we were dealing with a   with a much older criminal statute, the burden might be allocated differently?
yes, but the volume is unique. in other words, there aren't going to, in a typical case, be a lot of witnesses, and the volume is unique. and you can't bring the postal carrier in, two years after the fact, and say, "do you remember where you placed this parcel on this porch on this day?"
well, because  
your honor  
do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of shepard, we need more?
i think the california supreme court and the california legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought. they obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the judge would apply the middle range, not using his own perception as to whether more punishment is justified or not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime that make this person more guilty, and that's what you usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact that you believe the crime should bear   in general, should bear, a higher penalty. i think they would be astounded to find that this is what they have created.
  let me suggest  
no, but we were put in that posture by   by the way the state of florida has chosen to   to vest this total discretion, shroud everything in secrecy, and then complain that we didn't bring it earlier when we  
on that issue?
so if you're going to adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted not only for references back to the state court from a federal decision, but you would surely have to apply it to all state determinations of federal law, and i don't really know what authority we would have to require lower state courts to do that.
that's where i  
and it is not clear. i wish it were because that's precisely what my pro se client wrote in his rule 60(b) motion. he said i have been denied my right to a first petition because of an incorrect determination on the statute of limitations, that the artuz decision makes clear that i was entitled to a tolling period that i was not awarded, and i would like the judgment modified or reopened. and that's as clear as a pro se litigant can make that claim. that's what the claim has been from the very beginning, long before i was ever his counsel.
or maybe they thought that was a problem of ninth circuit confusion rather than jury confusion. [laughter.]
it does, your honor, absolutely. equitable tolling is always available in an extraordinary case when the plaintiff could not put a complaint on file within the period of the statute of limitations. and unlike the accrual question, as indicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the states. in this case, for example, because mr. wallace was only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his claim was tolled. he actually had nearly four years beyond the two-year statute of limitations to put a complaint on file and it still would have been toll   would have been timely. he filed outside even that time. illinois does not toll for prisoners, but many states do, as the court indicated in the hardin case. so there's all sorts of tolling available, or could be under state law. mr. wallace has actually never urged tolling in this case and i assume that that's because there is no basis for that under state law. he did get the advantage already of the time when he was a minor and there is no other basis under illinois law that would allow him any basis for tolling. but of course, tolling is proper when the plaintiff does not know and could not know that his rights were violated. if mr. wallace was illegally seized, he was right there when it happened. he might not have known that a court would ultimately accept his argument on that, but of course the plaintiff never has a right to be told that he has a successful claim before he brings that claim.
identified them all?
  apologize.
that's correct. it  
i thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are.
that's correct, mr. chief justice, and that's extremely important because we would suggest  
  you don't really have to get into whether that judgement is enforceable here. i mean  
  don't you have to address the teague question a little bit? you   you're entitled to this new rule adopted by the court of appeals only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the judgment became final. isn't that kind of a hard argument to make in light of our subsequent decision in brown v. payton?
we believe that when congress  
yes, absolutely.
and i have no dispute with that, justice breyer. i agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. that's the basis of the injunction. and you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to   to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. and i  
no, i've not heard them say that as to north carolina law. but what they're saying is that the michigan mortgage broker, lenders and servicers licensing act and the michigan secondary mortgage act do not apply to them.
  account for its fairness  
but   but the district court's order is clear. and it is absolutely correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed at the outset. so the court does not lack removal jurisdiction. the reference in 1447(c), second sentence to "lacks subject matter jurisdiction," refers to lacks removal jurisdiction. and in fact, this court used that shorthand repeatedly in the kircher decision to describe 1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. this court  
  you're right.
that's flowers.
  the legislature is going to take that up again. and there's simply no consequence to anyone else by affirming the kansas supreme court's decision in this case. the legislature is going to take the matter up again. there's no question about that.
well  
okay, i'll put it differently. all state laws relating to subjects that are covered in the contract are preempted.
i'm sure it was not, your honor. the other thing that one has to look at at the time is what new york state was doing. new york state entered into three similar treaties at the time. one with the oneidas, one with the cayuga and one with the onondaga. those three treaties all terminated aboriginal title in the first provision. the other three tribes of the iroquois were not of concern.
we don't believe  
well, the sec in the lower courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the supreme court, of course, they've   they've urged for a vacator of the lower court decision. and the brief of the sg echoes many of the concerns that the sec expressed in the lower courts.
do we know why the judge apparently changed his mind? because if i remember correctly, at the pretrial hearing, the court said that the defendant would be allowed to, a, wear his own clothes and, b, to have leg braces underneath for security. and then sometime after that pretrial hearing, the judge apparently changed his mind. do we know what triggered that?
and don't they do that by   don't the allegations do that here by claiming that the corporation was manufacturing or providing false social security cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if the   the law got too close to them? i mean, that is not merely the conduct by a corporation of the normal business of hiring and employing people. isn't that the sort of extra that is alleged that takes this out simply of the   of the category of the   of the corporation conducting its own affairs?
  saying they are not dropping in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?
the infringement that happened in the united states which was under section b, which provides section b inducement liability for making copies domestically of   the same thing that happened here. copies of the object code were put on physical mediums and sent to domestic manufacturers. domestic reproduction constitutes infringement under section 271(b) but foreign reproduction is not a violation of section 271(a) or 271(b). hence, we're talking about the two sections where  
let me take a step back because i think there is a confusion here over also the word official punishment. punitive damages do not punish for harm, they punish misconduct. and this is an important distinction because harm is a compensatory concept. you compensate others for harm and of course you cannot compensate others for harm in the course of this case. but you can consider the potential risks, the potential harm and the future harm if this course of misconduct is not deterred.
yes, i haven't looked in detail at the statute of limitations provisions, but that could be the effect. and we could be punishing them much more severely than canada would be. they have their own means of balancing what they think the appropriate balance is for these things, and certainly the wire fraud statute, 57 months in our  
because   as i had gotten that from one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their standard   they say a willful   of willful, deliberate inducement. and that, it seems to me, important that they be able to argue that. now, can they argue it, in your opinion, if we do nothing but affirm the ninth circuit?
which is the text that we're dealing with here.
it's a theoretical proposition  
yet, your honor, we would   i would continue to   to argue that it is not   if it is significant and atypical, it is marginally significant and atypical.
well, they said it's to find out if there's any contraband.
  the prosecutors were well aware of that when they determined to appeal.
the post-removal event here is the recognition of the defendant's sovereign immunity.
yes.
okay. i think it  
well, that would be   that's the respondent's position, and i think, in addition to those considerations, if you disagree that this is a forfeiture, that   and you disagree that this is an express waiver, and you get to their position that, you know, this is a discretionary test and you should just apply the same rule 15 factors, i think you need to also apply a presumption against sua sponte consideration. there's one way to do it under rule 4, and that's the most efficient way. it's also the way that comports with judicial neutrality in the adversary system. and so, to encourage people  
i would   i would think so.
if   if there had been a joint bank account, the succession would have been determined based on the validity of the joint bank account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within the probate exception.
no. it just wouldn't be a question of the doctor's preference. you would have to refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk about including stenberg is not that that the doctor simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be a significant body of medical opinion that says that this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of the mother. now, where that's true, the court has previously said that the constitution protects the right. and i don't see anything in what congress says that wants to change that law. they simply have a different view of the facts. official
but   yeah, i think he's   one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that   you look at the debt collection act, and suppose it had said the following, "section 207 is amended, or changed, as follows. we refer specially now   we can collect, through offset, but only for 10 years. i mean, only to claims that are more than 10 years old. so, we are changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year   under 10 years old, and we can offset those." now, suppose it had said that.
you put me  
i think it can be read either way, although i think even the government's brief in   or the respondent's brief in taylor talks about extortion and burglary being crimes that can be official committed with no risk of physical injury to another person and yet congress still specifically enumerated those  
it depends on what you mean by "regularly constituted." in your brief, i gather you   what you meant is that a court that was pre-existing. it doesn't necessarily mean that. it just   it could mean one that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for the occasion by proper procedures. wouldn't that be a "regularly constituted court"?
you're talking about in this case.
but what about the cases   putting aside the clear-cut case where the employee's statement is either clearly correct or clearly incorrect, but what about the case where the objection to what the employee is doing is the manner of the speech? it's on the matter   it's on the matter of concern, but the supervisor just thinks that it's being handled in a way that's ham-handed or indiscrete. aren't they going to   aren't these cases going to cause terrible litigation problems?
  and not the school district? the school district has a plan that it has put forward. and it seemed to me logical, well, it has a plan, so it should defend it.
and we think   we agree that the oregon supreme court went farther than it needed to in this case in order to decide the issue, because, under oregon law, mom testified  
mr. dreeben, is attempt a lesser included offense of the substantive offense of illegal reentry?
right. and the agencies are identified how? how do we identify the agencies that would be disregarded?
your honor, in this case i believe that the answer is that you would have the same result in state court or in federal court. and the reason i believe that is because section 2 makes the existence of a contract a precondition, and you don't get to anything else if that is not met.
well, but it's a   it's a classic mixed motive case. we don't know when the officer is sitting down with her and asking the questions, whether his primary motive is to make sure the guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is to help make the case against the guy. it's both.
your honor, the retrogression problem was created by the fact that they had gotten rid of a much more natural   naturally occurring  
well, in an ideal world, they would be presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with a   a world where 93 percent of petitioners are proceeding pro se. your honor, stay and abeyance does force a petitioner to present unexhausted claims in state court  
what do you say of the explanation that was given in bazemore? i forget the subsequent case. it was in footnote 6. you know what i mean. which referred to bazemore as a case that involved a present discrimination which, which is inconsistent with your theory. what do you say about footnote 6?
i think at least if you're talking about the extension of the writ to enemy combatants  
it would have some impact on the other creditors, in that you would not be able to augment the estate by collecting a monetary judgment from the state.
none.
and they're worried about the impact  
only because i'm a reasonable man. (laughter.)
yes.
i don't know. i don't remember.
well, but   but wasn't   wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands because of   of the likelihood of an interaction?
even though that position has been widely criticized, i think. is it the ali model penal code, which thinks it's a bad rule?
well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.
well, i   i think if i'm   if i'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and i want to make an evaluation of whether or not i have a claim, i want to first evaluate do i pass a jurisdictional threshold. if a come   a person comes into my office and says, look, this happened to me, i want to bring a cause of action, and i know that they employ less than 15 people, then i'm not going to waste my time.
your honor, the fact that he has absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving testimony in the case.
it's an extreme case for a number of reasons, and that's certainly one of them. there isn't just insufficient  
i thought judge bowman said were it not for aedpa this case might come out   in his view this case might have come out differently.
the response comes back, "i don't think we owe it, and here's why." and then there's a ruling, "you do owe it." and that's the order. and then you can appeal it. and the cfr refers to it as an appeal.
it   it seems to me that the   the facial attack objection would   would not be   carry much weight if what happened was this. there was a trial. the policies were found deficient, and the court said, you devise some new forms. at that point, it seems to me that the facial attack would   objection would   would not be relevant. and   and your point would be right. you say, you know, they   they haven't   this doesn't   is not going to cure the   the deficiency. but what happened here was that, as i understand it, midway in the litigation there was a new policy, and it   it seems   so we have sort of a moving target that we're working with.
but i supposed "miscarriage" does.
well, your honor, the importance of our position, the central thrust of our position is that the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed under 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness constraint. it doesn't matter if factors are required  
and does that have any procedural impediments?
  going to tell me.
well, if   i'm not sure if i understand the question. would you please repeat it?
the california supreme court made no claim to be deciding this case under state rules of procedure. it asserted repeatedly that in this case that it was deciding this question under its understanding of federal law, under its understanding of the batson line of cases, and that it was interpreting federal law and nothing more. my opponent argues that there should be a state law question, but that's a different position than taken by the state supreme court.
well, how could the district court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when the ninth circuit says on a-17, the appendix to the petition, for all the foregoing reasons, landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel?
no, no, no. you say that it could  
the jury has to be given the opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the death penalty. however you want to put that, you know, you can put the burdens here, the burdens there. you can talk about equipoise or not. does the jury have a chance to say this   this fellow does not deserve the death penalty? that  
and you think california would be happy with that?
let's  
that presents a difficult question, justice stevens, as i'm sure you know. [laughter.]
but that   but that's res judicata. i mean, that   that isn't necessarily a   an application of   of any probate exception.
  on   on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call federal functions, that it   every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called federal functions?
why   why any more so   why any   any more so than   than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?
of the foreign? the language of the statute is the foreign manufactured product. those are the computers that are sold abroad. it is our position that the only components that are in issue in this case are the physical manifestations of the object code on a hard drive or on a disk.
thank you, mr. long. mr. crooks, we'll hear now from you.
  bring those types of claims, and win, and then they settle.
that   that gives a lot of power to district   to   to the district judge, doesn't it? i mean, you know, this   he says this   this u.s. attorney really doesn't honestly believe that he's biased, but i think, being the great psychologist that i am, that this united states attorney, or whoever, is   is really biased and   and he's   i   you really  
how long has this test been established?
may i ask just one quick question?
was it an estate plan or a will?
thank you, mr. marcus. mr. long, you have 2 minutes remaining.
even though the entry of those officers was an unlawful entry.
it doesn't seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate. it could be a slight proximate cause.
well, an entry that conformed with knock-and-announce would have been lawful. this entry didn't. this entry was unreasonable. so, i don't see how your argument fits the facts.
  that the   the emergency was resolved, and at that point, he was  
no, i understand that. but i'm just   i'm just pointing out what   what becomes available to you if we   if we give you the relief you request.
there are variations that   the   the most stringent is petitioners' rule, which is we have to be made whole for everything that we wanted to claim, pain and suffering. we thought our claim was $1 million and we didn't settle for $1 million, and therefore, we're not made whole. there is   there is another version that is less restrictive than that, but as long as there is a showing that medical expenses have been paid, you get a return of medical expenses. there are another version   there's another version that is enforced in many states, including virginia and california and i   some others i believe, in which essentially the make-whole runs the other way towards the insurer, that   that you have basically a first dollar type to ensure that the medical expenses are paid first. there are   there are a variety of things, but within the erisa context, every court of appeals that has addressed this has said that when you put these kinds of terms into the plan   and they are very common   we're not going to adopt from various states equitable rules that will contradict the terms of the plan and that will  
just as a matter of curiosity, is the transcript of the plea colloquy still available?
well, that's what it was about, as far as the court's analysis was concerned. to be sure, there were a lot of   there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, "you take it   you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your   to buy it in interstate commerce."
but that's true of the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the corps says we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent to another wetland.
well, your honor, you heard earlier about the   1986, the electric consumers protection act. that did require ferc to give equal consideration to the protection of the environment with respect to the production of   hydropower production. but the states have a responsibility given to them by congress. the states have the primary responsibility for the prevention, for the reduction, and for the elimination of pollution. the way we enforce that is through our water quality standards. and so, the only way we can enforce those standards with respect to federally licensed facilities is section 401. and if you should take that from us, it will create a gaping hole in the clean water act.
right. and we lay this out in some detail in a   in a footnote in our brief. and that's at   that's at pages 39 to 40. but that footnote, i should point out, doesn't deal with your hypothetical, justice breyer, which is that he goes back of   on his own accord. and, i think, in that situation what he would do is what people ordinarily do when they're seeking to gain lawful admission to the country, which is to apply for admission on the basis of what would have been whatever relationships he could have asserted at that point. now, he wasn't married at the time that iirira was enacted, so he wouldn't have used his marriage as a basis for coming in, because he wasn't married as of yet. but i think that cuts more against him, rather than in his favor, because  
thank you general chanos. mr. gornstein, we will hear now from you.
well, that's why i thought your answer would have focused on that rather than the security concerns, is that you take away what it is they want the most because that's most likely to result in them conforming their behavior so they can get it back.
well, then he went on and he said  
no. no, your honor.
no, no, no. i'm sorry, justice stevens. no. only if the defendant is convicted is the remedy a retrial because, indeed, if the jury acquits him, there is no harm at all.
yes.
yes, your honor.
so what again in your view is the best distinction from kyllo?
so that  
i thought he had made those statements about being railroaded before he found out about the lawyer's concession.
yes, but  
well, what it meant in this case, justice alito, is that it meant what, how much did weyerhaeuser artificially increase the log market above where it otherwise would have been? we had several experts and a number of both industry and forest economists testify that for 20-plus years log prices had been following lumber. there was an equilibrium in the market. then you get to  
  wineries.
  where the court  
it's more   it's more than public policy, it's article iii. article iii says that you can bring a lawsuit in this situation. and that was settled  
if i were writing something, should i say on the assumption that it's patentable? since the issue isn't raised?
isn't it interesting, your honor, that what drove 1367 was this court's decision in finley? and what's interesting about the argument that exxon makes here is that finley discussed the words civil action. and in fact, what finley said in civil action is rejected, the very argument exxon makes here  
i have one last question. how do you think professor wigmore would have decided this case? (laughter.)
i hope so. i mean   people  
yes.
in good faith?
that's absolutely correct.
well, there certainly would be a question, though, the way that lear read pope, and under lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge licenses, especially ones like in pope, where they agreed not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would be enforceable. and the government thinks there's a spectrum. one   at one end of the spectrum would be licenses like those in pope, and at the other end of the spectrum would be a consent decree entered after settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where the   which included an agreement not to settle. now, that's clearly not what we have here.
and this is very helpful i think because it gives those three rules, which the court has given us in rhines, helped us and helped the district court to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or reopening proceedings.
your honor, my purpose is not to minimize the monetary interests involved, but it is to focus the court's attention on the aspect of it that congress had focused on. certainly, if we have an erroneous decision either way, there will be some loss. if the loss is on the school system, it will not be unimportant; it will be some money. if the loss is on the child, it will be in the squandering of human potential  
suppose they win every other case in oregon.
if you say your plan has the overwhelming support of the community, does "community" mean those parent who have children in the schools?
but here  
justice scalia, we actually make two claims regarding that. first, that that was a conclusion of law entitled to   entitled to de novo review. second, that  
no, i don't think so, unless  
that's correct. i believe you're referring to either the williams or the walker  
  decisions under the act.
it's the same situation  
i think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. we could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. we probably could have pled california's  
what would you think about the following  
i believe  
it's a handwritten   handwritten by the judge in, in the case. so  
  doesn't that work here?
yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea. and you   saying the active substance isn't there independently, so it's not covered. and that seems to me to be a   an erroneous reading of the treaty.
is the jury given a copy of the information?
mr. van amberg, if there is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant consideration might be how would this work across states, and i think it's true, is it not, that your reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different results from state to state depending on whether they have large districts or small districts at the top and the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils rather than school districts regardless of size, you would get uniformity going from state to state.
well, your honor, if it is definite, then it is certainly not enabling of an actual invention. and here the morse case, which we have cited in our briefs, comes into play. in that case, the court held that samuel morse was entitled to patent his innovative telegraph but he couldn't go further to effectively patent the law of nature or natural phenomenon associated with it and thereby monopolize all manner of devices and processes that he did not invent and did not enable or describe.
i'm sorry.
and was there the constitutional violation he alleges?
what about drug offenders, given the high rate of recidivism?
and, your honor, as far back as preiser, this court has noted that challenges to duration go to the very heart of habeas corpus. that's  
i find that extraordinary.
i think this court's jurisprudence on   on questions of   of lenity and interpreting jury verdicts would allow a jury to return a verdict that   that isn't necessarily supported by the evidence. it's the understanding that it's their  
the claim that was   that we were bringing was under federal law in that we were claiming the arkansas statute was invalid by reason of a anti-lien statute, and we believed that that presented a question of federal law and therefore brought it  
once it's final under state procedure, right? and you also would add once there's no clerical error. she didn't mistakenly say, you know, affirm when she meant to write deny. leaving that aside, once it's final under state procedure, it's final.
the oregon question. that is  
i understand the purposes-of-the-statute argument. the purpose of the statute is always to provide relief to someone who's been injured. and to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden should be on the other side, in order   in order that people who are injured can get relief, is   i mean  
i   i think that it is   it was intended to address mixed motive cases. that's why it was added. i think it is a indicia of the fact that this statute is concerned with intent in its prohibitions only. i'm not saying it's conclusive of that, but i'm saying it's another indicia, that if you look at all of section 4(f), it's about the instances in which age is being used  
the jury can't really find that other people were harmed. the jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person. the most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people. i think a jury could find that. and therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely. but i   you don't  
there is no way to guess that.
of course, justice ginsburg, the venue counts. and here the venue is very important. it is the corner between the texas state capitol and the texas supreme court. and in that way, this monument standing alone does convey the government's endorsement for religion.
the current case today, yes, justice scalia.
one drop.
yes. because a sniff is not a search, a police officer would be able to take a narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her. i can tell you that because of the limited resources   and this is a point brought up in the illinois association of chiefs of police amicus brief   that that is not likely to occur. in addition, i can also tell you that in the state of illinois, the illinois state police do not train their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. they only use them on objects. but yes, in answer to both of your questions, because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs could be used to walk down streets. they could, hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they are used in parking lots.
doesn't the assignment allow you to bring a lawsuit?
thank you, mr. fisher. mr. englert?
have you found any other instance in which   any case   there was a absolute lack of standing, prudential standing, but the court waived that, because it was prudential and not constitutional?
didn't we take one in abood?
no, i'm not sure i understood that answer. so, in this situation, if the employer said that mr. ceballos was performing his job poorly, that would be enough to tip the balance in the employer's favor  
i don't think that's the issue before the court, your honor. i think what we're looking at is whether he   the jury had a fair opportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not to do or what the statute forced him to do. the fact is when the state courts looked at these claims in 1994 and 1999, this evidence was much more like graham than it was like penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide that there was no penry error in these cases because of that fact. and i think it's worth mentioning that if that's not the case, then i think we've arrived at the point where penry has swallowed the rule announced in jurek 31 years ago and it   to which it was only supposed to be an exception.
yes. there   but there's   in other words, i've got your definition and all i've tried to do is create a circumstance where, while it fits your definition, it's made by a person that is in the conspiracy. so i make him undercover, the law enforcement officer.
it's not our position, your honor, that   that the trial court can make credibility determinations, but  
yes. i think  
but they   they go beyond the reference to rights as   as in article 36.
i think the real bottom line for the   your opponent is that even a pure election ad should get the same constitutional protection as an issue ad, which is something we've rejected.
didn't we   didn't we also go further and say one reason to construe it that way is official we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to establish   you know   the facts of old trials. there was an administrability analysis involved. i think there was. yeah, i wrote shepard. and i think that's what  
that's   i keep doing official this. i'm sorry. is that sufficient, as you understand it, under the washington case that your brother cited to me?
and is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?
it is on one  
the basis for the tax immunity here is that this land does not have indian country status. for this land to have indian country status, it has to be, in our view, under this court's venetie decision, federal set-asides and federal superintendence. if you look at how the oneida indian nation got this land in 1997, it wasn't because of any set-aside by the federal government in 1794, even if there was, and i will get to that later.
so you're saying he's going to have this. i want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.
but you have another factor here that wasn't present in mullane; that is, the person who received notice has a statutory obligation to advise government of the current address. the people involved in mullane had no such obligation to notify anybody of their current address.
yes, inside it  
what about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, i've got a job now. i can pay off my debtors   my creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under under 7. that's a benefit to everybody.
and in enacting section 1291, congress specified that only final decisions would be appealable.
may i ask this question? would the case be any different if, instead of a tax credit, they offered a cash subsidy?
well, under the statute congress  
  of   of predicate act  
i think it's pretty clear you don't talk of something as being in the chair. it's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair. i assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.
you see, you're   you're saying  
but the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is california law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory? you would acknowledge this?
he's a real party if you sued him.
that's   that's what makes it different from private contracts  
in this case.
excuse me. and this was the congress that enacted what?
well, if it's never   i   i  
we did not plead it with particularity. we pled that the employer sexually harassed the plaintiff, and then thereafter in the pretrial order, it was not raised as a contested issue of fact. and i believe the law of the case doctrine would control in that instance because the  
  that says the   in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die, and that's painful. and then it's been suggested there are ways around that. just give them more sodium pentothal or have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the individual is unconscious at the time that the death-causing drugs take effect. all right. now, that doesn't seem too difficult. maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem too difficult. so why can't they think, you know, florida   they can read there too. they have people who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just do it. they don't have any real interest in   in causing suffering. why don't they just do it? and so he thinks, up until the last minute, that maybe florida will just do it, and lo and behold, when the death warrant is actually executed, it now begins to appear that they won't. and therefore, at that time, he brings the case. now, i've spun out a story which seems probable, but if it's true, it would be very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is. now, what is your reply on the ripeness question?
i think it is wrong on the facts and on the law. if it was obvious all along this is an affirmative defense under section 282 of the patent code, that must be pleaded. one certainly can't be excused for failing to plead something that, dare i say, is obvious. but let's deal with the morse case. mr. franklin said it's the same statute at the time. actually, that is not so. at the time morse was decided, section 112 and 101 were both together in section 6 of the 1836 patent act. in 1870, congress broke that off. that's important because in diehr, this court considered a similar issue with respect to the novelty requirement and concluded that once congress consciously wrote the novelty requirement out of section 101, it was inappropriate to inject, you know, the novelty considerations into section 101. the second answer to the morse question, justice breyer, is that the test for definiteness is not is this definite in the abstract, but is it really too broad in relation to the inventive contribution as disclosed in the specifications. and the contrast here that is important to keep in mind is between morse in 1854 and alexander graham bell, claim 5 of that patent. just to set it up, in the morse case, claim 8, it had been known for many years that it was possible to transmit using the electromagnetic current but nobody knew how. and in fact, this court's ruling on page 107 says this was known by men of science everywhere. and the problem was that morse discovered one particular way to transmit characters at a distance and tried to patent everything that everybody might ever discover using whatever means to print at a distance. alexander graham bell is a good contrast. claim 5. it was also known that you could use the electronic current to transmit voice. people had tried and tried and tried and, in fact, there was somebody in germany who successfully transmitted music but not words. this is all in   in the court's opinion. now, graham bell discovered that the key was to use continuous undulations in current. continuous undulations, not discontinuous undulations. and had a patent claim, claim 5, which was very broad. all users of continuous undulations to transmit voice or sound. the court said that's absolutely right, because he was not trying to claim beyond his inventive contribution to the art. now, drs. stabler and allen in this case discovered something very important which is all of the medical tests that existed in the art as late as the 1880s   the 1980s were wrong. people were horribly misdiagnosed. and there was a test that existed but nobody used. this is what the record was. the test for existing homocysteine was almost never used, as dr. allen testified to this. there is evidence in the record. this is why we have jury trials. and what happened was this test was solely for attempting to diagnose inherited enzyme defects. this is rare. nobody used it. there was not a market for it. as a result of the discovery, the medical community came around and concluded that everything they were doing was wrong and the new test combining the knowledge that it was possible to assay for homocysteine   and by the way, the assaying means only measuring   total homocysteine with the discovery of the correlation could be put together, as diehr allows, to come up with a better diagnostic test. and at the time, obviously, and this is, again, in the trial testimony, no market for this. nobody wanted to do it. everybody was just delighted with the existing tests. and so dr. allen and dr. stabler had to set up their own lab to do it. it was after the medical community came around that all of the lab companies became interested in doing this commercially. and i go into this level of detail because i think it is in part needed to answer the point made by the solicitor general. in a world in which there was no commercial use for the existing prior art because it was used rarely, and a market develops solely as a result of people using the test to practice the invention, i think it's analytically incorrect to say that we're trying to monopolize the existing prior art. what has happened is commercial laboratory companies like labcorp are selling the test to practice our invention. it was open to them to say  
throughout this litigation? i can't   i can't be sure that we've maintained a consistent position, but ultimately this is a question of sovereign immunity. so the importance is that we get the issue right here.
they would win the judgment. would they be the real party in that controversy?
let me suggest that both the oregon supreme court and the instructions that were actually given to the jury helped answer this by looking at the statutory criteria. oregon has taken extraordinary steps since this court's decision in oberg to enact a statute that guides the courts on the, guides the juries and the courts in the assessment of punitive damages. you know, first there is a threshold. before you can even plead punitive damages you must meet that threshold and you must demonstrate to the court by admissible evidence that there was a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm, that they've acted with a conscious indifference to the health and safety and welfare of others. now, this is part of what infuses it with public purpose. then  
you're calling empty ditches   not unless you call empty ditches land, which i do.
why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?
the state  
so if we decided on the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did decide this would available to you to argue on remand?
or a motorcycle?
  military schools on military  
well, according   well, apparently the district court viewed it as a post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated, divested  
and  
no, justice stevens, there is not.
my question is, i have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened. they can't even find an instance. so it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say it never happened. and then there may be one exception or two or something like that. and i can't, that   i'm now totally puzzled. because if it's so clear as you say, and i follow your logic, and i followed collier, why? after all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. explain it.
yes, correct. i think, i think that, i think it was agreed by the parties or understood by the chinese court. my memory on this with regard to the record, maybe background facts that are not in the record but i, on summing it up, are a little be fuzzy. but i think to answer your question, mr. chief justice, there, in abstention, an   an arbitration clause i think provides a closer question than this case does for an issue of whether it's law declaring authority, i think as your question put it. it's arguable that an arbitration clause is little more than a, in essence, a forum selection clause of the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non conveniens ruling might provide.
well   well, surely the prosecution  
yes, absolutely. and   and my understanding is that   is for that reason that opm does not review the contracts and approve the contract language of blue cross blue shield.
right.
so i think i've got your point. tell me if i   i mean, i've now looked at   this is very confusing to me. i'm sure it's my fault. but i take it, if you look at page 22, that's the new policy.
yes. but that's   in respect to the chief justice's question, the   unitherm could have thought, "well, the federal circuit is not going to deal with sufficiency; therefore, i don't have to beef up"  
can you tell us on   on the liberty interest where we started with the  
trial   i wasn't trial counsel, your honor. trial counsel did, in the fourth circuit supplemental appendix, at pages 35 to 38, make inquiries.
i don't know that there was necessarily an intent to bifurcate, but i think we had the same  
yes.
and isn't that how the jury was instructed in this case?
there's a   there's a couple of reasons, your honors. first of all, as much as you may know about the transferring individual, you may not know the information about their prospective cellmate at the transfer institution because they may be somebody who's a newly received cellmate, somebody who is going through a reception center process themselves.
and if   if you think that putting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers walking, too  
well, it's  
there are   there are some contexts in administrative procedure in which the word "complaint" is used.
but isn't it true that under the guideline no weight is given to military service?
the briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion. now, do you think there's something wrong with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case?
where does that come from as a matter of law? that is, suppose   now you can say i   if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if i start with an assumption that congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. suppose i start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many. after all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. and indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. so if i start with the assumption that's what congress wanted, not what i wanted, congress wanted it, now is there something in the constitution that forbids it? that's where i start   i am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the constitution that forbids it. and is there something in the constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?
in my  
is there anything to suggest that the large-scale low-price retailers who were supposedly dependent on dr. miles are   support its retention? have they filed amicus briefs here or otherwise suggested that this is essential to their continuing operation?
could  
well, under (b)(1), a claim must be exhausted to support relief from a federal court. that is right, your honor. and these claims   if under the petitioner b scenario, the court had ruled promptly or the claims were less complex, allowing them to be disposed of earlier, mr. rhines could have had or   and should have all of his claims before the district court to be resolved. the court needs to be watchful here not to penalize mr. rhines and people who are in similar situations because they have complex claims.
so you say that the authority of   i don't   i don't even think the corps has ever suggested this. the authority of the corps extends not only to all that you've   we've been talking about and that you've asserted, but also to lands that, if altered, could have some hydrological connection.
i think if you're talking about an affirmative defense or something beyond the threshold question of whether there has been discrimination, or as in a social security act case question of whether an eligible person has been denied the benefits  
  which says, with respect to educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's no limitation at all. so, we can have both statutes without rendering either one of them nugatory. and isn't that the preferred way to read statutes?
  the textual answer.
  the attorneys here and   and a   and an agent negotiating a book contract for an author or a financial analyst.
that  
if we think that powerex, that there's a strong interest in having powerex remain in federal court if it's entitled to that under the foreign sovereign immunities act, that would be suffer to get around 1447(d)?
and, your honor, we believe that in prison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond the free exercise clause, it raises special problems and special concerns that need to be dealt with  
there could have been, your honor, but again, those reasons were never articulated to my client and any reasons the police officers may have had are not in the record.
except for the fact the district court really didn't find a violation in section 2. they didn't quite, as i'm suggesting, say, well, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it and have a defense by what we do in   in district 25. and i don't think de grandy is an answer to that, and i'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my question.
well, the court has to go back to the history of the statute, how it's evolved. clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only if it was removed without jurisdiction. and so the question is when congress changed the language to lacks subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal jurisdiction? which it  
so you're asking for a special rule for california's application of batson.
  your eighth amendment rights? you know, if your parole's revoked, you're going to go back into a very cruel and unusual prison, not the one you left.
as i recall the sixth amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you. and you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not the charge of aiding and abetting.
i don't know if it's   i mean, you know   (laughter.)
our argument is based on the   the structure and text of the statute and   and the fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied to the presumption of correctness. i'd like to emphasize that the ninth circuit in this case did apply both (d)(2) and (e)(1), as this court did in miller-el, and found that collins has satisfied both standards. so i just want to emphasize for the court, even if it does not agree with us on our construction of (e)(1), that relief is still appropriate in this case.
well, actually, i'm not aware of any private mine inspectors, but if we want to take that thought  
but it's wrong in that, isn't it?
your honor, in the florida prepaid case, there was an alternative state remedy. in that case the plaintiff could sue the state of florida   i'm sorry   yes, could sue the state of florida in that particular case. in this case, they can't do that. there is a   an estate representative, who has one option, and that option, to preserve the collective benefit of the estate, is to sue the estate   or to sue the state in the bankruptcy court.
may i ask you a question on that point? and i should know the answer. it must be in the briefs but i don't remember. i assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?
perhaps you should go on to the merits.
probably perry v. sindermann in the sense that there was clear that the contract was over but the court indicated that  
should reverse the judge then, within a   a within guidelines sentence?
  the   the grable case said, though, that the federal question had to be a necessary element of the state law cause of action. that's not always the case in these cases, is it?
but is there   i guess   i don't want to tie you up too long but i mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the ten commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the ten commandments and the religious text?
well, what about 1997(e) and (g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits. doesn't this clearly take this out of the normal pleading procedures?
that is right, justice stevens. and if this court had held that the eleventh amendment were the source or even the sole source of sovereign immunity, that would be a compelling argument. the main holding of the ex parte new york no. 1 case is, indeed, that that limitation does not apply because, as understood by hans, which had been ruled on some 31 years earlier, the sovereign immunity really comes from the structure of the constitution. and the state of this   this court's doctrine is that the eleventh amendment's sole purpose was to overrule the holding in chisholm, and that but for the fact that chisholm came down, the eleventh amendment never   if the eleventh   if the eleventh amendment had never been enacted, every sovereign immunity case would come out the same way. that is the current understanding by the court about how the doctrine works.
well, and it   you   you  
so   so in your view, there has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex financial records, business documents. there's a warrant. the search is otherwise proper. they forget to knock. they say, oh, you know, we are police officers. there's a discussion for a while. but   anything seized after that is   must be suppressed.
but i was   can   can i   i still don't quite understand the answer to the bond premium question.
nothing under the plan requires that, does it?
mr. baggot.
  this question, with that very point in mind? does it necessarily follow, if there are occasional applications of this statute that might be invalid, that the whole solomon amendment needs to be struck down?
all right.
  not fielding.
i do believe that the statute could be invalidated on that ground alone, but i don't think the court needs to do that, because i think it's clearly not congruent with constitutional requirements. and let   and i believe there are  
  that something may be so.
the sec which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise.
  dignitary about that.
regardless of the substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't that a frivolous claim?
wouldn't that lead to that result? if congress was concerned that people were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one way to string it out under your reading, but not under the state's reading, would be to file a petition for cert.
there is a distinction there.
it wouldn't just be an argument. you'd have to amend your complaint because it wasn't set out in the complaint.
yes, your honor. it might be the same here.
well, there  
does that not count too?
well, why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case? i really would consider it something of a pyrrhic victory if you win on the ground that you're arguing. so that in all future cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the ten commandments to see whether there was ever any intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent upon god. is that what you want us to do case by case?
well, your honor, no, there is no reason, but it would   it requires more than testimony by the officers. if the officers at   each testified that they conducted the search, they're   also requires a finding of fact by the trial court that the searches were, in fact, for a valid law enforcement purpose.
oh, well.
well, we  
but they're   but the solomon amendment, in order to accomplish that, is addressed to a particular expressive problem which occurs for the military   and for the law schools, for that matter   in law-school recruiting. so, it seems to me that   for   i mean, my only point is that the solomon amendment seems to have one objective. whereas, the "don't burn your draft-card rule," in o'brien, had two   or had a   let's say, had a primarily nonspeech objective with an incidental-speech burden. here, the sole objective, in the real world, seems to be an expressive objective.
well, he did write to the secretary of the interior.
i know, but take all that out of it   take all that out of it, and what is your answer to justice stevens and justice souter? that is, look, like this, you have an organization, the federal trade commission, say, or that the fda says, on the one hand, (a) broccoli industry, "fruits and vegetables are good for you; crib death device, "buy anti-crib-death devices; "buy car seats for your children"; or, "don't smoke"; or  
  right   i think, as this court has come to explain rust, as being a species of government speech   but, as i say, there is no need   there is no need for the court to get to that situation. and the fact that the government is the one in control of the speech here critically distinguished   distinguishes this case from cases like keller and abood.
oh, no, you just go back and look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody else was getting a bigger discount   if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time.
i'm sorry.
because a "threat," itself, which is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of scienter or knowledge. you can use intimidation inadvertently. you could be a very heavy, dangerous-looking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room, and a witness might come along and see you and realize, to himself, "uh-oh, i'm in trouble if i testify." if you haven't done that knowingly  
maybe. but i think that what she   but what she's saying here, though, is directly responsive. and that is also a factor which this court has noted in its decisions.
well, what i'm  
well, let   you keep talking about what happened in the past, and i'm   i find some difficulty with that because we're being asked to review a new policy. and i would like you to look at the new policy, show us where to find it in the record, and tell us specifically what's wrong with it.
  very simple "yes" or "no" question.
i think a content neutral, content neutrality is critical here, and if the school wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has an outside of the official forum  
why did you say   in truth, maybe i missed it. in your response to justice kennedy, i think you said, when he asked, that this court has never said that the explicit use of race by a k through 12 school board was constitutional, and i thought the court had explicitly said that in swann.
but mr. kellogg, that's not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact that there was an agreement to prevent competitive entry into respective markets. there are dozens of antitrust complaints that are no more specific than that.
well, if he terminates the chase using deadly force, that that creates a whole host of other problems.
no, i'm saying just to look at the   just limit to the market to   the only market participants would be michigan wine  
that's  
they'd have to pay the premium.
it   it goes to whether we want to use, you know, section 3 as   as our definition.
so sandoval doesn't mean a heck of a lot. all the fcc has to say is, we think violation of this regulation is unjust.
otherwise, i mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if   if that had not been the case.
and there was a discrimination   namely, the offer was discriminatory. and there was a harm to competition, in the   in the robinson-patman sense   his rival got the sale.
thank you, counsel. mr. gornstein.
you don't. in fact   in fact, there's no provision for amending the charter. what you have to do is amend your articles of association if you move the main office   if you move the main office outside the city or town in which the main office previously was found.
i think the problem here   let me say two things in response to that, justice stevens.
yes. the entry would be lawful. the manner of entry would be unlawful. and the consequence of that entry would turn on what force was used. as, in this case, they opened the door and walked in. there was no   there was no injury to person, there was no injury to property.
  could the government, nevertheless, insist on the industry financing advertising advocating the government's position?
no, we believe that complying with an international convention designed to prohibit trafficking in drugs is, itself, a compelling interest. and the   under this court's decisions in  
would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them? you distinguish text from the crucifix and so on. why?
no, you have to have the monopoly power as well.
and are there a half a dozen jury trials in each   for each of those various aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the jury?
well, i beg to differ, chief justice roberts, because the differences were predicated on assumptions about the type of individuals who would engage in that. and the court in her experience could look at it and say you aren't the typical crack defendant, you are more like the people who come before me who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't possess the violence, the weaponry and the other things that justified congress's decision to create disparate sentences for these two kinds of cocaine.
have there  
so there would be two causes of action?
mr. kasner, you have 3 minutes remaining.
is that consistent with quill?
only   it's   that is true only for successive petitioners. for people who aren't satisfied with the round of direct appeal and a round of first   of post-conviction review in state court. and so the question is whether the federal statute should be interpreted in a way that essentially writes off the state's time requirements for the successive petitioner so that we can make sure that the successive petitioner can exhaust whatever new claims he wants to come up with in state court before he comes to federal circuit.
are you   are you relying to any extent on something that i think you brought up? he also could not have been tried because the prosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was on extended leave, which was occurring in this period?
okay. but if   if the test is going to be as unhelpful as it would be in my extreme hypothetical, why have the test at all? because in the more difficult case where it's not $5 an apartment, but a case like this in which the justification is ultimately a justification in gasoline prices and so on, the   the inquiry is going to be much more complex. penn central is a way of approaching that complexity. why do we bother with this threshold test which produces a bizarre result in one case and is going to be very difficult to apply in another case, in which event i don't see the reason for having it as distinct from the penn central difficulty test. what's   what's its value?
may i ask you there basically to comment on the point that justice scalia made in the course of the last argument? the context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the ten commandments alone and then version 2, the ten commandments had certain   were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts. and finally, as i guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context. isn't the problem that you have to face, as i've said before, what justice scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on. everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place. what is your response to that?
digital i remember.
no, your honor. it's not mentioned in this definition.
did you file a brief in opposition in halbert?
and who paid for that? did these people pay for that?
it just seemed to me that it might be more burdensome on the voter in that situation.
sorry i see my light is on.
even though those cases say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.
that's right.
no. no. now that there is a violation, you have to cure it. you have to cure it. and the only way to cure it is for someone to speak to him.
well, no, your honor, but california has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a fact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper term. it's simply saying that when the court selects between the three, the decision must be reasonable.
the pricing didn't have anything to do with   if it please the court, the pricing didn't anything to do with the joint venture. on page 12  
well, bear in mind   bear in mind the nature of many education  
thank you very much, mr. mccartan. mr. kneedler, you have 3 minutes left.
but it also had the exception for student loans. it's   it was  
even though it did not amount to   did not have any economic effect on the employee.
including contract monitoring.
that's the question i had. i got somewhat thrown by the chief justice's question, because i thought first, when i read the reg, 34.4.ab, that those things that are preempted are those things that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words limit, the federal powers of a national bank.
  without there being a search and hence no fourth amendment concern?
  and i think you're probably right  
do you think that's a reasonable interpretation of properly filed and   and what i proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation of properly filed?
is that your position?
okay, but   no. i'm sorry.
the   it   it could occur in two different ways.
you have   by criminal laws  
well, in fact, there's nothing in the regulations   and i think the solicitor general would concede   that actually requires this informal process. it happens to be typically done. and the sg uses the word "typically" in the brief. but there's nothing that requires it. and if you don't respond, there are no consequences to failure to respond.
no. what the 180 days is for is determining the time period during which the allegedly illegal act must occur. that period can be tolled using a tolling rule. it can tolled for three years possibly. the back pay rule says, even if you tolled the statute of limitations for more than the two-year back pay period, you can only get back pay for two years. what is going on, of course, in this case, is they are trying to use allegedly discriminatory acts that occurred 10, 15, 20 years ago, both to make neutral acts actionable, and to get compensatory and punitive damages.
what the fourth circuit has done is destroy  
that   that happens often with time limits. i mean, it depends on when the court finishes its job and so forth. what do you do about   about our opinion in   in duncan v. walker where we refused to toll the limitation period during the pendency of a   of the federal proceeding and   and said, in   in justification of that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies and not during the pendency of applications for federal review, 2244 provides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in the lower federal courts? you are now urging us to eliminate that incentive entirely.
ms. lee  
why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing? they could just refile.
  such as incorrect sentencing?
could i have a review of the bidding? what   [laughter.]
  what your theory is. and so you are in agreement with your colleague that this could be done, if new york chose. you can only drink new york-grown wines in   sell and consume   in the state of new york.
  you don't   you don't value it as much as ferc does, though, do you?
with   with character, we know   we know he's a murderer.
and you're going to draw the   well, i don't want you to repeat yourself necessarily.
yes.
in this case?
if i can find it, your honor, sure. i'm sorry, your honor.
different purposes.
you're right about that.
yes.
and you agree that the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax question is an open issue before this court. we have not had a holding on that.
  from disclaiming  
mr. nolas, there were some 17 records that the prosecution sought and used. was it   18 the records that were in the very courthouse.
yes, your honor. but they're not a party to this case.
that   that would make a lot of sense if you really felt that what totten is is   is a dismissal on the merits, just saying there's   there's no contractual claim. i   i mean, if you didn't believe that, if   if you believed that what totten says is we have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we could resolve all of the questions. but it seems to me if you believe that totten is based mainly   you know, it's a contract case and said the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be reaching the contract issue. we should simply say that if   if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due process claim here and   and no claim based on the regulations. how do we get the authority to decide the   the contract question?
right. anymore than anybody's buying two cars from two different purchasers in the   in the classic inventory situation.
it  
so you say it is a vessel. i thought your answer before was that it was not a vessel because it's not practically capable of being used.
thank you, general. mr. bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.
justice ginsburg, as you correctly pointed out, ideal's second amended complaint, which is not before this court in this proceeding, alleged an income tax scheme. and   and judge berman in the southern district of new york permitted that amendment. i am not aware of another case involving a competitor bringing a claim on these set of facts. however, as we pointed out in our brief on the merits, there is a discrete set of rico cases involving competitors as plaintiffs who either allege misrepresentations to third parties, whether customers or government agencies, bribes, or violence and threats of violence. i submit to you that this court's decision in national organization for women in 1994 presents a variation on the theme. you will recall that in that case the anti-abortion protestors, the defendants, engaged in violence or threats of violence directed at customers, and the injury was to the health care clinics, the plaintiffs. and   and i wish to say that   that petitioners  
well, what about the exceptional case? i mean, how do we avoid the exceptional case?
did i   could you give   give the same answer  
or say the error is not complying with the act.
in   in this lawsuit, if we win on the merits, they will then get far more appointments on the rotation system and then they will get paid for those appointments.
well, i think  
well, we may argue about what the fraction may be and we may argue about what substantiality means. but one thing i don't think we can argue about is that casey was applying the salerno standard.
and would you distinguish between instances of duress where it may a negative mens rea and instances where it may not?
in a jury case, your honor?
please.
if you accept the government's definition of economic, then every   then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that  
and that is transmission  
thank you, ms. halligan.
well, your honor, certainly where the motion has been made and has, in fact, been briefed, and has been considered by the court, and where you have a situation in which  
all right. no, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition. and if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial. doesn't it? i mean, because all   i mean   and then we've swept   then we've done   we've really moved balisok from what it was trying to do.
thank you, counsel. mr. srinivasan.
is that a judgment clear enough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate as to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the message? let's assume it was an ambiguous message. would we have to accept her interpretation on summary judgment?
well, the jury did  
that is correct, justice ginsburg.
well, if what he's saying is, the way we have always done it is engage in gender discrimination, then doing it in the present time period would state a present claim.
so in terms of  
where the carrier   where they would file a complaint saying you owe us x dollars, and the agency could order them to pay x dollars.
removal. removal was-
no, it didn't "stop it"  
where do you draw the line? is there some   i   i take it that you say certainly if the plea colloquy or the   or the judge's guilt determination refers to the police report, then the police report comes in. suppose there's no reference to the police report.
when it's halfway out, i guess you can call it either a child or a fetus. it's sort of half and half isn't it? official
i think they do, and they drew a line that was upheld on its face because the vast majority of ads  
well, and they   and they found other   other videotapes besides the one that had just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of the search?
i mean, what the court  
because it intrudes on other interests that our state  
i must confess i'm a little puzzled about the discussion of the trial strategy because is it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one has been met, the prosecutor always answers the question?
that's what i thought. yes, i thought it was a pretty harsh rule.
no.
yeah, that's their theory.
well, i would say what it   what it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a necessary fact. because this court, in altvater, specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an injunction there, there would be   there would be the danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit; and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions. an injunction suit can put a company out of business, especially like a company like my client here. and  
i thought the whole purpose of aedpa was   was to prevent delay. i mean, that's   that's what's   it seems to me counter-intuitive about the position you're   you're urging upon us. here is a statute that was meant to stop these things from dragging on endlessly.
if   let me put it another way.
  about how this operates and who reviews what? one of the claims that was made   this prisoner filed twice. and, the second time, as i recall, he said, "every day that i'm here, the clock starts running again, because this is a continuing violation. i'm restricted today, and i'll be restricted tomorrow." and there was no   is that something that would be reviewable in court?
no. with respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent federal functions, that's not available.
you explain. i   i thought when i first read this, that this was quite broad, but i may not have read it perfectly.
well, what   what   take this variable. the   the warrant can be executed when the item is taken into the house, if i remember what it said. suppose the defendant is sitting on a porch, sees the postal carrier, gets up, takes the package, and proceeds to walk down the street, and never enters the house. could the warrant be executed?
it seems to me rather difficult to   to draw that line. if   if consent is necessary, why shouldn't it be express? i'm not saying consent is necessary, but normally if you're going to have something this important and consent is necessary, it seems to me it ought to be clear on the record. you certainly wouldn't accept this for a guilty plea, what you have here.
thank you, counsel. mr. russell, you have 3 minutes remaining.
but why would you recognize a due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a first amendment violation?
do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of congress that there's no acceptable medical use? say they had a   say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. would we have to ignore that? would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?
well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use? what's fair?
not the intoxication. the intoxication has to be  
well, i think that if the amount  
i'm not sure i understand the question, justice breyer.
  what do you respond to the argument that this has been the law in a number of circuits and the sky has not fallen?
so then it's a really easy case, because really there is some risk in every case. there's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.
i'm putting it dramatically because i want to get your  
  which leads me to the question, in response to your answer to justice ginsburg a moment ago, in your view is the compelling interest on the part of the government recruitment or the refusal to accept gays?
i believe that this court's decision in dura pharmaceutical  
  you know, the federal government and i think some states gave   gave railroads the power to condemn land. did that make railroads sovereigns entitled to sovereign immunity? i don't think so.
i didn't like your characterization and the government's of the state of the record. i asked my law clerk basically to go look up every statement that was made in four forums. the first was the first stenberg case. second was congress. third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is the other case here. now, my own impression of that is if you're talking about the medical need for such a case, that is for intact d&e, that there is a risk attached if you don't use it in some instances. the fewest number of statements for that proposition was in the first stenberg.
mr. mccartan, i   i still don't entirely understand what you would want the government to prove under your system in order to   in order to   to win this case. they would have to prove what? that   that  
  you have to look at a job description? and does it have to be listed specifically in a job description? could there ever be things that it's understood that are things that any employee ought to be concerned about, such as very serious wrongdoing within the office?
where in the complaint does it allege a tortious interference claim?
yes.
the   the clause that introduces that is under current law, and that's absolutely true in the eleventh circuit. under current law, as it existed in the eleventh circuit when we wrote that, there was no question that a corporation can be included within an association-in-fact enterprise. therefore, all we were doing was conceding what the state of the law was in the eleventh circuit and not questioning that, as   as, candidly, we had no ability to do that. it would have been an utterly futile gesture to have raised this issue at any point prior to. we could have raised it in the petition for certiorari, to be sure. we   we think it is fairly subsumed within the question presented, and we also think it would be an   an utterly artificial exercise to try to analyze what is an association-in-fact enterprise without first deciding whether or not a corporation could be included in the first instance because, as justice scalia says, if they can't, then it seems to me this is a substantially easier question, and also it is an extraordinarily important one. it is true that the courts of appeals have lined up consistently on the other side of this issue, but it is equally true that none of them has analyzed this issue with anything near the kind of care that would at least give me comfort that they've finally and fully resolved the issue. and we're not going to get a more thorough vetting of it at this point because the circuits are   are at this   at this stage essentially lined up. so the right time and opportunity for the court is here.
but   but may i interrupt you? what   what about   i want to just follow up on something that justice breyer alluded to and that is the significance of the dna evidence. and i have tended to   to think that a reasonable juror would look at it this way, but if i'm wrong, i   i want you to comment on it. one of the   i   i assume, to begin with, that any reasonable juror would have found this evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely significant because not only did the state argue rape as a   as a motive, possible motive, but there was a specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape. i don't know of any evidence that would suggest an   an independent kidnapping crime without the rape element under, you know, the circumstances of   of this crime. so i'm   i   i assume that the reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a rape was being committed. if that juror had heard the dna evidence, that juror would have said the only positive evidence that a rape was committed here would be evidence that pointed to the husband, not in fact to   to the defendant house. and if   if a juror had heard that evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would have concluded that that aggravating circumstance was found, and i suppose that would play a   a significant role in   in the ultimate conclusion. now, you have argued that the fact that the dna evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids, not house's, doesn't conclusively prove that house didn't rape her, and of course, you're right. but my understanding is that there is no evidence from which one would reasonably infer that house did this. now, what is   what is your comment on that  
but if that's the answer, excellent. so now we have   (laughter.)
  light of that determination, jurors, naturally, would understand that they could take into account anything that extenuated the gravity of the crime.
she   she's just typed that out on the computer or something like that?
exactly, and not just the person in oregon. but everybody in between oregon and florida all have the same amount of standing. no, what we're saying is plenty of people would be able to challenge that. but not  
justice kennedy  
haven't we said in at least one of our cases that the government can't favor religion over irreligion?
why is it so hard if you take justice stevens' premise that there's an agreement and we take that as a given, as a given premise?
unless they have chosen to waive it, which  
i think there are three answers to that. surely the patent laws cannot be determined according to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to replicate something. there has to be a line that makes some sense. number two, it may be fast and efficient but there are certainly costs involved in taking the machines to do it. number three, where would that take us? a design   every product contains its own manifestation of its design. that would take us everywhere, because any product can be copied abroad. however   and maybe there are going to be fast ways to produce other things. these are replicas, reproductions, copies. these are not such components that are supplied from the united states. if i may reserve the balance of my time? thank you.
we don't agree. we believe that likelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense.
no, it's imposing tax on property in the state at a higher rate if it's not the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't live in the state.
well, there   there are   first of all, there are no guarantees. the   the preclusion doctrines are   are riddled with exceptions.
why would he think that? why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is subject to being deported under such rules as the country has for deporting people who are here illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time? that would be my expectation if i came in illegally, in violation of the law. i'm saying, "i'm here at the sufferance of the country. i shouldn't be here. and whatever rules they have for kicking me out are the rules that i'll have to abide by."
i believe they can. this   this jury did a very good job. first of all, if they  
right. exactly the same situation. they can   they can bring the case directly for the client they're representing just as readily as they can bring this one. and if that is true, why is there an impediment to raising the issue unless we recognize third party standing?
well, not   but   but it's a much more complicated issue preclusion problem because the question is, is there jurisdiction? this is a judgment that's been entered without jurisdiction. the court doesn't have proper jurisdiction here  
respectfully, your honor, you have to follow it through. the subcommittee said we intend to overrule zahn. the words in this statute were written by the people who said we intend to overrule zahn.
what was your response?
how do you deal with the court's   the footnote in the blue chip stamp   that the court says   in the federal court   "these 10(b) actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because deserving claims by nontraders would lie under state law, including the very suit that was involved in blue chip stamps and in the second circuit case that paved the way for blue chip?
your honor, i don't believe the record is such that we've alleged that ms. gonzales knew that they weren't going to do anything. in fact, it's just the opposite, that she relied upon  
  assert that there's a discrepancy?
at   at some point a person has to be told what congress was intending. this language goes back to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting it to state   excluding federal and state convictions matched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a), which was title vii. they were   they were complementing each other. and   and if you look at even as far back as the batchelder decision in the '70's from this court, the court talked about these two being redundant, overlapping, the only difference being that one uses the term felony, one uses the term crime punishable by more than a year.
  under state law in this   in this situation.
  or those would be lost forever  
mr.  
which is that?
well, the respondent has essentially conceded that under o'neal that they bear the risk of non-persuasion.
thank you, counsel.
can i ask you a question that goes to your response to justice souter's last question? as i understand the scheme, maybe my understanding is wrong, once they have found the existence of those aggravating factors that justify the death penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase for them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty would be imposed, it's not up to them to   they can't eliminate one of those aggravating factors that has been found. they have to take into account all of the aggravating factors that have been found. isn't that right?
we don't even have any cases involving a property interest to enforcement against somebody else. all we have are cases to the contrary. linda r.s., for example, this court held that there is no right to arrest or enforcement against somebody else. and so i think at least in the context of these very non-zany property interest claims, that we need to have a pretty clear statement, not even from the colorado courts, but from the legislature itself that the legislature intended, as a matter of state policy, to have a property interest created and all of the consequences that would flow from that.
well, maybe i don't understand the question correctly. but in beck, you know, the jury wasn't told that the judge would have a separate option of denying the death penalty. in this case, judge in state's   court instruction c-5, the court says you are not to consider the sentence, that you only consider the issue of guilt or innocence of the charge. and so that's why i say this is not a beck issue because it doesn't impact the   the jury's determination in the guilt phase.
and they were making it unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in 18-371 or whatever it was.
so far as this case is concerned, yes. and   and so if judge giles got it wrong, isn't there a pretty good argument for equitable tolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?
are there regulations, fcc regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair and unreasonable?
yes. that was a decision of the michigan supreme court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits. the michigan supreme court denies the applications for saying   by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.
the problem in this case, in terms of asserting arising-under jurisdiction, is   and   and in terms of boyle also, is that the   the petitioner has failed to point out any difference in how it would occur. there is absolutely no difference pointed out by the petitioner as to how the law would differ  
thank you, mr. dreeben. ms. mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.
but i want you to go back before we get to a judgment. can such a suit be brought?
  absent of good-cop/bad-cop finding, and i   and i repeat that they've credited johns' testimony here   this seems to me a very odd sort of interrogation, to say, "no, no, you   we can't talk to him now." that's an interrogation? that's a stretch.
where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?
well, i think that this case was a good example. there were two defendants and the court of appeals  
well, can you look at the interest of the government as one of not allowing u.s. territory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme? i mean, why does it have to be viewed as one of trying to enforce some other nation's tax laws?
you'll have to ask them, justice scalia. they filed a motion that it was obvious.
actually most prisoners are not represented, i don't think, at this stage. they   they haven't a clue about the word exhaustion, and they haven't a clue about the statute of limitations. so they file a   a paper in   in the state court, and they say this roughly is what my problem is. is that what happens, or are they all quite educated?
right.
right.
it's a   it's a little odd for the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we look to the rules, but we interpret it differently. i certainly see the common sense of your position, but i'm just having a problem with 15(c)(2).
  in favor of the opponent of the motion.
the case is submitted.
  what do you respond to the argument that this has been the law in a number of circuits and the sky has not fallen?
no. i don't know how the california court could have read the opinion   which, of course, i wrote for the court, so maybe i am reading things into it that weren't there   but i don't know how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come to this conclusion. i thought that it said, you know, on   that there are three issues   what's the word "pending"? does the word "pending" apply to the time period between when the lower court decides a case and you appeal? that's typically 20 days or 30 days.
well, if you have not, then my experience would be you're arguing for a rule that no appeals court follows, that   that all think they have power over the mandate, and that the question becomes one of whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the mandate.
at least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his   his analysis.
you didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (laughter.)
why then do they not, on your theory, have to give tv and magazines back?
  that the dealer didn't purchase goods for resale in competition with other volvo dealers? that's exactly what they do every day, isn't it?
  "purchase or sale."
well, why   why are you resisting that the   that the police report gave an identified building? i mean, you're   you're saying that one mustn't look behind, in the case of a guilty plea, to find the police report or even the police application for complaint. but there isn't any question, is there, that the police reports in fact gave addresses of particular buildings?
justice scalia, i disagree for the following reasons, and that is: what the federal circuit is saying is that any amount of evidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a particular question. we have a question that we want answered. they have a question they want answered. their question, the petitioner at least, i'm not sure about the solicitor general, the petitioner's standard is, was somebody capable of doing this? we have a different question. would it have been apparent to, and that's what we think the text requires, would it have been apparent to one skilled in the art? and so the federal circuit is saying whatever evidence you want to bring to bear  
do you think that the   the steps in this case have to be determined by what we do in title vii, that whatever we do here should be   should be, must be the same as what we do in title vii?
well, i don't know what that's got to   you know, you may or may not have an argument there, but i don't know what it's got to do with the meaning of the establishment clause.
most of them don't.
you're not saying he would win on pickering balancing, but he would at least get to the point of going through the balancing exercise.
it does apply   it is a limitation. it is not a limitation that would protect the expectation of privacy of a nonparole  
  make the concession, as i understand it, because it's a federal felony, not because it's a state felony  
i think that   the case that the u.s. cites in its footnote is an example where reexamination processes are underway when the case is first filed or when it's pending in the district court, and the district judge certainly has the discretion to say, i don't want to get into a   a fight here about separation of powers and hayburns case. let's let the reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial. in this case, ebay waited not only until it was sued and not only until it was found to have willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of the appeals process. it then comes running in and a rule that would allow a district judge now to give notice of that in denying an injunction would basically be a   an open invitation for everybody to go ahead and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi-year process, and if you don't, just put it into reexam. this   although the reexamination is required to be   is required to proceed with, quote, special dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the '265 patent has been almost 3 years in the patent office and we still don't have a final action. so we think, in the circumstances of this case, where the district judge had no reason to consider reexam because ebay hadn't invoked reexam at the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in light of the fact that it's now proceeding. but that's not an issue for this court. it wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the requisite equitable factors. and what   if i can just get back to the facts of this particular case and then talk about the law. the finding of ebay's willfulness in this case disables ebay from invoking the relative balance of harms. we certainly agree  
i guess this   this problem is simply a consequence of the well-pleaded complaint rule.
well, that's true. but if we're talking about future violations of the law, it is very often the case that persons who are deported to mexico do come back, and do have their supervised release   official
the contract, reasonableness, all of those issues. the circuit split, which we presented to the court, and which i understand certiorari was   well, i'm guessing   certiorari was granted on, it deals with the fobian rule. as this common law rule, this sort of construct, that if you're litigating federal law issues, well, as a matter of general federal common law, you can't get the attorneys' fees unless it's authorized by federal law. and our brief was entirely devoted to that. you can't justify that rule in our view under preemption principles; there's no conflict; there is no congress preempting the field in any way; you can't justify this under atherton as a, as a   something that's necessary because of a conflict with federal policy. and also the fobian rule is inappropriately categorical, in violation of what we submit are these court's principles in the nolan case, in the cf and i case. in those cases, the court said: it's not for the courts to create these claims processing rules in bankruptcy. but that exactly is what the ninth circuit did here. if there are no further questions i'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
  happened. nothing happened. there was  
that wasn't the interpretation. your honor, let's back up, if i may. someone has to interpret the message and the front line message interpreter is the school official. the school official  
  mr. hungar, do you agree with mr. englert that even if you had   you could   you had a case based on two dealers, one consistently gets higher concessions, one consistently gets lower concessions, and they're in roughly the same market   that even that would not be covered by robinson-patman?
if it's a function of the person's job   assigned job duties. so, the   you look at the speech at issue. and here is   it's a disposition memorandum that was purely pursuant to what the   what his duties required. he's   it's normally a function that the employer would take into consideration for things like promotions  
  and they got no reduction  
it is an island-wide tax, your honor. land is taxed at one-quarter of 1 percent and improvements are taxed at 1 percent.
but these  
well, again, we think congress knows how to write that statute, and it does it differently. it has a different provision. for example, in the family medical leave act, not only included the coercion and intimidation language, it also said in any manner discriminate. we also think, again, going to our interpretation of discriminate against, it makes sense to read that for a   as a shorthand for the   the unlawful practices spelled out and detailed in section 703.
yes, okay. and anything else?
that   that's right, justice 2 ginsburg. we agree with that. the   the purpose of aedpa's limitation 4 provision, to use this court's language in duncan v. 5 walker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road 6 to finality by restricting the time that a prospective 7 habeas petitioner has in which to seek habeas review. we 8 think petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with 9 that purpose not only because it permits a delay in 10 challenging the state conviction and, as a consequence, in 11 challenging the federal sentence, but because it 12 encourages it. as i mentioned before, the longer a 13 prisoner waits to challenge his state conviction, other 14 things being the same, the greater the likelihood of 15 success either because the necessary records that the 16 state would need to defend the judgment are unavailable or 17 because the state prosecutor has less of an incentive to 18 defend it than he might have while the sentence was still 19 being served.
  the related   the related question that   well, assuming the vienna convention is certainly law, and treaty stands on the same footing as law, but i believe that the   texas and the government have said the aedpa statute is the later-in-time provision, and when you have two provisions with a statute treaty, the later-in-time prevails. so why did   why isn't the aedpa controlling, and not the vienna convention?
he created the scariest chase i ever saw since "the french connection." (laughter.)
i thought it could be, if you want to play games, there is an imaginary right to which blackstone has referred 48 times. yet, for some odd reason, that right has never come to the supreme court of the united states. but one day it does. it is a right of constitutional dimensions embedded in the law of stoppage in transitu. and although it's well recognized, we've never had a case. finally, we get one, and it is initially recognized here, but it is not newly recognized for every treatise on stoppage in transitu has long assumed that it was part of the law of the united states. i don't know. that's what i thought it was.
i think   i think that there   i would divide my response to that, justice breyer, into two parts really. on the questioning issue, i would just say that that   that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate fourth amendment violation. it wasn't. and we didn't argue it in the ninth circuit. what we did   we did say in our   in our brief to the ninth circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to   to summers detention. we did say that.
the offense is never completed. there's nothing   nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this section. this section sets forth the penalty   that's your argument   but it does not establish the offense. the offense is established by 371. if that's the case, this allocation of responsibility among the various divisions of the government doesn't apply to conspiracy prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.
but i   i don't   sorry. if i could just finish. i don't contest the rest of it, which is that on remand, preemption can be developed through amended pleadings, through facts that are developed  
that's correct.
perhaps, but it's certainly true that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any compelling justification for restricting entities' contributions and expenditures in support of or in opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this court's law, is fully clearly on that point. it's our submission, mr. chief justice, that what you have here is a content-based restriction on wea's ability to engage in political speech on issues of educational policy that are of vital importance to the 70,000 teachers that it represents.
well  
the district court on february 17th of 2000 had   had granted the stay.
they didn't violate that section, did they? the contracts that we're talking about.
didn't you seek to reserve the federal question in the   in the state court litigation?
i don't dispute that.
justice  
the court simply ignored the   the   the process of   of the case   the extension ability in subsection (b) was never invoked by the court. there was a timely petition for rehearing filed, which automatically stayed the mandate under subsection (d)(1).
  the claim. that'll always be the claim. they'll always say, "oh, yeah, you said you did it because of that, but you did it because you're retaliating"  
and it is really the factual determination that is the hang-up, that you don't want things that are innocent and that the sec would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of guilty by the jury. so you really haven't accomplished a whole lot if you just send it over to the sec for rulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this particular conduct violated the law.
  perhaps, 1983, if you go the unconstitutional condition argument, and certainly in 1983   or arguably a civil rights prosecution against the senior who ordered  
  not to whether it's a vessel or not. it is still a vessel even if it's beached up on land so long as it is capable of   of floating. it's just not in navigation, isn't it?
but the   the state application that preceded that   he was represented there.
well, i think you said the   you thought the police here had to wait what? 15 seconds? what was the figure you gave?
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
may i ask you this, and i think this applies to the case we have got, as well as to justice stevens' hypothetical. you said in justice stevens'   in answer to justice stevens' hypothetical, that they could achieve a result, legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within the respective faculties of these schools if they took other things in addition to race into consideration. you mentioned ability as teachers and so on. but at the end of the day, the object of doing this, which justice stevens' hypo assumed, and i think the object of doing it which your answer assumed, was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties. my question is: why do thy have to hide the ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other things, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever you could come up with when at the beginning and at the end, the objective is to achieve a racial mix? why can't they do that candidly and employ a criterion that candidly addresses that objective?
well, how do you think it should   you think the police officer should give it as part of the miranda warnings, or what's   what's your conclusion as to how it should be implemented?
well, and the reality is the district court already looked at this and said that it   it is the district court's judgment that they're going to require full infringement trials. i mean, that was the finding it made with respect to the balance of hardships. and   and neither the court of appeals nor the   nor the respondent in this case has   has challenged that particular finding. so the reality is the district court has made the determination that that's not   that process is either not available or not practical in the context of this particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's important to make sure that you look at each of these cases on their individual facts rather than across the board on a   on these   on an irrebuttable presumption basis. the   the additional point that i think it's important i at least spend a minute on, because the court asked for us to deal with continental paper bag, is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync, that   that the court need not revisit continental paper bag. the holding in that case is actually almost a sort of quintessential situation where you have two participants in the market, one of whom would like to take advantage of a patent that will improve that participant's ability to produce a product. the patent holder is not ready yet to develop that product using that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his competitor from entering into that market. i mean, that's the classic kind of situation where you have a   you know, where you   where you've got the potential infringer is looking at what's going on and making a decision and copying it and then trying to implement it. and the court said, under those circumstances, you get an injunction. but here, of course, we're dealing with a vastly different situation, as we   as we point out that   in our brief, where the   at page 9 where the district court specifically found that not any of ebay's success is attributable to anything in the patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff in this case provide any basis on which anyone could build a business model. so this is, to my mind, the antithesis of the situation in continental paper bag. but in any event, the holding there is clearly not implicated here. it's been codified by congress. there's no basis for the court to reconsider it. to the extent that there is   is dicta in there that talks about the right to exclude, justice scalia, i think, in general, the right to exclude is one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive relief in many cases, but the question here is whether or not the federal circuit should have adopted a rule that says you   you enforce it in every case irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to the fourth factor, you don't go any further than requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a   an imminent public health crisis. under those circumstances, it seems to me the court should reverse the court of appeals. and, indeed, if there were ever a case in which the court ought to uphold the district court on a   under the abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.
it is, and no one has thought this was equal. the two courts   the three courts, the california court of appeals also said in any event there's no possible prejudice. now, how they could say no possible prejudice under a state standard and still say, ah, but it would have affected the verdict under chapman, is not something i'm able to understand. so i think you have  
exactly  
  just construing instead of not following, but say by capable, congress must mean practically capable.
well, your honor, we believe that the incidental test, and what i've been talking about in terms of what the limits are, that it has to be a non-incidental expenditure protects against that. because if the argument is that some government official, for part of his day met with three ministers, and therefore we want to challenge because government shouldn't be meeting with ministers, i think it's both for the reason, both because of the fact this is not an argument that the expenditure on the hours of the day it took to have those meetings is clearly not central to anything.
and is it correct that   who   was this litigant represented by counsel during the period when he didn't get the notice of the september 9 order?
well  
well, it's a very difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, justice kennedy. and i think it actually, that question, though, has direct bearing on this case, because congress after all found that there was some risks with the d&x procedure. the most prominent one that i would point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because the d&x procedure does   it does require additional dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing future pregnancies. and that was born out, although not at a level of statistical significance, in the chasen study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17 women who had the d&x procedure and were available for follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the follow-up. so i think those risks are born out in the only study that's available. and i think the question becomes, now, if d&x were some life-saving procedure for something that there was no other known cure for, you might think, well, those are the risks you run. but when there remains available the d&e procedure, which has been well tested and works every single time as a way to terminate the pregnancy, then i think risks that, if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for some life-threatening condition with no known cure, those risks might not be significant in that context.
what would happen if you couldn't use this system?
but when you   when you say freely choosing, what you mean, i take it, is choosing with   without consideration of pressure from a third party. that's what you mean, isn't it?
  that one of those criteria has been asserted  
so, if you put a waterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition, that's a discharge into the navigable water.
mr. franklin, are   are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters?
and the court   the court's decision in rust, i think, is the best illustration of that.
yes, i agree. and that was not used in this case. i   and i   we agree that that would be an appropriate way to raise this.
impede. i believe   i believe it was done as a   as a   as a group.
i  
well, assuming that you could get through the hurdles. and i don't think punitive damages would necessarily sound there. in the kolstad case, the court indicated one factor to consider would be how quickly the   the defendant corrected the situation. i mean, if you have a   if there's a legitimate process that's   that's available and a supervisor who has authority to suspend does that for a retaliatory motive and   and that process corrects it, it may be a factor in punitives, but it's not a factor whether a   an act has been taken because the act is a discrete act. it caused her to lose compensation and   and to lose benefits. so it could affect the punitive damages. now, with respect to the   the statutory construction   well, let me address the   the forklift issue just a   a little bit further. if you take the position that the   the petitioner has here, ms. white   it's a jury finding. their witnesses testified   went from the most easy or one of the most easy positions to the most difficult position because she complained about sexual harassment. that's the finding of fact. they don't dispute the findings of fact. that's the finding of fact. so if   if he's correct, tomorrow, if his   his position is affirmed, they could tell everyone who complains about sexual harassment, that if you do that, we're going to transfer you to the most difficult position in the company.
traditionally.
in part but not in whole.
to the extent that vermont legislators can be bought off by $51? (laughter.)
that's a functional difference.
but a single judge doesn't have the authority, does he?
and rule 20 you could not?
thank you, mr. bailey. mr. stewart.
well, it's 1091(a).
  of the controlled substances act.
but isn't   it's in fact easier for you here. you can go down to the patent office and see what they've distinguished as   the sense in which their product is an innovation and why it's not just like the other products that might be available that you could use.
no, i don't think so. i think they go to whether the confession he gave was voluntary, but i don't see how they have anything to do with whether he initiated the conversation.
i take it you're talking about language, if i followed it, in 2244(d)(2).
do you have any, is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the parallel conduct?
well, congress has made very clear that loss causation is an element of the cause of action. the elements must be pled. in a fraud case, they must be pled with particularity, but even   even in a   in a common law  
but we know that that's not going to happen here, because the chinese court has adjudicated the case.
i think y is mr. gearin.
the proximity of the reference to the supreme court there really  
are there   are there instances, under your view of the statute, in   under the standard you propose, where costs would be awarded, but not fees?
well, but there had been case-law changes, hadn't there?
you know, again, if   it is not   the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the legislative materials, and we can assume that at least one of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation, the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals repose, which is a purpose of time bars.
  test.
  filing period.
your honor, i would think the answer to that question is no. it's not a question that i have examined in depth in   in this case because it's not presented, but as a general matter  
no. 34.
is that the reason these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?
right.
thank you, counsel. mr. blume?
no, it does not, your honor. sorry.
i'm   i'm talking about the colloquy. i'm talking about the colloquy.
not at all. i think that in form  
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
may i suggest  
and sometimes in reliance on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no jurisdiction here; too bad.
why isn't it dismissed on the basis that they   they don't have a cause of action because they've assigned it?
is that a draconian rule, do you think? you have to have three actions dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?
well we did actually have some record evidence in this case that at least a few people were doing that. one of the major suppliers of the respondent here, ross-simmons, was a company called longview fiber which made it   a very sophisticated publicly held company   made it a practice to sell most of its volume to ross-simmons on a market basis because it did not want the eventuality of not having ross-simmons in that competitive circle with weyerhaeuser. most small woodland owners, however, who may only be in the market once every five years because that's the nature of their rotation, of the age classes of the timber that they have got, are not in that kind of sophisticated position because they are in the market so infrequently to make that kind of a judgment. it's been  
it   it does say that, your honor.
correct. that's exactly right.
i understand your submission   and that's what i heard from the solicitor general, as well   on the difference between enforcement and the substantive right. you're assuring us that we don't need to worry about that, because there's no great difference between what you think is required under the ada and what's required under the constitution.
well, but it seems to me that that's quite a foreseeable possibility. if there is such a thing as private safety inspectors in arizona   i'm not sure, but if there are, i assume that what they do is, when they go into a particular industrial area, they look at the safety standards for that industry, including federal and state regulations. so, if you have a mine inspector, then it seems to me that his liability might very well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the mine in accordance to federal safety standards.
that's  
correct, your honor. i think  
okay. so that's  
  but what about, you know, the basic first amendment  
but that was not reviewed by the ninth circuit.
well, except that, as i read his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best he could, on the second go-round.
i believe that it   i believe that it does, your honor. but i   i'm not sure the court even has to reach the uniformity argument in this case, because the fact that virginia military institute, on behalf of the commonwealth of virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.
appellate counsel on direct appeal attempted to raise it. he filed a motion requesting a   a remand. that motion was denied as   as improper. then in   once the conviction had been affirmed by the virginia court of appeals, by the supreme court of virginia, and review had been denied by this court, he went back and filed a collateral review claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for, among other things, failure to raise the vienna convention. the trial court denied that ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and then there was no   and then the decision was made not to pursue that   the appeal of the denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the supreme court of virginia.
it has to be just a clean water act standard.
in one circumstance, your honor. this suit allows a district that has been sued by individual water users to join the united states in the ongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to federal court if necessary, so there can be a determination of all the rights in those  
they could have done the same in 3731(c) also. instead of just saying any action brought under section 3730, they could have said any action brought under   which one? (a) of   of   which is the one that allows the government suit?
i thought your argument was, the single message is, "join the army, but not if you're gay."
right, and the question is he   i mean, the   the whole point here isn't the   isn't the interest in autonomy a separate interest which should be recognized by some means other than merely looking to the fairness of the trial.
and  
  interests.
well, what about the purchaser from jones? if   pardon me   from flowers. if flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is out of luck.
we have extended it in cases in which benefits were being denied. in justice stevens' hypothetical, and so far as i know in the kindergarten system in these cases, no educational benefit was being denied.
this is really respecting the states, which is what the   the purpose of this   of this whole provision was.
i think that that is the import of that portion of the question.
don't you think it has to issue an order? the state here, having received a judgment and   and seemingly a mandate has to issue after the judgment unless there's an order extending the time   went ahead with proceedings to   to set the execution, to have the   the person examined to be sure that he was competent to be executed, going through many stages, and was it proper for this court without   without ever issuing an order extending the time for the mandate, simply to come back   what   18 months later and say, oh, by the way?
if there's no market power, we're not alleging that, and we wouldn't try to bring that case, your honor. where the antitrust laws, as general clement says, have their reach is that they get the whole elephant. if we prove that the underwriters conspired as we alleged, and there's five administrative complaints here   it's not something where it's is a strike suit. there's five administrative complaints finding this parallel unlawful conduct, which would work best through a conspiracy. and we have our allegations in the complaint that they worked jointly together to do in this case what's always been prohibited under the securities laws.
so, you want us to interpret the text two ways, depending on the purpose.
right.
mr. stoepker, your friend, mr. hopper, would certainly not agree with you that   that a   a hydrological connection is the, quote, traditional test. what   what is your definition of tradition?
you never mentioned 101, though, did you?
but here there was no choice of picking up on the state?
but what about the reasoning in artuz that the application was   if it turns out later it was timely, it would have been properly filed?
i'm sorry. a particularized showing of what?
correct.
right. so the   that's what the different countries, the signatories, are supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a matter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries involved and not necessarily an individual enforceable right.
well, right.
no, your honor. the reason is, if somebody is injured in the course of a robbery, that's already punished as part of the robbery. in fact, the federal sentencing guidelines make clear that harms that are caused while committing a crime are punished as a part of that crime. you  
  we would argue that it would not make any difference, justice stevens, because this is a tax on distributors. it is   the legislature of kansas followed the specific advice of this court in its unanimous opinion in the chickasaw nation that if there is an issue with respect to the tax being imposed on   arguably burdening the tribe, the state can change the legal incidence of the tax. that's a  
okay. what's   what's happening here is in order to avoid the down side of your test   as justice o'connor puts it, her point is that if we adopt your rule, there's going to be an incentive not to state the reason. now, in order to avoid that   you haven't really squarely confronted it   i think you're suggesting that there has to be an additional rule that the police officer must say why he's arrested, and   and the authorities just don't establish that. now, if you want us to go on and make up that rule, i suppose we could make up that rule.
i believe we can rely  
well, it's interesting because post recuenco, after the washington supreme court's ruling in this case, yes, that would be an error because after the washington supreme court's decision in this case, what they said is that  
i   i think the distinction is   is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits or not. i think the distinction is between appeals of right and   and appeals that are discretionary.
that's a great question, and we   (laughter.)
mr. phillips, i may be lost a bit here. but i mean, which   i'm looking at the instructions that were given. and it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's part because it tracks the statutory language. the statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction says in whole or in part. so if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a typical proximate cause instruction?
you're too tall. [laughter.]
but if the concern is the safety concern, then you would have an equal concern with the jewish daily forward, which is a newspaper format, or   and i don't know what the watchtower comes out in these days.
then your answer, i take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because congress has not told it not to. is that it?
  for the purpose of reselling, if they can find customers.
i believe that's correct, your honor. i believe that   to me, the most natural reading of that language is that the district court, at least in the first instance, will have fact-finding authority as to what fees and other expenses were  
i think you're absolutely right that the court was not, at that point, thinking in terms of applying the speedy trial act.
the   i would say, in an ordinary dictionary definition, if you stand below the hoover dam and look up at it, you would say, "water is emitting from the dam. water is discharging from the dam," in an ordinary dictionary definition. i would agree with that. what i'm saying, though, is that if you keep in mind that it's not a reservoir emitting into a river, but it's a single river flowing through the dam, that water is not "discharging into" that water. that's what we're saying.
but there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.
he did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal. because of the  
no. the reason would be probably that the, if you can make a comparison. the number of government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect people's property. virtually, i mean the number of government actions affecting how people use their property, it's the whole series of law books. it fills the room. and suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's frightening me, which is what i said already. so you don't have to answer.
but is there a difference between the rights that could be asserted by the consul or a consulate official and the rights that could be asserted by a criminal defendant?
thank you, ms. grunder. mr. deixler, you have about three and a half minutes.
well, in part, i would say yes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade  
so it is an intrabranch dispute that can be resolved by the electorate essentially.
but your method   your method will over-emphasize the dry years. so either way you have a   a imperfect situation. in your case, year by year, and in a dry year, colorado perhaps must over compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row, then it's going to be   work out to colorado's disadvantage.
it has to be definitely   justice breyer, you're correct. it has to be  
i  
  it has  
on that  
yes, your honor, and we believe it was the proper course, but there is nothing in the complaint that says that we only want a total invalidation.
i'm just wondering how, how much help that will give the judge later on in processing the case.
it's   i'm sorry.
states don't like federal regulation  
i believe that is stated in the psr regarding the facts that they alleged under the attempted burglary, which again were objected to. specifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to, but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to, and both the district court and the eleventh circuit took that as being an objection to using anything regarding the attempted burglary.
well, one thing here  
thank you, ms. maynard. mr. cotter.
well, i   as i say, i think in the vast majority of cases, in both the federal system and ohio, that is the case. but even so, the consideration at issue takes into a broader spectrum of consideration than just the individual inmate. having the type of formal fact-finding retrospective proceeding that the court below required here is going to focus the decision-maker in the wrong direction and on a more narrow set of facts than ideally we want the prison administrators to focus upon. we want them to be looking at, just like in hewitt, the relationship of this inmate to other inmates, of inmates within the prison generally, of inmates to this inmate, and the safety of others. so there's more of them at stake. there are other private interests at stake besides those of the individual who may be moved in the prison administration's  
rightly so, i think. i mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.
okay? there are billions of them. so the real question is do they have to give a justification for this. and the argument that they don't is simply that it's not in the person's house. when you go out in a public place, even in your car, you might run into people or animals with sharp noses. and a lot of them can detect marijuana. and you know, maybe it's a limburger cheese. i don't know. (laughter.)
i   i   this may   may be important to me for understanding your argument. i   i didn't quite understand the hypothetical. you   you want him to keep the place in line or it's dangerous for him to keep the place in line?
well  
no, no, but   no, i'm not getting your answer. are you telling me that it is the law in chicago, for example, that if a policeman responds to a call, a call of   it's ambiguous   what it says is, "an anonymous caller said there's an odd situation next door. will you check out 2355 maple street?" he goes there. the wife looks a little oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table, and she says, "officer, i'd like you to come upstairs with me." the husband says no. are you saying that the law is clear in chicago that the policeman can't do it?
the  
because  
well, the super scoop was not moving at that moment, but the scow was moving  
i do and here's why, first, 25 starting with the language before i turn to the policy 1 side of your question. on the language, paragraph (4), the fourth 3 trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a 4 variety of circumstances, things from ineffective 5 assistance of counsel, to brady violations, to vacaturs. 6 i'll grant you that if congress only intended the vacatur 7 situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder 8 why they chose those particular words, but we know they 9 didn't intend this one circumstance. i think the government's position as to discover 11 boils down to this. because the answer to the question, 12 when could the vacatur have been discovered through 13 reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong. 14 and we don't believe that to be the case. we think that 15 you can easily ask when could the vacatur have been 16 discovered through the exercise of reasonable  
then what you are really arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with foreign sovereign immunities.
  in our view, it would have to constitute  
congress gave the fcc power in 276 to come up with a plan. but this case, as the ninth circuit decided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the question is whether failing to comply with the administrative plan  
thank you mr. richard, mr. kellogg, you have four minutes remaining.
but the jury  
  where the conviction has been invalidated for that reason.
well, i   i don't want to get lost in   in rhetoric here. isn't it still the case, even on your theory, that the defendant in these circumstances makes a choice? it may be a troubled choice, a much more difficult choice to make than it would be otherwise, but the defendant still makes a choice as to whether to cave in to the third party's pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not. isn't that true even on your theory?
  subjectively true. and so, i'd simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and there is a finding that the defendant   here, we have 30 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said, "he said he can't talk to us. we can't do anything about it." we have that. is there anything else?
thank you, ms. robin-vergeer. ms. lee, you have 3 minutes remaining.
okay. and, your honor, looking at it in context, given the district attorney's argument, the district attorney says, "i can't imagine you won't be told that it doesn't   that it   that it doesn't fit within factor (k)." so, the defense attorney gets up and says, "i'm   i am going to tell you that it doesn't within   fit within factor (k). it doesn't"  
green v. georgia where they came in with inconsistent positions.
don't you want us to exclude this ultimate employment decision? i think that's one thing. in order to win, you have to say what counts is the suspension and not the ultimate decision.
no, because i think what you're looking at is not voluntariness. you're looking at knowing. did this suspect know that the questioning was going to stop?
thank you, mr. landau.
  this question.
why? why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district court said i have   these people are totally immune from suit; therefore, i have no jurisdiction over them.
our view is if they want to arbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their   in their pocket. we do not believe  
okay, not   not for his regular gs salary.
what has our constitutional law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to consider all mitigating factors   the requirement that they have to be allowed to be take into account of that   what guidance has that provided? has our constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating factor?
your honor, in taylor, this court was clear that under enumerated burglary or generic burglary, the offense becomes a   has that serious potential risk when the person actually enters the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an attempted burglary, at least in florida and in most other states, that act has not occurred. you haven't entered, the defendant has not entered the property.
  the government's message, the message is, "join the army." is that right?
yes.
mr. waxman, we really have to examine your   you know, your allegations, i suppose, one at a time. it makes it a very complicated case. the   the state's response to   to your argument that two of   of the state's attorneys involved in this case had been found to have made racially based strikes in the past   the state's response to that is that that was not part of the evidence presented in state court, and therefore, it   it is not a proper consideration in reviewing the state court decision. what   what is your response to that?
no, justice scalia.
so, but you're saying this   this is an ad hoc thing. there is no general practice about which one goes first.
it goes to the full committee.
yes, other volvo dealers.
i   i mean, i guess we would   we would resist the notion that we're making it all up. that is, whenever congress   whenever this court attempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make them   in order that they would make sense taken together, the result is likely to be that neither statute will be read in precisely  
how do you define tributary?
well, justice breyer, let me answer that question in two parts, which is to say that i think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a serious suspension clause problem, for the simple reason that i think deferring review or channeling it to the court of appeals does not amount to a suspension.
  or  
48 hours  
no, but this is   this is a 3 special case. this is not a general argument to the 4 effect that this is a very bad person and we can expect 5 bad persons to be bad in the future. this is a more 6 specific argument. this is an argument that says he's now 7 done it twice. this is the second crime and he's getting 8 better at it as he goes along because now he kills the 9 witnesses. this isn't just generalized badness. this is 10 criminal repetitiveness. it is recidivism. and it seems 11 to me that that is a much clearer argument. it is much 12 closer to the explicit argument that he will do it in the 13 future.
but   but, again, in neder, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that was litigated to it and based on the parties' understanding of what offense was at issue. in this case, that doesn't happen. and, again, it's illustrated by the prosecutor's response to mr. recuenco's motion to vacate, and it's illustrated by the court's judgment and sentence, which is at page 14 of the joint appendix, where it specifically finds that the only verdict   and   and again, doesn't question the verdict   that the only verdict returned was deadly weapon other than a firearm. it doesn't assume that the jury found that it was the firearm verdict. it doesn't make that assumption. it recognizes that verdict for what it was. but based on then-existing washington law, which recuenco overturned, it concluded it had to impose the firearm enhancement. so there's no suggestion by either the parties or the trial court or the washington supreme court, for that matter, that there was anything wrong with the jury returning a verdict of deadly weapon because, as a matter of washington law and as recognized by each of those   those entities, the jury   the jury could do that, and they did. refusing to apply harmless error in this case doesn't require a single retrial of a single individual. unlike the normal case, unlike neder itself, in   in those cases, had harmless error not applied, the defendants would have been entitled to a new trial. that's not true after blakely. at best, what would happen is   is defendants would be remanded back to   to the various trial courts for the reentry of the sentence that's supported by the   the jury's verdict. there will be no need to conduct new trials. there will be no need to do anything, other than that simple ministerial act. there simply is no prudential reason. there won't be the flood of   of retrials or   or the prison doors thrown open for   for people to walk free with no convictions.
may i interrupt you at this point? because there is one thing that i'm not sure that i understand about your position, and one way of reading your brief takes you a step beyond what you have just said. so i would like to get clear on this. and i understood your argument to be that given the safeguards such as judicial override, there simply was no   there was no need to read the health exception in, that in fact it was taken care of   any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for the need for health exception in fact were addressed by the statute. the point at which i'm not clear on your position is   occurs in what you've said on page 11 of your yellow brief, if you could get that out. do you have the carry over paragraph on 11? you go through the kind of a worst case analysis. and you say, well, you know, assuming that all of the safeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the unlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the 48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who performs an emergency abortion under such circumstances would not be subject to either criminal prosecution or civil liability because his or her conduct would not only be constitutionally protected but would be independently justifiable, and then you cite the competing harms. what do you mean when you say it would be constitutionally protected? i read that as suggesting that there was indeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of a health exception, but that may not be what you meant. what do you mean by constitutionally protected? what are you getting at?
i think we can. i think both the 8 interpretations of each of those contested words are 9 strict interpretations right within the plain meaning. 10 and our case can boil down to asking whether there's 11 something wrong with my english language when i say, on 12 what day could the vacatur have been discovered through 13 the exercise of due diligence. it's  
yeah  
what about moore?
what about fraud in the inducement?
well, mr. flaxman, is your argument limited to that situation, where there is no evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other than the illegally seized evidence? or would it apply in some situations in which there is some additional evidence?
and out-of-state, there is a deduction for fuel sold out-of-state. that's logical, because the purpose for the tax is to pay for the roads in kansas, and it's  
that's correct, mr. chief justice, but i believe that the analogy applies because it still goes to whether or not you start reading the act beyond the jurisdictional grant. it's unnecessary to go beyond the jurisdictional grant because  
  your pitch.
your honor, i think this court has looked at that issue in   in two separate cases, and one of those cases is crawford fitting and the other is  
but general   general clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract. wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't bring a preenforcement challenge as to that. maybe it's a question of hemorrhaging, that   it's a combination of what the condition is and the official vulnerability of the particular patient and i don't see how that could be tested in advance.
do you think williamson county by its terms spoke of going to state court and   rather than just a state administrative proceeding?
as a matter of washington law and as of the fact that this is, indeed, an element of a greater offense, there is a requirement on the state to come forward with additional proof of the capacity to fire.
well, in   in the ordinary civil context, that's perhaps correct, your honor, but   but this isn't the ordinary civil context. this is the habeas context. and congress has said that this is the structure that we want to take. this is the rule that we want to take. and as this court has recognized that   that aedpa was passed with   with this enduring respect for finality, this respect for the sovereignty of states. state, you're only going to have to come back here one time. you're only supposed to litigate one time, one   all the claims in one basket. they're brought within 1 year, and the state is to defend its judgment one time because  
what we are talking about   to answer the first portion of your question, justice ginsburg, i think ultimately the citizens of the state of new york pay but it is, the judgment would be against either the state of new york or the against the counties in the land claim. in this case  .
what's your other reason?
in your view, just as a practical matter, what we have here, how   how should the states enforce this obligation?
and the question of integration, whether there was any use of a racial criterion, whether integration, using racial integration is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the brown decision. they were, at last, white and black children together on the same school bench. that seems to be worlds apart from saying we'll separate them.
it has to be a real claim. it can't be if i have a claim.
but would  
you don't want to just save half of this program, do you?
but, mr. fisher, even if it's true that there are other examples out there that might qualify for that example, it's not true of this case?
well, that is certainly correct, justice scalia, but in our view, there is no constitutional problem here. and the reason that there is no constitutional problem here is in making the probabilistic determination that is required by the reform act, a court is taking the allegations in the complaint as true. it is not engaging in any weighing of the evidence.
so, the question is whether we should construe the word "the" to be the functional equivalent of "his or her."
if the dispute were to go to arbitration   there are very limited provisions for judicial review in the event there is a decision   could the constitutional claim still go to court?
that is one of the purposes, yes. in that   in the case that was decided immediately after the young's market, mahoney, and indianapolis brewing, the court said, "discrimination is permissible in this narrow context, where the state is acting pursuant to its twenty first amendment powers and regulating importation of alcohol."
no, i'm not saying that it was not made. i'm saying that a state court disposed of that claim without doing a factual trial, but simply based on the allegations in the complaint.
i don't think that's right. and if you're enforcing a contract and you're seeking normal contractual damages of various sorts, you definitely do that legally and not equitably. but equity always enforced contracts. they would enforce its equitable liens that were created by contract. for example, in the case of walker against brown, which was not an attorney's fees case   by the way, on   in barnes against alexander, which was an attorney's fees case, nowhere in the decision does the court rely at all on the fact that this had anything to do with any special rule that applies to attorney's fees. but that, in turn, relied on the prior case of walker against brown in which   just involved an equitable lien that was created by contract and that a party was trying to enforce. and the court quoted pomeroy's treatise. now, walker was decided in 1897. pomeroy's treatise on equity, quote, every express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular property, real or personal, or fund therein described or identified as a security for a debt, creates an equitable lien upon the property so described.
this court has not decided what the proper remedy would be there, your honor. and the cases  
sure you would. sure you would.
yes.
why not say, depending on the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, why not just say congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the federal system, for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but rather significant and important rights attach in the federal court that do not attach in the state court. and therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when they   when what is at stake is immune or not, and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers.
there was a   a point that you were in the process of answering. the   the argument is made that this tying product had such clout that you were able to extract not twice but three times the price for the tied product. and you were saying no to even double the price.
well, the extent is   it's a question that can't be answered in the abstract. it's a question of how material the variance was.
sure.
right.
no, the   no, they haven't. but right before the 2004 election   excuse me   they gave an exception to an auto dealership that wanted to continue to run the name of the owner of the dealership, despite the fact that he was a senator   a candidate for united states senate, during the blackout period. and the commercial interests at stake there were sufficient for the fec to grant an as-applied exception even though there may have been some incidental effect on the election. so the fec has recognized that there is interests which are sufficient and   and also that the   the possible impact on an election is so remote that   that the interests are   are sufficient.
  under your view.
justice scalia, i respectfully disagree because alaska, unlike texas, has political party registration. also, they have a party option. and most states that have political party registration, in fact, have a sort of two-tier system where they recognize it would be discriminatory to treat major parties and small political parties the same. most of them like, for example, the amici states here of new mexico, maryland, they have political conventions for their   they recognize that that is something that shouldn't be applied to the smaller parties. but oklahoma, of course, mandates primaries. the libertarians of oklahoma are forced to have primaries. they're forced to live under what is the most restrictive ballot access and ballot retention laws, which limits the amount of time they could be on the ballot. the voter registration laws, as was cited in the record of this case, as the trial judge found, of the 29 states that have political party registration, essentially 26 of them have   they have free and open registration. there are very few that limit things across the board like oklahoma does, and that's what makes this case unique. and i think the footnote 13 in tashjian talked about looking at the particular facts and circumstances. i think this case gives the court an opportunity to fully expand on that footnote, the full footnote, of course, as i cited in the brief for the respondents, and that is to say that all these are factors when you're analyzing any state. is   does it have political party registration? does it mandate primaries for even the little parties? how much time is available to change your registration as new parties come up? the new   state of new hampshire, of course, has found a way to deal with this problem, which oklahoma hasn't, which is that they allow new parties that are just recognized. where many voters didn't have the opportunity to register in that party, they have an open primary. that's one way to deal with it. but the point is oklahoma didn't even think about that. as we pointed out in our brief, the sore loser provision where you have to be affiliated with a party for 6 months   the legislature   when the first time the libertarians got on the ballot 25 years ago, they didn't even realize that there was no way you could be affiliated with a party for 6 months because you couldn't register with it. and the law and the workings of all these registration laws in oklahoma, because they are so restrictive, prevent the libertarian party to get in the position that the major parties have because they simply can't get their people registered and stay registered with the libertarian party because they're constantly being purged and they're   the people are frustrated.
oh, no, i'm not talking about going beyond it. i just thought that line between definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as i would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the 1854 case of samuel f. b. morse, they're making the same kind of argument and, indeed, you translated morse as a definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's the kind of argument they're making.
and then person x wanted to join  
if you, if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something, when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way?
  for violations?
the gun was in the   in the chair, but he was only convicted for the drugs in his pocket.
no, your honor. i'm   i'm not suggesting that.
a. oh.
and yet, it   it provides an unusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison context to get religion. if you can find some religious group that espouses drinking beer every day or other alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana or no telling what or having certain clothing or other things that would alter the conditions of the prison environment, there's a real incentive here to get religion. (laughter.)
but they happened at the same time, didn't they? the  
mr. chief justice, that would be the case. and certainly if that one application, in that one potential rare case was found not to be valid, then the remainder of the applications can go forward. and that is how most cases work with respect to as-applied relief.
but at the guilt stage, is there any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the family members to display this message to a jury throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a risk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider improper influences in reaching its verdict? is there any question?
here is the exact words i   i think. it's   tell me. this certainly seems to be right. the inmate shall be served with notice at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of a hearing. the notice shall include all of the reasons for the proposed placement  
and then you engage in the inquiry. but that's significant, justice stevens, because these individuals are represented by counsel.
and in respect to there being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able to raise the price over what it otherwise would be. and why not then make that a defense, that a person could say, i have a valueless patent, and he could introduce evidence to prove it?
but my first question is how does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680 says shall not apply to   to things in the exception?
mr. coleman, can i interrupt with a question?
which is what edwards is directing.
i don't understand that. i mean, if it was really the case that they were going to be losing, losing profits, i think they would have been here. i mean, we talk about the wal-marts and the targets. they're not here on amicus briefs because they're   what they're selling is cheap. they are selling price, and people who want low price and for whom that's of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores. so they're not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price   of course, they'll try to keep the price as low as possible   but service. i just don't see what, what harm can possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, from allowing some people to make their money on service and   rather than cheap price.
must there be good reason for that? and, if not, aren't you asking us to waste our time?
  has considered  
well, your honor, i think the rules of court are viewed as a whole with 4.408, which talks about anything in addition to   that the rules of   the examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant, that anything can be a consideration.
yes, justice scalia, but i don't think that anyone would ever do that in a rule of reason section 1 analysis. what they'd look at in a rule of reason section 1 analysis is whether the combined entity would have the sufficient market power to engage in supracompetitive pricing. this court has repeatedly said in section 1 cases it doesn't ask whether the specific price set is a reasonable price  
  as i understand it, and as the solicitor general confirmed, you are subject to the rehabilitation act, where the substantive scope is the same. so, what   you are saying, in the prison context, this is undue, but you all   you are already subject to it under one act. and how has that been working out?
i   he   my assumption, your honor, is he had this.
so, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?
as far as the other states go, yes, your honor. and i believe the impact on california would be a requirement of a secondary trial after the main trial. but it would also impose a burden of trying to identify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever relevant considerations have to take place in this particular case, which can be a multitude of things. in california law, essentially anything can   anything can justify an upper term sentence. it's only when there's absolutely nothing, not a scintilla of justification, that an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore reversed.
and   and it seems to me that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.
but that's what i thought i was trying to say. i mean, am i getting it wrong? because this is the  
we are not making the argument.
well, that   we did cite from the rule. that is correct. when the order came out   well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just looking at the date, something had to be done. and of course, we filed on one day before the end date  
i don't believe that's the case at all, your honor.
a lot of money in building homes.
that's   that's correct, your honor.
i thought it said "reasonableness."
a union or group of individuals.
well, there was an entitlement to recover. now, there might have been a dispute as to the proper amount or whether that claim was valid, but he was entitled to recover based on the injury he suffered that was cognizable at law and that gave raise to a cause of action. now, in exchange for legal services, he promised to pay a portion of the recovery to the lawyer. that is a promise to pay a fee. that is not an assignment or any other transfer of the underlying cause of action. and it is undisputed, i think  
i have special responses, your honor. the objection to the special verdict form and the special issues was made plain in pretrial motions and that objection was clearly recognized by the trial judge at trial and denied at trial when the instructions were being considered for the purposes of voir dire.
thank you, mr. gornstein. mr. tillinghast.
and can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is wrong?
okay. so, i don't know what i'm doing with california procedure when i pass a   pass a law, is what it would be. write a rule, write a presumption. i have no idea what i'm doing there. they've worked out a system. but i don't   why doesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, "do your job"? what we said   and maybe it wasn't expressed clearly   maybe   "courts, look, it says 'reasonable time.' all right? now, reasonable time, in every other state is 30 days, sometimes 20 days."
go back to my hypothetical. supposing you have the first two elements and you say in order to drive this company out of business we want you to compete with them and get the logs at whatever cost it takes. would that be an anticompetitive act?
right. and   and if i may, the   the special statutes that govern the parole of mariel cubans that we reproduce in the appendix to our brief at 212.12 were promulgated in 1987 before 1231(a)(6) was enacted in 1996.
i know that. that isn't it. i have a question about   i have a question about the merits.
but then, the  
i'm more than  
detained beyond the   the length of the search. and so i think technically the judgment can be affirmed on that ground. but with respect to the handcuffing, the position that we would say is that, first of all, you   you would have to view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. now, it's been   there's been a lot of questioning about what that means and what the jury's role is. as we understand it, if ornelas applies to this decision, which we assume the court would do   and that is, that you would first have to take the light   all the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, including the possibility that the   the jury rejected as being incredible the statements that the officers made in terms of justification, if there was evidence in the record to show that there was contradicting evidence, which there is in this record. and so the facts that   that the other side has tried to argue are the facts on which you would make that constitutional decision are not the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was   there was lots of planning. there was a tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which said that the   the plan here was to go in and make the swat entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. they would be patted down, identified, and released. the jury was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that they didn't say when they were going to be released and believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it was ascertained that they did not have the connection in   in the situation. and in fact, there's testimony from the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime. and they were completely cooperative, and they didn't resist arrest and they didn't flee. and iris mena is 5 foot 1   5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of exactly how they looked. the officers had a total plan. they   they exercised their command of the situation from the beginning. they cleared it. they made sure it was safe. they took people outside through the pouring rain, which actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.
that's beginning to happen, your honor. in australia and great britain, there   i believe it has been  
and the   and the main failing there is that volvo trucks and reeder-simco do not compete in the same market for sales of volvo trucks. is that a correct statement of the record?
  that he was in before.
and you're not going to throw out the prosecution just because this one piece of information was bad.
  what?
it was a nonrenewal.
well, as a matter of oregon law, we think we can   we could put mom on, she could testify verbatim from her original trial, and she could be asked, or she could say, "and i love my son. please don't kill him."
what   what about a  
and their   but it is  
and so i mean, i think, they may not have made that an independent basis of reversal but we've got to consider it.
yes.
how long did it take them to find out whether the   these other dangerous people were there?
the city of sherrill is not a party in the land claim litigation. the land claim litigation  
  juvenile facilities from their  
yes. i'm really expanding on that point, that it didn't   the fcc has always gotten deference for what   determining what is unjust and unreasonable under the act. and it didn't require a great deal of explanation. the fcc's explanation here was more than adequate in light of its years of explanation about why this   this scheme with these rates and these carriers and the primary economic beneficiary being the one who pays. all of that were reasons why this was fair compensation. once it decided all of that, it didn't take much to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust and unreasonable. that was adequately explained and didn't require a huge additional amount of explanation.
  if we're going to go further and say, "oh, well, we find that that's what the state law is, unless they tell us differently," that's where i'm having trouble.
thank you, ms. woodman. general kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.
well, cable   cable media companies may   may have congress' ear more readily than   than   you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any  
it could take for all time, your honor. i think it would be a very close question as to whether that could survive appellate review. that may well be an abuse of discretion to find, after having let the matter   delayed the matter already 10 months, to grant another 3 months for that purpose.
why isn't the power to reconvert sufficient?
yes, sir.
your honor, the   that issue is not before this court  
well, then why did you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?
i wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that i got from something that justice scalia said. i don't know whether he was making it or not, but i'll make the suggestion and see what you think. suppose that this case   suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: you cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the defendant for something he did official to a different person who wasn't there. now   so he couldn't defend against him. that person didn't present a claim. so we are certain of that. now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here. it may have done. there is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way. so we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened. whether it happened and what happened is a matter of oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc. now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?
it is not the claim of ineffective assistance.
i think that there's a point beyond which, for institutional reasons, it would be very problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons would be, i think, an instance of under-enforcement of a constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick, to get some people to support speech they don't believe in, that would be there. but the difficulty of having this court enforce that principle, i think, would be very real. but no such difficulty, i think, is presented in a case like this one, because if this case came out their way because of government speech, of course, united foods would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be obliterated, because the theory would have to be that because it's not on your license plate, because you don't have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's all the difference in the world. because, otherwise, its being government speech would make it worse. but if it's all the difference in the world whether you have to carry or utter it, or merely support it, then all of the decisions of this court carefully protecting the rights of dissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from the powerful overriding theory that collective-action problems mean that we've really got to get more speech over here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in  
your honor, if that were the case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a generic term with no protection.
i seriously question whether or not a crucifix would be constitutionally acceptable in that same location, and for the very same reasons which i'm articulating why the ten commandments would be acceptable in this location. the crucifix is not like the ten commandments in that it's not an historically recognized symbol of law. it doesn't send a secular message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they are believers or not believers of the important role the ten commandments have played in the development of law.
certainly. first of all, the state has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, with jury unanimity, that the defendant is guilty of capital murder. and kansas has one of the most narrow death-penalty statutes in the nation. and then, past that time, we then engage in a sentencing  
why does she have to show that is invalid as distinct from showing that another trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not created because of the tortious conduct of your client?
yes, you may save your time.
and that   and that   that's post   that's post-crime.
what do you do about   about the provision not of 41(b) but of 41(d)(2)? there had been a petition for certiorari here, which was denied.
one religion singled out. and, therefore, i'm looking for some way in this treaty not to reach that conclusion  
if it was   if it was unfavorable to the plaintiff. on the eeoc standard, it would be if it deterred an individual from filing a charge. and, justice scalia, we have cited favorably the eeoc standard. what we were asked to do here  
well, surely submitting false identification could be a overt act. official
but do you   do you agree with this much, that if   if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed.
  it doesn't. but even then, it's not   it doesn't run from that date, and the   he's   and the   the petitioner has the   the applicant has no date on   if he's past his 1 year from the date the conviction became final, he has no date on which he can rely to make his application timely. and our primary submission  
mr. ravenell  
but not the same underlying question, justice ginsburg, with respect, because then you are in a situation like the business forms case in the seventh circuit, which came out shortly after the lear. there was a settle   settlement, and the   and it was argued that the settlement was not effective because of the lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out of the lear decision. but that is all under 12(b)(6), and not 12(b)(1). this case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a 12(b)(6)  
yes, your honor.
and it just doesn't say anything about them at all.
but he would only pay the fee based on his mileage in the state. it is not a flat fee if it is put onto the irp fees. those  
i didn't say all that.
  we're trying to  
justice scalia, the court made a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from the tube had spilt after   after the blood had been tested. it did not, however, make a factual finding. it made a conclusion of law regarding that, your honor.
well, it does have this, that what   if you look at the definition of "telecommunications," it means "transmitting information without change in the form or content of the information." now, in respect to some of their services   not, maybe, a lot, but in response to some   they certainly change the content and the form. e-mail, for example, does. and there are a number of others that do. so the language, says the fcc   i look to "telecommunications service." they provide telecommunications service sometimes, and sometimes this other thing, as well, and it's all bundled. and we read the word "offering" to mean "offering separately." and so, therefore, a person who offers only a bundled service is not a person who's offering a telecommunications service. that's how i read it, as trying to understand their argument. and it seemed to me that argument is logical, and it fits the language. now, why is it   are   do you agree that it is logical and fits the language, and at least get them that far, or not?
your honor, i think we're the same as the seventh circuit. we may have articulated it slightly different, but yes, they are different standards.
  failed legislative efforts. and if  
absolutely not, justice scalia, not in civil litigation. and that's why the state secrets privilege is, i mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the civil side of the case.
yes.
well, i thought the issue was whether the court of appeals for the federal circuit correctly determined the scope of the exemption. if they were wrong about it, then it is open to us to correct that and send it back.
the civil trial will be stayed pending the  
and   and by keeping in the exclusions, by   by looking at 924(e)(1) where it   what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you have three prior drug   serious drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. those three prior three drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1) are state or federal drug offenses by definition. it seems to me that it really couldn't be any more clear. and frankly, to the extent it's not totally clear and it could go either way, i think then the rule of lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow construction, that is, that any court meant any court of the state or of the united states. i believe it was in the   in the '90's when this court's opinion, authored by justice thomas in i think it was called alvarez-sanchez, dealt with a statute, 3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in federal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if they're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6 hours after the arrest. and the issue what does any mean in terms of any law enforcement official. and the court said it means any state or federal law enforcement official. now, it didn't have to reach the issue of whether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but certain things are obvious without an   an explanation. and you're right. there was some sloppy drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd to think, when we look   and   and maybe these anomalies won't occur all the time, as you point out, justice breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the list under 922(g)(1), that congress was talking about any court in the world. now  
which would be california. and i do think, with respect, mr. chief justice, that the california supreme court   i'm sorry   the ninth circuit made clear that it was applying california preclusion law. it cited the california supreme   a   california authorities, and it correctly recited the elements of the california preclusion law in this regard. it did make reference to its prior determination in dodd v. hood river, which was an oregon case, in which the ninth circuit decided that an england reservation in the williamson county context was effective with respect to claim preclusion but not issue preclusion. and in that respect   and this i think goes back to justice o'connor's question about, you know, what   what could we have been thinking or not thinking in williamson county   the   the dodd case provides a pretty good example. at the time this court decided williamson county, many, probably most states did not have a substantive takings jurisprudence that was akin to the federal standard. for example, california itself, new york didn't provide compensation for regulatory takings at all. in those states, there would be no question of either claim or issue preclusion because in the course of deciding whether or not compensation was due under state law, there would be few, if any, common issues decided. now, as the ninth circuit explained in dodd v. hood river, oregon recognizes   in the context of regulatory takings, recognizes an agins type claim, that is where you are completely denied all economic value to your   i'm sorry   a lucas claim, but they don't recognize the penn central standard. they don't provide compensation unless you are denied all economic value.
but if they're flatly contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that .109(a) has lesser status? that's what it boils down to, isn't it?
yes, your honor, it would. that's   the state laws requires that any licensed winery have a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room   storehouse   storeroom or warehouse, pardon me  
yes, sir, it is. it's   the   the facts were in this case, though, all night long they had ridden around looking for someone to rob. they made a statement in tupelo  
i'd like to get back just for a moment  
in which case, they   they might well revise the language of their rule.
well, if a  
i'm not sure i completely held it in   in my mind.
that's correct.
the immunity question, the immunity question is the same as state or federal court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign sovereign, china, whatever, is as immune from state court jurisdiction as it is from federal court jurisdiction because congress said so. but with respect to the commercial enterprise, congress said, we're going to give you a federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial. that doesn't apply to state courts.
i'm sorry, your honor. is that   was that an observation or a question?
we would   we would be pleased to   to prevail under   under turner, justice stevens. it seems that consistent with the court's teachings under the fourteenth amendment and the most recent considerations by the court of equal protection and strict scrutiny, that the use of race by california in this context should trigger a strict scrutiny analysis, should lead to an analysis of whether there has been narrow tailoring. but under the turner test, we believe properly applied, the petitioner should prevail as well. under the turner test, it seems that at least two of the four elements which are announced in turner couldn't possibly be met here. the first one is it seems to be no   there is no reasonable relationship between the government regulation which is at issue and the announced policy. the notion that one can determine by race alone a violent propensity seems irrational, unreasonable, and contrary to the only empirical evidence which exists, the trulson study.
they have.
well, your honor, our case is simply that where a material element is omitted the grand jury   something went wrong in the grand jury proceeding, and the only remedy for that is to return it, the case, to the grand jury and let them have a second go  
is it on one  
well, let me say a couple of things about that. first of all, the oregon supreme court did not rely on this aspect. it held that it was official proper to punish for harm to nonparties. now this, in our view, this instruction, and there's always a danger when you add words to an instruction that you will add something that a court will find was incorrect and therefore deny the instruction, even though the essence of it was correct.
well, that's bridge immunity, not sovereign immunity. i mean  
well, your honor, in this case, the   the inmate miller-el has the burden. he had the burden in the trial court. he had the burden to prove purposeful discrimination, and he could have put   he did put the questionnaires of the 10 challenged jurors in the record. he did not  
  side by side with the rest of the 10-year bar.
yes.
does california have, or have not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical case where a senior attorney who tells a junior attorney lie to the court  
but you're not relying on that in this cause of action.
i'm sorry. you have two minutes remaining.
mr. hungar, do you  
in california   well, first of all, if this is new jurisprudence to you, or unfamiliar, the critical difference is that most states, and most of this court's jurisprudence, uses the term "aggravating factor" and "eligibility factor" interchangeably, because in most states, and particularly in the "weighing" states, "aggravating factor" is the eligibility factor that makes the defendant eligible for death, but it's also the sole, or primary, factor that the jury is to take into consideration on the side militating in favor of death. in california, we have "eligibility factors," which are the special circumstances, and those happen at the guilt phase of the trial. and then we have "sentencing factors," 11 factors that are totally different from the special circumstances or  
may i ask you this? if the   if the day before the settlement was consummated, the plan had gone into court and had said the   the beneficiaries plan to settle the case and they've indicated that they're not going to give us any of the settlement in accordance with the terms of the contract and we want an injunction preventing their distribution to anyone but   but us, if the   if the judge believed that and believed that under the contract, the plan was entitled to reimbursement, could the judge have enjoined the   the distribution of the funds to the   you know, to the extent of the plan's claim?
well, i think the  
well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case.
well, you don't have any case law to cite to us for that. that gets us into a whole new doctrine.
at the trial court, the  
but, of course, you can afford to be very rigorous at step two because your threshold at step one is high. the threshold is   if the threshold at step one is   is easier to cross, then we could be more rigorous at   at step two.
yes.
so in 1958, under   if   if you follow the chief justice's question, in 1958 when it became possible for corporations to be citizens of more than one state, maybe the meaning of this statute that was passed in 1948 changed. i   i don't think that makes sense. we're   we're trying to interpret a statute that congress passed in 1948. at that time, there was complete parity. the fact that in 1958 congress perceived a problem which is not a problem with national banks, where there was a divergence, a serious divergence, between the place of incorporation and the principal place of business that congress said we've got to deal with this problem. and so they amended section 1332 in 1958 to deal with that particular problem. that is not a problem that affects national banks. so there's been no occasion. when they enacted riegle-neal, there was no   no need for them to change  
i'm not sure the framers used controlled deliveries either. (laughter.)
is it   is it   is the time when the arrestee must told you are being arrested for x reason, is that when the arrestee appears before the magistrate or is it earlier when he's brought into the police station and he's booked? the arrest is booked. at which point?
i   i   maybe i should clarify. i   i think that you have to compare the wesley trial with the stumpf trial.
if it is time  
i do not agree with that. i think that the application of harmless error analysis, when it's predicated on a misunderstanding of federal constitutional law, is not an independent basis for decision. it's clearly wrapped up in the federal claim, and i think this court's cases have clearly so held.
  "what i put in the appendix."
no. just to say that this   what happened here was not a final determination. take an analog   an analogy to rule 54(b). the judge can say, yes, i've made this ruling and it sticks. you see, i'm going to give you a separate piece of paper that says judgment, but if i don't give you that separate piece of paper, even though i said judgment granted, it doesn't count until the very end of the case. i can always change my mind. why shouldn't it operate the same way on the criminal side?
  my understanding is "some" is a great understatement, yes. the bands talked about at 159 and 169 to '70 of the joint appendix, which have authorized their live concert recordings to be traded among   on   to be traded. the gigamerica business is in the business of compiling   this is at 323 of the joint appendix   of compiling musical recordings and other things for authorized distribution. the world of music distribution and video distribution and movie-trailer distribution and, in small instances now, text distribution, but growing, is changing and making use of this extremely innovative, low-cost tool. the great innovation of this tool of communication  
no, it's not.
i think not   i think not used in that sense, but i think it's important   it's important to look at the language, as a whole. it does not say "punishable as a felony under"  
well, let's take it step by step. suppose the police articulate this at the outset  
that's correct.
and that is not sufficient because in our view the complaint needs to allege some facts that demonstrate a basis for believing there was an unlawful agreement within  
if that's so, why isn't their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the complete answer to your position?
all right. then suppose he alleged not that it was forged, but that this   that the occupier of the land had   had misconstrued the occupier's rights to bid at the tax sale or   or that there   the tax sale should never have been held. then that's a federal  
see, this is really a unique statute in so many ways. we've learned, over the years, that discrimination is being treated like everybody else in this   in this statute, unusual discrimination. and i'm just wondering, it's   i find it surprising and significant that those who have been free to pick the right rule have picked the rule your opponent  
that doesn't  
did our prior smith cases go that far? i'm not aware that  
now, is exclusion of evidence in these circumstances a deterrent, so that the police would be less likely to do that?
no, not at all. what you're saying is that the evidence has to be   the admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light of the circumstances. if your claim of innocence is, as it may be in this case, that the dna evidence doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that evidence comes in. if the evidence you're trying to get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that somebody else did it, and the   and you don't challenge the dna evidence that places your client there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable inference, while it might in a different case, depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.
disappearing. not just not appearing. disappearing.
gee, i   i find that extraordinary that   i claim to have been defrauded by somebody. he makes a representation to me about the value of stock. i don't believe it. i really think it's ridiculous. of course, the stock is not worth that. okay? i buy it anyway, and i can sue even though i didn't believe him?
we think that this court can resolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness of epa's construction of the increased hours exclusion. what it can't do is certainly what the fourth circuit did, which is to say that the psd regulations must be the same. they are obviously not the same. they are different in multiple respects. and certainly that challenge could have been raised, and certainly that challenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals expressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts and interpretations of the regulations. that's exactly what a court is supposed to be doing.
  since the very  
to be sure.
mr. phillips, the problem i continue to have is that i thought steiner embraced, explicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable. you take issue with that, but do you want us to overrule steiner  
i   i believe that the day you overpay something, just like in the sigafus, just in the   in the bolles case, both of them had to do with gold mines  
in   in many cases, yes, your honor. again, the   the drafters recognized that remedies would be local, and so the question is for our system, for the united states system, how does the united states system   how does it remedy breaches? and it depends upon the type of the breach. in this instance, the breach here involved statements, and so the breach occurred when the authorities did not inform mr. sanchez-llamas of his right to contact the consulate.
yes, your honor, he does get that notice. he gets that basic form that basically says he's being reclassified.
well, you should be arguing, then, that we should give chevron deference to the commission's interpretation of section 208. and once we do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.
but what   what is the answer to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that case? isn't your expectation of privacy identical, whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or not?
yes, all right. i thought that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of attempt law. then i thought it's unlikely   but here you can correct me. the u.s. code is filled with the word "attempt." just opening it at random, there are attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there. is it the government's practice whenever they charge a violation of any of these provisions to not just use the word "attempt," but to use the words "substantial step"?
the court's admonition was sufficient. but we're   we   we have to respond to the case that's before you.
it's putting something physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that are copied from the master disk and then put into either a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing. it's something that is into the computer that will make the computer operate. you're right, justice ginsburg, that the court of appeals for the federal circuit thought it was bringing this statute up to date and it even said so. we are making an extension of the statute to keep up to date with the technology. that is not for courts to do. this court is  
what you're suggesting is that there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold. it could be the same thing. if it's reproduced outside the united states by some laboratory outside the united states, then the components are not being sent from the united states for reassembly abroad.
  the issue, it seems to me.
i don't believe the court did.
could you point me to places in the record where it supports your position on the use of the visible restraint?
no, but the point  
yes, sir.
  that's what we're  
it's the application of law to fact. what the court decided   this court said, i think in yee  
right.
you disagree with the  
well these, these were declarants who gave a whole declaration. they didn't just say that bottom line.
assuming that defrauding the landlord, justice stevens, involves predicate acts of mail and wire fraud or some other variety  
well, i'm   if it's navigable waters, and you have a huge post that's holding up a bridge, there could be a   there   and it's federally licensed   there could be a discharge resulting from that. i mean, i   that is what a person would say, "there is a discharge," because suddenly you see   where water was naturally flowing, you see a diversion, in an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over. but what we have here is not that case. what we have here is an impoundment. we have the water being diverted into a narrow channel, dropping down onto these turbines, being used, and then being discharged into the river. the word "discharge," again, in 1970, under the 21(b), was given a broad definition. 402 and 404 came later, in 1972, as part of the clean water act. in those, we're dealing with discrete conveyances of pollutants, 402. and 404 was dredge or fill discharge. and those were deemed necessary. but they're consumed in 401. in other words, if you get a 402, if you need a 40-   a 402 application, certification, you also will need a 401. 401 deals with the effects of pollution, the effects of the activity on the environment. i thank your honors very much. and i just want to remind the court that the state very much values the power   the importance of hydropower. we value the   our responsibility, as given to us by congress under the clean water act, to be the primary enforcer of our water quality standards. and the only way we can do that, with respect to federally licensed facilities, is section 401. thank you very much.
if they said they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?
well, we clearly did that with the   with the hiland case. that was   that was clear. but the testimony was uncontested on both sides. both reeder's   reeder testified, "we compete against other dealers every day." and volvo's witness testified  
  an entirely separate   an entirely separate rationale. it was saying the tribe is getting this tremendous advantage by   or wants this tremendous advantage   by marketing the exemption.
but, your honor, those appropriations don't do the trick, and maybe i can just explain our test and explain why. the court in doremus explained why there was standing in everson to challenge the payments for bus transportation by saying everson showed a measurable appropriation or disbursement of school district funds occasioned solely by the activities complained of. in other words, there has to be some   the violation caused some unique expenditure. not that the moneys wouldn't have been expended, because in this context the taxpayer doesn't have to show a lower tax burden, but  
no, no. they're   they're saying it is appropriate. they're saying it is appropriate. we have the people put in the box. the box is are they in a situation that is different from the average murderer. yes. and they're making the determination that although they're in that box, that morally they're no different. morally they're the same  
well, why doesn't it? it seems to me that the only identification of an entity or person, if you want, to be disregarded is the identification of an lea, and the lea is described in terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. so why doesn't that foreclose your position?
it seems to me  
where is it pending?
on the meaning of  
okay. i got the point.
right.
well, what the ninth circuit, in a   in an opinion by then-judge kennedy that we have cited, called simpson   said you respect the plaintiff's allegations. if the plaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is an out-of-state corporation, the plaintiff is the master of the complaint. and, in the simpson case, the ninth circuit held that it was completely proper to remain in federal court, even though it was obvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was an in-state subsidiary that, if it had been sued, would be non-diverse. so, we think that's the proper answer, mr. chief justice. now, if i could turn to the second issue that we have prevented   presented, that concerns how one would treat eqr, which is the management agent of lincoln property company. we read the fourth circuit's opinion as engrafting onto this court's test in the carden case an additional requirement that, in addition to the citizens of  
thank you, mr. himmelfarb. mr. hart.
but   but they're also urging a position. the state at some point should take a position on what the evidence is. at that position   at that point, after urging that mr. wesley is the shooter, they   were they untrue? were they   i mean, the prosecutors at that point maybe then   if they were believing that   that eastman was testifying truthfully, why wouldn't they now believe that he was testifying truthfully now in the motion to vacate?
well, in my case nobody mentions it but the judge.
no, but you've  
may i ask you to comment on this? this problem of   just troubles me a little bit. if we hold this provision unconstitutional because it is not congruent and proportional and so forth, does it not follow that the title ii is entirely unconstitutional, it cannot even be enforced by injunctive relief?
for the same reason laches is never applied against the government.
i do not believe that is possible, and with respect to the argument to that effect that is being advanced by respondent, a close reading of the cases being cited will disclose that they're not, in fact, unique to admiralty. they are common law cases about what the   what the power  
that, the tenth circuit did rely on that document and did not consider any other information as a result of its ruling with respect to that document. the tenth circuit also had before it the awards fee documents which mr. stone provided to the government, and those are at joint appendix 247 to 249. it also had mr. stone's affidavit when he testified in his affidavit as to his meetings with the government, and also had additional affidavits  
yes. the jury did find an aggravating factor beyond  
supposing you did have a contract, such as justice scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer agreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as favorable a concession as any other volvo dealer could get at the same time. if there were such a contract in place, would the evidence show that it was breached?
your honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the first amendment, and certainly it is about this case. and our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. and it's important  
  specific.
thank you, counsel. mr. gray, you have 6 minutes remaining.
no problem.
i thought it was the united states?
what   what is the   can you   this is something i should know, but i don't know. all right. it's very elementary. if you have two parties from different states, diversity claim, they're in court perfectly properly. now, if somebody intervenes under, say   say, rule 24 or suppose it's rule 19, a necessary party, and that destroys the diversity, does the   does the federal court still have jurisdiction? it does, i gather, under rule 14 if the defendant impleads or brings his own lawsuit  
looking at the rule, it does require these findings. has that been interpreted to require that they be written on the record or is that simply something that's supposed to guide the district court?
i think, your honor, they would be different. in each of those cases the laws in question operated to protect a private entity or group of entities. in dean mills, for instance, it was a group of private milk pasteurizers within a five-mile radius of the town   the city of madison. in none of those cases was the government itself engaged in providing the service to the public.
give me an example of the   of the function of 2680(a). when would there be liability, but for that provision?
well, i think it is, but, again, i think  
was   was the latter question ruled upon below?
well, i don't think that's perfectly clear. the "otherwise" language does suggest that you are right. but if the statute instead of saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct that presents a serious risk," which i think is a permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but if it said that, then it is not   you are not taking as a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether or not they do.
it's only   the   the federal question comes up only on issues of preemption. they may or may not be presented in a particular case.
and if   if you prevail here, it seems to me that counsel can come in and say, now, judge, i've looked at your calendar, and you can certainly wait for another 2 weeks, and the judge has to do it.
thank you, mr. goldberg. mr. howe, we'll hear now from you.
but that would be   that would be a disputed issue of fact.
  asked him, have you been convicted in any court of  
is it because the judge could imagine reasons that the prosecutor might have had?
i think the historical context is different, but this was set up in this case by informing the jurors that we were involved in a war, in a war on drugs in society. and then he uses the same story, analogizing jurors' responsibilities to that of soldiers in a war. i think it is also important to put that comment in the context in which it occurred. not only in the broader context and the repeated   the prosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office behind this, but this came right on the heels of him saying, i'm the top law enforcement officer in this county. i decide in which cases we seek the death penalty.
no. it's, "whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force." that's what "knowingly" applies to. and then the words "threaten, corruptly persuade, and engages in misleading conduct," have inherent knowledge in them. in other words  
are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? that's a big plan. you don't need all that. we'll just let you deduct x amount.
post-prosecution. not post-prosecution damage actions but appeals, direct appeals, to invalidate the conviction  
this is not affirmative action, no. it is not invidious, justice scalia. it is simply one consideration of race to control violence in prison, and as the bureau of prisons uses in   in its prisons, they in the united states' brief say that they consider race to maintain racial balance in their prisons for the purpose of diversity. california also considers race in maintaining racial balance in its prisons, not primarily for the purpose of diversity, but for prison safety to make sure that no one group takes over a prison, thus putting members of another group in a vulnerable situation. there are many circumstances when   when race should be  
justice scalia, if he  
yes, i believe it would.
i thought that, that justice powell explicitly said it. i that chief justice rehnquist had explicitly said it. i thought if you went back in sense to the slaughterhouse cases, you'll find in 1872, this court thought that the primary objective, the primary objective of that fourteenth amendment was to take people who had been formerly slaves and to bring them into this society, and that all of phrases of that amendment should be interpreted with that objective in mind. i mean, it didn't say that explicitly there, but it seems explicitly and implicitly this court has said that.
can he do that?
i'm not sure it is, your honor. both of them are going to have definite durational consequences for confinement.
21 of  
  we've been able to  
only in the most threshold sense; because, on its face, the president's proclamation, or determination, is focused only on state courts, and what the president says is that he has determined that the avena decision will have binding effect in state courts. so, according to the executive determination, that does not have a binding effect on this proceeding; but, rather, on a subsequent  
that's correct. this judge stopped complying with the act on november 8th, 1996 because the court ruled that the waiver for all time was valid. that was a   an injudicious finding, to say the least. 5 minutes worth of legal research would have shown that all the courts of appeals at the time had already held that the waivers were invalid. so the court didn't do a balancing, didn't think it was doing a balancing. the court has a colloquy in which it appropriately expressed skepticism about the need for this delay, and the court does, in effect, what congress was concerned about. it indulged defense counsel and said, well, if you don't care enough, i don't care enough. take 3 more months. that's basically what happened.
but  
the   the state does. it is administered by the michigan secretary of state  
that's correct, your honor. you're looking at how   how a reasonable juror would view the case if it knew  
i thought we had left that open. i thought we  
  because he wasn't bringing in at this point the biological   by the way, biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor rather than an aggravating factor?
in your view.
well, that's a good question.
well, they aren't available. this company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service.
and i   i noticed the defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in any way on the   the demeanor of the   of witness 16, which means either the   he   he saw it and said nothing or he   he didn't see it at all. we don't know.
is there any indication that that's in the works, or is this just another conceivable thing?
you agree that it is violated.
uh-huh. yes.
you said we're going to do it on the hypothesis that it's a big country and somewhere out there somebody might do this. if   if two oil companies did it, quick   quick look or per se analysis?
it's a compensation issue.
justice scalia, i don't think that even the state's view would affect this court's doctrine about what happens to the mandate if the court grants cert because they're only talking here about cases in which cert is denied. the denial of cert is not a final decision on the merits, and there are reasons, as we've cited in the brief, for reconsideration sometimes continued after that.
who gave none, your honor?
i'm sorry?
thank you, general long. mr. lange, you have 7 minutes left, and normally i wouldn't intrude on your rebuttal time, but i would like to ask you to comment on one thought. do you think it would be appropriate before a district judge ever grants a stay and   and abeyance procedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly a probable cause determination, but some kind of a determination as to whether or not there is arguable merit to the state claim that he wants to stay the proceedings to   to allow him to exhaust?
yes, sir  
well, i   i will repeat. the   it involves a currently pending legislative issue. it does not talk  
if the epa concludes that regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health and welfare, can it decline to regulate?
if this case were identical, everything's the same, except that the officials involved are state officials, would there be a 1983 action?
what we do have in the record, your honor, is that the policy and the practice does not apply after the 60 days. inmates are allowed to request a cell together and can choose their own cellmates so long as the other cellmate agrees.
very well, mr. kneedler. ms. dahl, we'll hear from you.
  that's cause  
and you're saying that if there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty to protect under the   under due process procedures.
thank you, mr. zelenka. mr. johnson.
i see what you mean.
well, actually we've cited it in our brief only for the article iii proposition which this court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article iii standing because there was an economic energy  
a lot. and there are a lot where the democrat wins. so if your principle is accepted, says the other side, that means that any district that's drawn here to favor the democrats can't be changed, but all the ones that favor the republicans can be changed. now, if that argument is right, it's hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle of constitutional law. so i want to see what   what your response is to that.
well, that's true about the right to remain silent or any other rights that are very much the rights of the defendant, not the rights of the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation with the counsel, and if they make a determination not to contact the consul, then that's a decision that counsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are remedies for that. i'm not sure how it's different than the right to remain silent.
but under justice breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.
which ones?
suppose that a law-school faculty could decide that it does not favor a particular war, and use that as the basis for excluding recruiters, "by allowing this recruiter to come on campus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our students, saying, 'join the army and fight the war that we're now engaged in.'"
thank you very much, mr. stock. mr. shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining.
is this the document that's on 20 the lodging at page 31-34?
your honor, in most cases  
consider too what the facts of record are here. this prosecutor was a complicit conduit in this action. he admitted in the presence of a grand jury witness that he couldn't care less about the guilt or innocence of these people. he just wanted a conviction so he could obtain a lucrative position in private practice. i understand he is still a prosecutor at this time. but that decision of the prosecutor, based upon facts of that kind, has no probative value whatsoever in terms of the independent action that might have broken the chain of causation in a case of this kind. nor does the indictment of the grand jury have any probative value because exculpatory evidence was withheld from the grand jury. and i think in determining the value of the grand jury's action, you have to really determine not only what was presented to the grand jury, but also what was withheld from examination.
well, that's my position justice
but, your honor, it only turned out at the end that, in fact, that was not correct. and these matters snuck in through discovery, in the course of  
those were all the, you know, private attorneys-general-type cases, where you're   where the view is that the plaintiff is carrying out a mission of ferreting out and enforcing the law. but that's   this is a quite different context.
that could be an issue that would have to be litigated in connection with a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust. if the prisoner alleged, and could prove, for example, that he received explicit threats from the prison guard that, if he filed this administrative claim, harm would come to him, i would think that a court could permissibly find that that wasn't an available remedy. but short of   short of explicit threats, i think he would   it would be a more difficult issue  
well  
can you quantify the correlation or lack of correlation for me?
yes, but reves demonstrates that   that your statement earlier that since it was fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business of the corporation is simply false. we   we haven't held that whenever a corporation violates the law, it goes beyond its business, although in a sense it does. in reves, we   we said it didn't.
but then the court is making  
justice scalia  
i believe the text and the historical background suggests otherwise, your honor. article 4 of the treaty says that the kansas lands will be the new homes of the oneidas and it also explains where the oneidas can exercise sovereignty. it says that it will secure to the oneidas in the kansas lands, in said country, which refers to the kansas lands, the right to establish their own form of government, to appoint their own officers and to administer their own laws. that means that sovereignty is to be in kansas, not to be in new york.
in the noncapital context. and it's very   it's very different, because the california state courts are articulating particularly   - particular policy reasons for noncapital prisoners to delay. one that they're articulated is a desire to avoid the piecemeal presentation of claims. and this is particular to california's original writ system. you can have a functional appeal, but, because it's also an original writ, you   if you have an additional claim that's legitimate, you need to add it in that claim.
yes.
justice kennedy, we're not 10 saying that states are powerless, and there are many 11 cases, probably the majority of them, where states do 12 diligently defend their own convictions in cases of this 13 type. unfortunately, the reported cases show that there 14 are many cases where either they're not able to or they're 15 unwilling to because the state sentence has long since 16 been served.
and education would not  
i think the warrant covered   i think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and   and the   i believe the warrant  
you're simply saying that any court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction. we grant you that. but, granted that, if we reach it, what is your answer to the claim that the coa requires a showing of substantial infringement of constitutional, as distinct from other sources of, rights?
yes, justice ginsburg, and in that sense, it's very much like the rule this court laid down in federal cases in massaro where it   it explained just the practical difficulties associated with requiring claims that need, for example, a prejudice record, and everybody believes that a prejudice showing would need to be made before you could establish a violation. but here, we'd have to   we have to go back and we need the tools of post-conviction review to establish prejudice. and here, once we got there   this is   this is not speculation. this is a lawyer made a strategic decision, he says, not to tell his client. and then we tried to raise an ineffective assistance claim, and the court said   in addition to saying it was barred for other reasons, said that doesn't meet strickland. this is that category of treaty violations that, if you push these claims to ineffective assistance, they evaporate, and that does not get  
not at all, because it makes clear that congress didn't mean, here, to criminalize every act of violence that occurs. it has to be, in order to be actionable, a "plan of physical violence to obstruct interstate commerce." that's why this doesn't apply  
your honor, what makes that opinion wrong, based upon the facts that were presented, is the fact that the   there was no warrant achieved in the situation. if the officer is entering under exigent circumstances  
but what about wisconsin, michigan, illinois, and   and florida? maybe they all have different statutes and they have different kinds of causes of action that may be relevant in the retaliation case.
there are several things that are built into the statute. first is 701(b). it has to be an act of the employer, and those trivial matters  
section 402 uses "discharge" in the same sense, i assume.
yes. yes, that is true. and   and, of course, as   as this court has recognized  
not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.
i think that it is, justice ginsburg, to this limited extent. in an ordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by rule 8. and in some sense the rule that the allegations in the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is really derived from rule 8 and its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a shortened claim statement of the relevant underlying facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss. what congress did in the reform act was to require first of all some degree of particularity in allegation; but congress went further than that; and to the extent that congress spoke in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we do believe that congress abrogated the background rule that the allegations must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put it, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's favor. that clearly is a change on the preexisting law; and it is a change with regard to the law that circuits were applying before the enactment of the reform act.
i would say yes, extortion for austin v. keith. there was speech to pressure, and yet this court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the first amendment. i'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.
it would be an easy example. (laughter.)
well, if nothing else   and this guy is squarely within what congress wanted to capture. if nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in this case than that it covers persons like this whose convictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested and could leave for another day   but let's  
even though it was not an adverse job action.
that's correct, your honor.
no. and   and i can   i can tell you, mr. chief justice, i have probably handled 500 causes of action for discrimination cases, and i've never seen anybody plead the issue of whether or not somebody has 15 employees. it's just not done.
assault with intent to murder.
in other words, it gets them off on a detour, distracts their attention from the evidence that is before them.
well, i think you have ruled on this court   point by many times recognizing that even persons against whom the statute or law would not directly affect   for example, all the way back to 1925 with pierce v. society of sisters, there was no legal prohibition against the school. the legal prohibition was against the students not going to public school. so 80 years ago this court recognized that. in a situation analogous to this, the school  
he has no recourse for that check just because he's been doing spy work?
in that respect, how does the   there may not be a definitive authority by this. oregon says that if a corporation commits manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount official the corporation gained by committing the offense  
no, no, justice kennedy, that's not our position. let me   let me try and be clear. we think that any vessel that comes into the internal waters and ports of the united states and offers a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service to our residents is subject to the ada.
do we have  
it came in, yes, mr. chief justice, as to the insanity defense, but could only be considered if eric knew right from wrong. it cannot be considered because of the peculiar adoption of an amendment to 13-502, which is the arizona insanity statute, that eliminated consideration of the nature and quality of his acts.
justice alito and justice breyer and i myself am interested: can you tell us what has happened since the plan's been enjoined?
i think that you really only have to look at   the   the fact that these are present in the court's files and the fact that  
i'm not asking you to rank them. i don't want a list of cases that have a lot of dicta because some of these cases went off on laches, some went off a lot of different grounds than purely   than   some of them don't even mention probate.
with direct shipping, justice scalia, we can personalize things. in terms of the bacchus case, as justice ginsburg pointed out, new york, like hawaii, conceded protectionism. it is very rife in the legislative record in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. in 1995, when governor pataki vetoed a bill that would have solved this problem, he said, and i quote   and this is in the record, the joint   the second circuit joint appendix, at 442   he said, and i quote, "since the vast majority of this country's wines are produced in california, i believe that this bill would inevitably lead to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that state into new york. this increase could, in turn, lead to a decrease in sales for new york liquor stores and their distributors, and shrink new york wineries' market share. that is protectionism." and, finally, the notion that small winemakers could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do this   if you could drive out to middleburg and visit juanita swedenburg's winery   and she invites you to do so   [laughter.]
and it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong? let's say he says   you have special interrogatories to the jury and his allegation has always been the pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the wrong kind of cement. and it turns out it has nothing to do with that at all. the jury says, no, that's not the reason it failed, it failed for another reason. is that a sufficient connection?
may i ask you on that question, if we turn to the statute, to section 201, there's reference to "shall regulate" if in the judgment of the administrator there is a for real danger and so forth. in your view, is there a duty to make a judgment?
i thought the state argued that knowledge   that there's this plan, and they had a common design to rob. is that right? and then the state said that common design plus knowledge that an inherently dangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the felony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment would be reasonably likely to produce death. that's what the state argued was the law of ohio.
well, it does relate to the privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. one of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy to say the police should not barge in like an invading army.
it's the resemblance test, and the question  
of those four, extortion does seem to potentially have the least risk of all those crimes enumerated. but  
well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a). and i think if one is   even leaving aside the question of deference to the secretary for a moment, justice ginsburg, if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general. and if one looks at the two provisions, section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only: that is third party employment. and it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by third-party employers are   or third-party employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption.
i think it absolutely just lasts a reasonable time, justice scalia, and the reason why there is very little law and very little litigation on this is that since the 1917 statute that congress originally wrote to provide for the issuance of federal search warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution period, and that 10-day limit has been contained and continued in the federal rules of criminal procedure. so in the ordinary  
no. of course  
no, but if it was  
first amendment rights. i think that is the case. not cited in our brief. but there are cases to that effect.
they   they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the state zoning systems, there would always be state administrative review before the issue even comes up.
in our brief we   we looked at lee v. weisman in what the court called subtle and indirect coercion to religion when it was merely standing for a   a invocation during graduation once a year. and we contrast that with what's going on here and the constant pressure day after day, if you want this set of benefits, get religion.
in the context of this case  
so you've got more problems.
have you ever seen it in a state? have you ever seen a state which gets a case back from  
my question, of course, is simply this. when you have thousands of school districts relying on this to get a degree of integration in the united states of america, what are you telling this court is going to happen when we start suddenly making   departing from the case? do you want us to overrule it? why? why practically?
let me   let me   let me pause for a second and think about that. the   i think the problem with that   my instinct is that there is a problem with that, and i think the problem with that   not just because, your honor, i represent the state   but i think the problem with that is that it is, in no way, congruent to the constitutional rights. in other words, what it's doing is, it's giving, only to a limited class of prisoners, a particular set of rights. in a way, this is the   this is the underbreadth argument that we made in our brief that the   that the petitioners, in their replies, made fun of a little bit. but, quite honestly, this is   this   it would be giving disabled inmates   making them into a special class for purposes of constitutional violations that don't apply just to disabled inmates at all. quite the  
in your point of view, would it help if the court said   i guess it would, but i   in order to get rid of this problem, if the court said, "look, it says 'reasonable.' of course prison has special problems," and, referring, say, to turner versus safley, said that, "these things about television remote controls are not really, normally, a matter of unreasonableness." so, in other words, we hit   we   you'd give considerable discretion to the   to the warden, and the act would have bite in cases where there is really a serious problem, like this one. it's alleged to be a really serious problem.
but are you saying, in response to the chief justice's question, that, in fact, congress, itself, could not explicitly pass a statute that says, "no state, through its doctors or otherwise, may authorize the use of morphine"  
well, under their theory, though, justice ginsburg, the court could, because of their construction of the removal jurisdiction provision, would retain jurisdiction.
well, i believe  
well, the ground of deportation that refers to "aggravated felony" refers to someone who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. the ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and the enhanced penalties under section 1326 for someone whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for a conviction for an aggravated felony. so, my point is that, under the ina, the consequences turn on conviction, and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction   here, state law   to see whether it   to look at the   to determine the status of the crime. and since state law determines it to be a felony, that's the  
so, you would distinguish   in your answer to justice souter   this is   this is a lawyer. one room in the house is devoted   is his office.
it   it would depend on if they are   what level of gang membership they are. california has a very complex system for what   doing what they call validating gang membership. if they are a validated gang member, generally they are sent to a special prison, and yes, they are housed with members of their own gangs in a very high security setting.
all right. so the trial judge can   can overrule the challenge.
chief justice roberts, the danger in that hypothetical is that we are approaching an area where the definition of the reasonable juror becomes something subjective. the definition of a reasonable juror is not a subjective inquiry. in fact, it's a   it's an objective inquiry. so to that extent, i would have to disagree with   with your analysis or your   or your hypothetical, which is that maybe there might be two jurors out there who would listen to this evidence and vote to convict mr. house. i don't think that's a correct statement  
i think it truly depends on the circumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a more compelling case for stay and abeyance. in mr. rhines situation, he did go to state court first and exhausted the vast majority of the 35 separate claims that he has raised.
no, but i mean in describing the authority of the investigating officer to execute the warrant, does it describe it just in terms of a physical number that can be listened, or one or more numbers, plus a time period, or does   does it say you may listen only when he's talking about foreign affairs or  
  that this program would allow some searches that are   that violate the fourth amendment, but that this particular search would not? how closely can we focus just on what happened here, or do we have to consider all the   all the types of searches and the circumstances of searches that the california program might permit?
it's   no. and   and if there's a settlement in which the state is not involved but the medical bill is compromised   so it's not out there to be recovered   the medical bill  
well, one could have said  
your honor, i  
i understand, and i do appreciate it. i don't think the broader theory, number one, was if i was a target, that's all there is.
but   but that's not the definition of witness that   that crawford adopted. that would be  
okay.
the eleventh circuit found that the jury might conclude it was deadly force.
well, 6(e) i think begins stating that this   these are exceptions to section 5 which is the retention   the general retention provision of the united   for united states lands. but if we look at 6(e) itself, it's  
that's correct.
if they were to do that. but i don't anticipate the state courts adopting that practice, because it would double their work. they would have to make both decisions, merits and untimeliness.
but mr. phillips, you don't look at these things one at a time. you look at them altogether.
why   why is it exactly that a policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a punch? now, the policeman might make a mistake about that. he   he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake. now   now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?
well, what i'd prefer and what the statute means aren't necessarily the same thing, your honor. i'd prefer violent criminals who are dangerous not to have guns. but again, that  
he won some, he lost some, but the  
yes.
well, the exception   this court has told us, in both smith and kosak, that it is the   the lower courts and this court, when they're viewing an exception to the federal tort claims act   that they shouldn't extend the waiver, nor should they view it more narrowly, that they should look at the waiver   they should look at the exception and make a determination as to what the meaning of the words are, and what the reason for the exception was, and they should do no more, nor no less, than that.
so they say that it does not   the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back down the chain of experimentation to embrace the development of new drugs that will be subject to fda approval. in your opinion, is that statement, as i read it   i left out the word "identification"   as i read it, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or incorrect statement?
please do.
yes, well, those cases happen to involve   happen to involve sentences. this case doesn't involve a sentence. it involves an opportunity to have his sentence shortened. and if habeas can be brought for that, we would phrase it differently. we wouldn't say it would have to invalidate the sentence. we would say it would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have shortened his sentence. i grant you we can't use the same language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is properly a habeas action, then we   we can get some language to make it fit.
well, justice kennedy, i   i think it depends, at least in part, on what role that finding played. if those two verdicts each had as an essential component this fact, this person is the shooter and this person is the shooter, so that the verdicts are necessarily inconsistent so that we know the state has actually got someone in jail they're punishing that's innocent, we would concede there may be a substantive due process right of the   against the state because the state at that point  
so that he   his obligation to sell the gas is   arises at the same time as his purchase.
do you think that political corruption in vermont is a serious problem?
but is it reasonable to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side and 50 on the other? in other words, it would seem to me that that's an easy case to say that the state has not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.
i guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes  
right, and i   harbor tug v. barge, which is a later opinion, explains that that test will look at whether the employee's duties take him or her to sea. now, in this case the dredges operate not only   only on the water, but they're out there usually away from shore and are engaged in regular movement over navigable waters. and the workers on that dredge, such as petitioner, are subject to the traditional perils of navigation which include not only collision with ships, but even capsizing. barges such as dredges are particularly susceptible to capsizing because their distance between the deck of the barge and the water, which is known as the freeboard, is low. in this case it was only 5 feet, and they have a high center of gravity because of those derricks or cranes that are holding the bucket ship. and if it's operating in poor weather or for some reason it's overloaded, they can tip over and you have a marine incident or even casualties. and this worker was exposed to the perils of navigation like other traditional seamen. and this court   we think it's pretty telling that the court basically in two decisions has resolved this case. you have already used 1 u.s.c. 3 in the norton case in defining what is a vessel for purposes of the seamen exclusion in the longshore act. and then in the ellis decision, this court has already held that a dredge, including the scows that were accompanying that dredge, were vessels for purposes of 1 u.s.c. 3 and that the workers were seamen and that they were basically called upon to perform the duties, more or less, of ordinary seamen. and every other court that had looked at the issue and passed on it had equally held that dredges were vessels for a variety of maritime purposes. that was seamen's liens, limitation of liability, and   and the overtime   overtime laws in the ellis case.
no, but it thought   it  
but we didn't  
this court   i'm sorry. there's no empirical evidence that i'm aware of about what impact eliminating dr. miles would have on the wal-marts of the world.
it's not a government contract. the government contract is the contract between the party with the government, and that's what we have here and that's what we're seeking to enforce. but i would point out that cases like jackson transit and the central airlines case   the case   the party suing wasn't really suing on the contract even. it was   the case emanated from the contract, and as a result, the court, nonetheless, held it arose under federal   federal law. in this case, the   the case is directly on the contract itself. so it's a much closer connection to the government terms. under the  
  petition the government.
yes, i   i believe it is.
yes, your honor.
for   well  
i'm sorry, your honor?
then what is the protection under the constitution that deals   is it the due process clause?
the successive petition rules, or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to treat the entire attack as one   as one legal theory, as one case. and it seems to me to be in   somewhat intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you want to under rule 15(c).
no, no. our position has been consistent.
the mainstream person, if there's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep it in the   in the cell, would they?
but the motion itself is not there to take it through the opinion of the court?
and   and going to lunch is the conditions of employment.
how many people are there in california? what's the population?
well, i was  
that   that is absolutely right.
and   and what is the government's position on the latter question?
yes. [laughter.]
no?
so was   there's a section of the bankruptcy act   i think it's 160(c) [sic]   that says if it's an unrelated transaction, then   so, it would be a permissive counterclaim if we had ordinary civil proceedings. then there can be a setoff to the extent of the claim that's being made against the bankrupt estate. there can't be any affirmative recovery, as there could be with a permissive   with a compulsory counterclaim. but you're saying that that section is unconstitutional   160(c) [sic]?
but  
is it difficult to apportion the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled intrastate?
well, then whenever you settled a lawsuit, it would be   you'd have to pay capital gains instead of ordinary income.
yes. the   the  
why is that if they just discovered it? i just learned about what happened 30 years ago at this company and it's   i filed right away. there's no laches.
you're not contending that anything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the perils of the sea, are you?
absolutely.
  i don't see   i mean, i see i was not right. you do import drums of tea. and they say, in the treaty, that a preparation is a solution or mixture containing a substance. and it would seem to be a solution or a mixture containing dmt. and the commentary that i thought helped you does concern plants, but you're not importing plants. so, now i'm rather troubled to see if there is any way that this treaty is interpreted in a manner that allows you to win. what is it?
excuse me. do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?
have you looked at all 59, i think  
well, it was his   it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by   by john mcdonald. what   what created your problem is the fact that   that the corporation went bankrupt.
well, in  
mr. joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard.
you could do that by requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each householder just as much trouble then there could be competition and you would have achieved your goal. no?
but your argument assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites are also tributaries.
well, a partnership is identified specifically under the statute as a   as a   as an enterprise   as eligible for an enterprise.
hasn't that already been found in the guilt phase?
your honor, the uncertainty, however, that the debt limitation is a real limitation that serves the purpose of congress in order to have some kind of fiscal responsibility to the territory is what is furthered by the real limitation of having a concrete appraisal full value as a basis for the calculations.
and throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even though you don't change the capacity of the machine. there's a whole brief on that. so you already argued that whole brief, that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.
which one?
your honor, we are very comfortable within the law that this court has set out. we believe that the court has gotten it right.
they don't know how much. now, i have on page 119, which they cite, of the transcript mr. pruden is talking to mr.   dr. blake. would your opinion change, doctor, if the, quote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than incomplete penetration? answer: same difference. question: so your opinion would not change? answer: that is correct.
but certainly under your view, they ought to be. if you funded a web site which was very popular or a chat room, i certainly think it should come within your proscription so that we can't talk about issues during an election.
mr. himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this california statute. this one is in the motor vehicle code, and there's this offense in the penal code called car theft. do you know what the difference between those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge under the penal code as opposed to the vehicle code?
the sixth circuit   and it's not really clear from this opinion, because it's an unpublished opinion, but the sixth circuit appears to have adopted the magistrate judge's finding which is based on respondent's motion to dismiss that jones substantively, for lack of a better word, didn't exhaust all of his claims, so   i'm sorry. i'm not being clear.
well, i mean, it doesn't   it's   it's not a tennis court or an inner court. (laughter.)
even though there's no functional difference in terms of future litigation between that case and this.
that's not the end of it. from what you're saying, i gather that you believe, in that case, once they purchase the land, it becomes tribal.
i do not believe so, your honor. it is an exercise of the power to define the term and i don't think we can take that language "refers to" to be non-exclusive. when the department said referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it was. if we have any doubt about what the department intended, it actually of course reiterated that definition under the interpretive classification. and it again said that the term refers to, is defined as, employment by the household. if we had any doubt  
but the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits. and it is the problem that congress addressed in its legislation. shake downs. it just is less expensive to pay off the suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion, where that conclusion is highly uncertain. and i don't see how your   your solution of inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, i don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any more than the current situation does.
isn't that an exaggeration of how 60(b) works in practice? it isn't that every civil judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions. the district courts have been rather disciplined in handling 60(b) motions. so i think you have exaggerated what 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.
are the students who are attending those schools getting the benefits of attending a school that's racially balanced? and if they're not, why are you not concerned about that, if that's an important objective of your program?
i'm not sure of canadian tax law.
if i understand your honor's  
well, it's a crime ongoing, in progress. so there certainly could be made an argument. now, whether or not there's an exigency, i think that's doubtful because police could secure the scene and secure a warrant and then execute that warrant.
your honor, i would classify that as not a right, it's a remedy. it is a remedy premised on the denial of the fape to the child. and as a result, it is simply a derivative claim for the parents to recover those funds.
your honor, the report says that it is likely that there is a   a connection, but that it cannot unequivocally be established. i think that   if i could use that to go back to the standing question, your honor, which is the fundamental question of whether they've showed not just a connection between greenhouse gas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global climate change, but the particular class of greenhouse gas emissions at issue in this case. six percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, at most. that assumes you put all u.s. vehicles off the road or that they are all zero emission cars. so you're talking about emissions  
so, what if the employer tells the employee to go out and lie? there's no first amendment protection if the employee, instead, tells the truth?
  another crime.
well, they did, but wouldn't you have to prove under your standard not that they would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted anyway? in other words, that's the distinction between the   the normal case and   and the case that we're dealing with here  
do you  
mr. richland  
why should that be?
  it's enough of an incentive that i   that i don't want to go to jail. there's   there's incentives and there's incentives.
doesn't that mean because there is a required health exception? i mean, isn't that what you're saying?
surely the prosecution would go ahead if there were probable cause. no? no? i mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.
if the sentencing court articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the district court to articulate the reasons why the sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an appropriate sentence under 3553(a).
  while the  
well, you'd be suing some federal agency. i mean, it has to be some federal agency that's running that school, and at least for that kind of a school the burden is clearly going to be on the person challenging the agency action.
at any cost? i mean, what if it   you know, yes, i can   i can sell you stuff that will   that will work in high ph soil, but it's going to be three times as effective. do i have to sell it?
  argued below.
your honor, i don't think that it does. in the sense, i think epa made clear in its decisional document that it considered as an alternative matter, that if it, even assuming it did have the authority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise it at this time. and importantly, too, i mean, just to be clear on this, epa has never made an endangerment finding with respect to global climate change. that was true in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different position on authority to regulate. even then the agency's position was clear. even assuming we have the authority, now is not the time to exercise it. so i don't think  
well, he says at first blush, the above arguably rises to the gregory standard. however, the engine that drives the train in this gregory analysis is the confession by jimmy mccaw white. and then he goes on to say that that, of course, can't be introduced because it's hearsay. so it   it seems as though he says that if it is to be believed what jimmy white says, it meets the gregory standard. so i don't quite understand where gay, which is subsequent to   to this case   where gay comes in because it didn't seem to be the standard that the trial court applied.
the fifth amendment is different from the first, but is it different in a relevant way? the just compensation clause does give the government an incentive, if they can avoid having to use eminent domain and tax the public, gives them an incentive to try to squeeze property out of somebody. if it has any incentive effect, it's one that points to the need for a bivens remedy. why is a bivens remedy  
i respectfully disagree, your honor. we're talking about a woman who has   has stated that she has suffered a beating from her husband, that   a beating that may flare up at any time if the officers withdraw, and the officer needs to know what happened so that he can properly address the situation.
what we have  
  and it must have that power to be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction  
justice  
thank you, mr. ayer. mr. phillips, you have another 4 minutes, and i see that will be adjournment time, i will let everyone else know.
pardon?
i don't think it's too much to ask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a federal question. and it solves the problem.
right.
even though there is the possibility that something above the middle term would also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete fact beyond the indictment to justify it. right?
thank you, counsel. mr. ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining.
  don't see how this goes to premeditation, anyway.
  doubt.
that's true i   i think, isn't it? and then the question is, does a state have a right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in equipoise whoever has the burden of proof. put it all on you, whoever had it. that was their final conclusion. i find it is in equipoise. next question: what happens?
well, would that include   if a tax court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?
of saying no.
certainly, it is something that state prosecutors should follow in the sense of what they should say and what they should not say.
isn't  
should that make no difference?
  defer to something  
well, why isn't the thing to do here   i   i see that you are raising a significant question in respect to   at least in my view, in respect to the   an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute. leave the constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera. but why isn't focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do is he goes to the union   i'm just reading from page 6 and 7 of your brief   and he says, i would like you to invoke arbitration? and they might do it. now, if they do it and it comes out a way they don't like, he then   they might file exceptions and they might win. but what you're worried about is if they don't win or if they don't do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action. that's what's worrying you, i take it.
  got it's  
but it doesn't seem to me to be a fair response to say, well, we had other grounds for  
  it lists the   the charter location, where it's established. and until 1994, that would have been synonymous with its principal place of business.
and congress did not  
  language.
but   but that's an   an investigatory   the administrative enforcement scenario.
well, why   why is that the question? if the new policy meets constitutional standards, why does it have to fix something else?
and you think that the constitution provides the president shall be commander in chief, and, therefore, that can't be given away.
i think that is roughly the circumstance that existed in the first seattle case, mr. chief justice. and additionally, i think that you then have to move into the realm of what's constitutionally permissible and can in a constitutionally permissible use of race a school system accommodate other values like choice and neighborhood ties and family connections to the school system.
mr. bergeron, on, one of the points you made on the spending clause argument, i thought, was that if there are lawyers representing the parents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more frivolous cases. if they are not, more frivolous cases are going to be brought. and there's   there's an intuitive appeal to that argument. do we have any   any figures on the comparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer representation and pro se representation under the act?
well, that's just one of the things.
is it a thing?
since 1988 it's a vestigial reminder of what congress wanted to make sure was understood in 1946. even for the strongest, incontestable mark on the same goods, we are still going to always allow uses that are not likely to confuse.
how is there any other possible one? it says there's no jurisdiction in this situation.
no, but  
well, to what  
but the problem  
your honor, i'd have to respectfully disagree with that because we're not talking about a middle range. what we are talking about is an end point. if i can use the booker example, where you have a term of 10 years to life, the court can certainly make a selection within a reasonable range. at some point, as the court increases its sentence beyond a certain point, it will become unreasonable. we don't need to identify specifically what that point is, the guideline range or something close to it. but when you get to the end point, if there's no justification offered whatsoever for a life term  
it shows that on average. it doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is where the   where the shoe pinches.
i understand that to be this case.
i would have thought that was miscarriage.
justice stevens, the truth is most of them   we do. and   and this is not a   and   and look at the way the system operates here. it's not like we   we sent out this notice, got back, and raced off to sell the property with a gotcha in hand. i mean, we   we went through a very protracted process each time trying to get this person to   to show up. i mean, put this into a certain amount of context. and again, you have to deal with the generality of cases rather than this one, but i mean, this is a property that's got a tax lien on it already for unpaid income taxes of   of approximately, i think, about $14,000, and then it has unpaid property taxes, you know, up to the   up to the total amount of $200. and you know, under those circumstances, we let it sit there for years. i mean, there's no question we would be better served if   if they would have shown up and just paid off the taxes. but it seems to me that all goes into the calculation of what's the right answer as a legislative matter, and legislatures have made pretty reasonable adjustments in terms of, you know, how strong is   i mean, i think what arkansas did here. if this is your homestead, we're going to go just as far as you said, justice stevens, to try to make sure we get the information to you.
well, suppose we told the d.c. circuit that the geneva convention or some other body of international law controls, and just remand it for it to go into all these arguments?
  that would be   but that would   that   the   a court would be in a judgment about   in saying that that  
well, that's better than what is in the opinion. what is it? 181.
shell and texaco fixed the price, if it please   if it please your honor. under the brand management  
  what do you make of the fact that there was prior law that required   i forget its exact words, but something like "reasonable procedure," and that language was repealed?
well, the government says  
you can   may answer.
the theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.
so there has to be some indication of the likelihood of escalation into violence?
they ultimately did, your honor, but that consideration of getting a warrant was also at play in matlock and, i think, in rodriguez. and the point is, if one has valid consent, you don't have to get a warrant. they  
no. it can be   in this case, for example, the challenge is that these conferences were   the entire conference program was a program to further religion over non-religion.
mr. jett, there's one piece of this picture that's different   that distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense. if it's self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene. you know exactly what happened. no one taking a picture of these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this. and the judge, when asked to give   to allow the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it than not. now, he thought that the defendant would have the burden of proof. perhaps the judge would call that close question the other way if he thought he was saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of persuasion.
and further, i thought you told me that the petition goes on to indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the official sentence was reversed, looking at 9(b) on joint appendix 35.
well  
well, i think the problem, your honor, is that the presumption does take one view over another based on   based on something that was adopted at the time there was no analysis. the presumption says we're going to presume market power, and as justice scalia said, we're going to put the entire burden of refuting market power, in this one context, separate from all of antitrust analysis, on the defendant. and we're only going to do it in tying. we're not going to do it in exclusive   vertical exclusive dealing arrangements where the product is a tie. in that situation, which theoretically should be exactly the same, there's never been a assumption that there should be a market power presumption when the product that's the subject of the exclusive dealing arrangement is patented. territorial arrangements. there's never been an assertion that that's true. this   this is a relic really of the fact that when the court decided these patent tying cases, there was a hostility to the expansion of   of intellectual property rights beyond the scope of the patent. that first was reflected in patent misuse doctrine, and then it was carried over to antitrust doctrine without any analysis about whether the assertion that the patent was unique, and therefore there were anticompetitive effects, had anything to do with the level of anticompetitive effect that the court required to show an illegal tie.
so then you're only  
to interfere but not necessarily to injure him.
well, you just have to say at the pleading stage what your theory is.
thank you, ms. sullivan. mr. pincus, you have 2-and-a-half minutes remaining.
the habeas   if you're talking about the   the scientific studies  
  why, in all these years, hasn't the department of labor gotten rid of it? [laughter.]
well, there were two questions embedded there. let me see if i can take them in order. the idea that it is a traditional local function, i don't think can support any kind of meaningful test in this case. the court has rejected that very - that very standard in garcia and the tenth amendment cases, and prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional government function in any particular case. the court found that it was in a total line-drawing morass. and so it said we're throwing that out.
of course the  
and i looked   and i find that rule in chapman?
because the more specific provision   what the court had actually done was to stay the mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari. the   the  
no. that is not my position. my position is that the assignment of income doctrine does not apply. those relationships are all governed by existing law and there is a large body of law dealing with those cases and they can be found in a cite that is offered by the petitioner at page 3 of his reply brief. it talks about the literary agents. it talks about the   the management agents.
  breyer's explanation is a correct statement of arizona law, do you still have an argument that your proof should have been accepted, on the first prong?
absolutely not. i'm sorry, justice kennedy, but that's certainly not what i intend to be saying. we recognize that the non-members have first amendment rights. we also recognize that those rights are protected by the hudson procedures which the union uses. the non-members have the absolute right to prevent the use of their funds not only for this kind of electoral speech but for any kind of political ideological speech and other nonchargeable activities with which they disagree simply by sending in a letter.
grandparents  
yes.
there are many more in this case than there were   in these two cases there are many more than there were in congress and in congress there are many more than they were in first stenberg.
mr. friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?
  making up, for ourselves, what's a reasonable time. if california says a year is a reasonable time, that would be the reasonable time at issue, wouldn't it?
the federal statute  
well, your honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of congress is to reach this activity  
mr. bagenstos, on this point, do we have any figures on what   i guess it's the rehabilitation act that applies to the federal prisons   do we have any figures on   you know, on what that has cost in required accommodations?
you know, what about 2244(d)(1)(a) where congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review? your reading of d(2) is that that's what they meant when they said the state application was pending. the state application or the time for seeking review of the state application, and in   just in just a few sections above that they expressly said that shouldn't we read pending in a different, different direction?
well, you were, but you're not.
i mean, you could leave out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, that's not part of the declaration in the sentence. but the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of the violation of the sherman act, doesn't it?
how do you think that would work with the twinkie defense?
  under pickering here?
that's right.
could i   i   i guess i'm not following this. i don't know why, mr. smiland, you   you have not referred to the last sentence of   of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any united states district court in the state in which the land involved is situated. why isn't that what you're relying on?
and that may be   that would have 17 been the case, your honor, had the pennsylvania supreme 18 court not adopted the very interpretation of your honor's 19 concurrence in simmons that kelly adopted. the 20 pennsylvania supreme court three times said simmons means 21 you get a life without parole instruction in pennsylvania 22 when the state puts future dangerousness at issue. the 23 construction that the respondent gives to simmons and that 24 the court of appeals below gave to simmons, specifically 25 that it only applies when the prosecutor argues that the 1 death penalty should be imposed because of future 2 dangerousness, not only is not to be found in justice 3 o'connor's concurrence, but it is not to be found anywhere 4 in the pennsylvania supreme court's opinion in this case.
yes, your honor. and in subsequent cases   and, in fact, in dole itself   this court pointed out that all bets are off when there is a superseding constitutional right. here, we're talking about the bill of rights and the first amendment. i mean, rosenberger and rust  
are there appeals from the circuit court of cook county?
that's the way the eighth amendment has been interpreted in its application of cruel and unusual  
your honor, what i am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech  
  and you can, too. so you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?
well, they didn't say you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.
why should this be elevated to a special status beyond that?
with respect, i disagree with the characterization, because   well, there are three reasons why petitioners proposed per se rule, which would be unwise. and it is they who are asking for a per se exclusion where the court has not previously adopted a per se exclusion. and the reason why it's unwise is that it will chill speech of paramount public importance by prosecutors and many other public employees. it will force many public employees to go public if they want any chance of constitutional protection, and it will lead to arbitrary and unworkable linedrawing regarding whether an employee's speech falls  
thank you, ms. higgins. mr. castanias, you have 9 minutes remaining.
no, we   if he stays in the united states, he's   and is  
well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy. but the statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do, we'll get into the situation that justice breyer described. everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless.
but don't   how can we, if we have   if   if i read this   this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could i do anything other than say, go to the court of claims, you're in the wrong court?
well, maryland's position is that if you look at the analysis in elstad and seibert, where what this court said is, you don't look at whether something caused something else, you look at whether there was a cure in the sense that the suspect understood his rights  
but one of the problems, i thought, for the indigent is the rulings   am i correct   in michigan, that they're not required   say, there's an objection. there's no written record that the indigent could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to   to determine what issues might be raised on   on appeal.
before you get into the substance let's   let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other secretary's own bill. was the secretary who proposed the   the '94 legislation, the same secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?
thank you. mr. joseffer.
chief justice, it's not under 106(b) or 106(c), because the waiver of sovereign immunity   106(a) provides that, with respect to preference claims  
it was one of the purposes.
i have the same problem. it's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of. i mean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes. i mean, all of these things enable him to get into the country. i just don't understand the basis for the rule.
thank you, mr. hungar.
thank you, mr. nager. mr. minear, we'll hear from you.
well, unless  
and if   if they decided to pursue a bivens claims   a bivens claim, doesn't the   the government often undertake the representation of the government employees in those cases?
no.
what?
yes.
you begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position. they knew how to do it under the   i assume you're referring to the education finance and incentive grant program?
  i had misunderstood something. there's going to be a new sentencing, but there also is going to be a new trial, is there, on the merits?
it might depend on whether there was consideration beyond the patent itself. in the   in this   in this case, though, the petitioner claims that if the   if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe licensing fees, and, under lear, they would be entitled to the licensing fees, that they've paid since they began challenging, back. so, it's clear that under either the contract or a question of  
i don't think   well, i would have to take a very deep breath before i told the court that it was not open to the court to reconsider just about anything that touched on it. i think it would be  
the ninth circuit has jurisdiction this whole time. but the day that it issues its decision dismissing this case, then it is retroactive back to the date that congress passed the statute? that's what you seem to be saying.
i don't understand that. in other words, the fact that it's not the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden? in other words, under justice kennedy's hypothetical  
is it a tiny minority  
thank you, mr. phillips. mr. garre.
but in this particular context which the ninth circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an inelastic market like this one raising input prices is not going to increase supply and  
the case also held that because of the passage of time and the reliance interests that have developed, we are not going to give you possession. now, why doesn't the same principle apply to giving you jurisdiction? because of the passage of time, you can get damages for trespass. maybe even you can get the value of the land. but it would just create a chaotic situation if we say that you have jurisdiction in the middle of new york state over any pieces of land that you can buy.
that's correct.
mr. verrilli, i hope you won't waste a lot of your time on this point. this court is certainly not going to decide this case on the basis of stare decisis, you know, whatever else is true.
  on account of the defendant.
less than 40? and does the record tell us how long they have been in level 2?
do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?
well, i don't think that would be an odd regime. i think if, for example, oregon made a radically different judgment and said that in oregon it was going to be permissible to have treatment or detoxification programs that involve the administration of radically larger quantities of controlled substances than had been recognized in any other state, i think, under the authority of cases like moore, the attorney general can make a judgment   now, that's not a legitimate medical purpose, that's  
i   i think that would be a sensible rule. and in this case, as   as we indicated, not only are the police reports unambiguous, but there's a very strong reason to believe that they were the basis for the guilty plea as it was obtained on that day.
in any case, you   you, you are not driven to the alternative that justice breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity. it's very easy. it was what the dissenters in the booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. it is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about. but it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. there certainly is.
how could the ninth circuit here simply have ignored that criticism of exactly what they did here?
that's the sort of aggressive sort of thing that the colorado courts could conclusively decide.
we're talking about what the law should be. would you make, be making the same argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions of the federal circuit, the ones that they issued within the year, and each as i remember they held that the patent was obvious and therefore invalid? suppose we were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were they, kahn, alpha, and diestar?
right.
they go to different things, don't they? i mean, if you   you get a new trial when there are   you know, evidence is admitted that shouldn't have been admitted, or something like that. i mean, they're   they're, sort of, different grounds. they're not overlapping, are they?
6 was different in that he was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and that made him quite different from juror 16.
yes, but the court didn't make it   the court's proposition in kansas city title & trust was if it appears from the complaint that the right to relief depends on the construction or application of the constitution or laws of the united states. so are you asking us to take out or laws as dictum, or what is your position?
so he has no particular interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or not.
requirements for labeling or packaging  
does this action have to be brought in federal court? it says any court of competent jurisdiction. could  
then why don't we just send you back to do that?
the case is submitted.
and   [laughter.]
pardon me? but you   and you could say that there wouldn't have been any accident with the truck if the truck hadn't been delivering mail.
right.
  where the court has still ultimately got to decide it? what sorts of things could the court consider when it ultimately decides?
for narcotics, not for bombs, not for   just   just for narcotics. the police think, you know, a lot of narcotics goes on interstate buses. we're going to put a dog in the bus depot.
it's different, but that's not what happened. it's different if they've taken   if they've taken the position  
but if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?
this court   this court thought otherwise in   in zadvydas 3 years ago where it drew a distinction. it said the distinction between someone who has never entered the country and someone who has effected an entry  
i think the answer is it clearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation is that there is discrimination today merely because there was discrimination yesterday. whether or not there is discrimination going on during the charge filing period, whether or not women are intentionally being treated differently than men, i think the answer, based upon your hypothetical, is no, given what you've said.
your honor, actually there's another state, oklahoma, which has a very similar policy that says that  
that's correct, your honor.
but this is going to be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have the final say in most of these cases just because we decide so few.
is that right?
i have to disagree, justice souter, because the blueprint   the patent is not the actual series of commands that runs the machine and neither is the blueprint. the blueprint is instructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in intangible code, but it's instructions about how to make something and once it's made it's done. you can say, as mr. olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing that is made. the blueprint for a semiconductor chip in some sense is always reflected in that chip. but if you don't like the chip you have to get rid of it. software can be   if you don't like microsoft word, you can download it and you can delete it and download wordperfect and use that. and what happens in the computer   and i think this does bear on what the nature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense of the word "component" and the ordinary sense of the words "supply" and "combine," they apply naturally to what microsoft does. i mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a screen, is a hard drive, is a cpu a component? are they components when they have the code embedded in it? of course. but that doesn't   a tire doesn't become not a component of a car just because a tire with a wheel attached to it is also a component. the question is  
mr. landau, maybe this   this is a point your   the respondent makes. prima paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. so the answer to everything you said could be, fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the southern district of florida, but it's in a state court. and prima paint just spoke about procedure in federal court.
for your first answer, are you relying what the federal circuit said in its opinion   and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix   that is, the federal circuit's statement of the question presented, whether the preclinical research conducted under scripps-merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of integra's patents.
your honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. and it cannot be, your honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions  
except the criterion is not mere in-state activity. the criterion is a particular in-state activity, an investment, as to which the credit is a quid pro quo. and the opportunity to make that investment is open to every business, presently in-state, presently out-of-state, no matter where domiciled.
thank you, counsel.
well, all that it adds is an analytical framework. it's an elaboration. the word "obvious"  
  than less. that's exactly where we think  
you object to 13. you said it should use the word in whole or in part. official
thank you, ms. forsman. general chanos, you have two minutes remaining.
but do you take the position that juries can do what a state regulation cannot do, or are they much   are they on a par?
you don't know the answer to that.
in none of these cases, and  
well, i   i don't want to say that there's no probable cause for the warrant.
that's absolutely correct, and that's certainly the way that we think it would   it would, more preferably, operate under the statute. but the question before the court in this case is, who bears the burden of persuasion? that's a very important question under the act. it's not just, with respect, an academic question about the number of cases in with   in which the evidence is mathematically in equipoise. it is going not have a much broader impact on the implementation of this statute, because it's going to be decisive, or at least potentially decisive, in cases like this, where you've got a battle of the experts. i think  
  that is, the retroactivity?
i   i asked you  
and is it just an evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the waiver question?
excuse me?
i thought that was just to decide in   in the   in the court of first instance   that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due. but the district court was deciding a question of law, that is, whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.
exactly. that would be precisely how it operates.
it wouldn't be harmless under your theory because your theory is that this is giving expression to your personal autonomy. it's not simply for your defense. if it were harmless, it would say that it's totally wrapped up in the defense. but there's another constitutional interest under your theory.
  tries to make those distinctions.
yes.
it's very hard  
that was a decision made by equilon. equilon would purchase petroleum on the open market. it could purchase it from shell. it could purchase it from texaco. it could purchase it from british petroleum. and it   the   the petroleum products are bought on the open market in arm's length transactions, sent to the refineries, and then the managers of equilon or motiva would make the decision as to which petroleum products to make out of that crude. what's important to remember here is that sherman act doesn't apply to any agreement. under this court's decision in copperweld, it applies to decisions between independent actors, that section 1 applies to concerted activity, not to unilateral activity, so that in copperweld, a parent could not enter into a conspiracy with its wholly owned subsidiary. in copperweld, the court   the court points out that the officers of a company may enter into agreements with each other, but they don't enter into agreements covered by section 1. they're agreements within a single entity. and what we have here is the same thing that the court was talking about in copperweld in getting to its decision in copperweld, is you have a agreement of shell and texaco, which is plainly subject to section 1, to create this joint venture and can be challenged on a rule of reason analysis. but once they have that agreement, you now have the directors of a single entity determining what the prices of its products will be, and that is not subject to further section 1 scrutiny.
i think the disclaimer would make it a harder case, but i think when you're dealing with the ground in a texas state capitol and the texas supreme court, that placement, when you're dealing with the ten commandments, sacred texts, i still think that the message the reasonable observer would be that this is the government endorsing religion.
because in a scenario where the jury has been properly instructed and has returned a complete verdict  
why would it be more difficult?
well, earlier, the suggestion was made, "what happens if the government"   i thought the suggestion was, "what if the government outsources mine inspections? what if, instead of"  
children under ten.
counsel, sometimes these joint statements are actually voted on by the congress as a whole. was this one   was this one voted on?
well, knowledge is a necessary condition, but it's not a sufficient condition, justice ginsburg. in evans, the employer knew it previously had a sexual   a gender-based discriminatory policy about whether or not female flight attendants could work after they got married. but that prior knowledge of prior discrimination by the employer wasn't sufficient to make the neutral action taken  
well, if they had already made the decision to stay home, then they would not be voting for the candidate, but they would also not be voting in another party's primary.
okay.
that's it. okay. we're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?
well, that may be but that also 21 may be what it says. i   i don't follow your 22 interpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting 23 the claim or claims. i mean, once you say that the facts 24 supporting the claim is the vacatur of the   of the state 25 conviction, i mean, it seems that's the end of it.
thank you. mr. dabney, you have three minutes remaining but you may take four.
please, please. i didn't mean to interrupt you. did you finish your answer?
but the point that   i think that they were making is that there will be an investigation, on the spot, ordinarily, in the case of a vehicle collision. post office won't even know about the slip-and-fall until a claim is filed, which could be weeks and weeks later.
why was that rejection wrong? because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction. is it conceivable that when congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, i mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations official say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else. i mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing.
yes, they are, because they're buying   the reason why these people have   under the second circuit's standard, which we think is correct, is that you had to have bought the stock before the fraud, and you were holding it throughout that period of fraud; and so, your purchase is not "in connection with" the fraud, the misrepresentation. but somebody who sees the prospectus, who sees what mr. blodget was saying, which was that there were stocks that were, quote, "a piece of crap," but they were giving them the highest buy recommendation   those people are making their purchase "in connection with"  
  i'm not here, necessarily, as an advocate for overturning morton salt, for obvious reasons. i think the answer to your question is, under morton salt we clearly win, because we   we probably didn't need to show as much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular discrimination on our ability to compete in the future. i think we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of the substantial   or reasonable possibility of injury in the first instance. but, beyond that, i   you know, you could certainly hold, in this case, that reeder-simco has made more than enough of a case in order to recover under the robinson-patman act. but  
that would have been a concern, justice ginsburg, except that issue was brought up expressly before the chinese court; and if i may refer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the chinese court ruled that, quote, "given that the people's republic of china and the u.s. are different sovereignties with different jurisdictions, whether the appellant has taken actions at any u.s. court in respect of this case will have no effect on the exercise by a chinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said case."
i have   forgive me. i haven't seen a judicial opinion that says at the 33 and one-third percentage of probability, i've got to give it to the jury, because that jury might file for my  
well, we think the court of appeals took it claim by claim and read the affidavit   or at least the district court did  
that's bad, too. and i think it's just another thing to consider.
well, if the  
  that you're  
that would apply new penalties to the reentry. this law does not apply any new penalties to the reentry, it just   it just establishes a new regime for removing the person who has reentered.
what does title x of the united states code deal with?
  not that the same matter.
well, justice scalia, in the   in the realm that we're talking about here, the fourth circuit's decision in the friedman's case came to a mootness conclusion. we've also cited in our brief   and i don't recall the names of them off the top of my head   two cases in which the court either   either dismissed or remanded for consideration of mootness in light of another state court judgment. so i think there is   there is a body of law, but i also know that it is   as recently as yesterday looking at wright and miller on this issue, that when complete relief has been accorded by another tribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.
  pose an undue burden. and i was just following up to say that so, in some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden.
it had nothing to do with  
see, one of the   one of the things that concerns me about this case   unlike zant, most of the cases in which we have found the label of aggravating   immaterial   or findings like prior criminal histories   robbery, or something like   but whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found, we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit on the   on the   in favor of death. clemons and the other were cases of this kind of aggravating  
mr. fisher, i realize you don't concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that the failure to pay the full rate is   could be considered a practice here. but let's assume for the sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning of the text. if the   if the agency had explicitly said, what we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of, what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to official the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the statute, would your position be the same?
yes, your honor. and, of course, in california like elsewhere, peremptories are used sometimes to remedy a failure to properly grant a challenge for cause. your honors, california's system maintains a proper balance between protection interests and the state's and parties' interests in using a venerable tool for selecting a fair and unbiased juror.
if there's no cause of action, there's nothing to   to claim on, what's   what's the closest analogy? is it like a promise to make a gift, which is unenforceable? is there kind of a contract analogy that we can use?
and the question under the district court's opinion is whether the political motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise be a violation of section 2. is that correct?
what do you rely on? i just don't know where we look for the  
but i take it if you win this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person who has total immunity.
  routine, was  
on collateral consequences, do you have   what is your best authority to say that in   it would keep this case from being moot? official
well, i respectfully disagree. in   because, in fact, we didn't really argue, in the oregon supreme court, that we were entitled, necessarily, under the eighth amendment. our argument was primarily under the statute, that this statute says any evidence which came in should be admitted in the retrial.
but that is certainly a possibility. and i do not want to exclude the ability of a supervisor to fire somebody, if that possibility exists, without having to go through extensive litigation.
yes. it says  
he is to give due   the due regard provision we think is essentially precatory, as the   as the seventh circuit said. it reminds the   the tax court judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility determinations. but again, that's not what happened here.
justice scalia, i think it's a little different only because in calderon it was only an inherent power question, and this court read the exercise of that inherent power in light of aedpa. this case involves a rule of general application that authorizes a practice. and the   the proper standard of review for   for that practice is the abuse of discretion standard.
well, they certainly hadn't said it in the fall of 2001, your honor. and so, for that reason  
no, your honor, because this court has said, in any instance, federal courts have equitable power unless congress has expressly stripped it of that power. united states versus umansky would be an example where this court said that, as well as the language from franklin versus gwinnett county. and that's especially true here, where congress, in the rico statute, specifically said that it should be broadly construed. this court, in sedima versus imrex, said especially as to the remedial provision, section 1964, this should be broad construction.
and what do we look at to determine that? i know what we said in de grandy, but i mean how   i mean, you talk about the south and west texas. i mean, on the other hand, 23 and 25 are actually not that close together. so how do we know that we should be looking at all the way from el paso to the gulf, as opposed to a narrower area?
okay. then what kinds of things would you  
  of the sentence.
no, but   but the refusal to answer   i just   you know, it happened so long ago, your honor. i had a lot of other   i   you know. but it comes up later, and he says i just don't remember why i challenged this  
  can't be a complaint.
  don't apply this  
well, your honor, those cases would not arise under the idea  
  and the judge was obliged to give it. so why   in view of what justice souter just said about simple murder requiring a deliberate design, where was the deliberate design here?
well, your honor, i would refer back to black at 1255, which is the important part.
well, they say you cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are charged as such, and that the documents show he was charged as a principal.
if we could go back to the first question that the chief asked you, you said yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain line between the d&x and the d&e. is there a way that congress could have written the statute that would have insulated the physician who's performing a d&e?
how does it compare with the system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975 until 2000?
first of all, there is always the possibility, depending on the nature of the grievance, that the prison may address it. for instance, if the complaint is a failure-to-protect claim, and the prisoner is being harmed by being placed with another prisoner, who is   who's dangerous to him, if the state gets that complaint late, they may   they may very well still want to act on it and ameliorate that situation, and that's the kind of thing that could, in the end, satisfy the prisoner and have him not sue. but the other thing is, even if the state   assuming the state doesn't address it, the prisoner, again, has to not just file that; there is an appeals process that normally he'll have to go through, although, in this case, the california   the   excuse me   the prison appeals coordinator just said, "i'm not even going to file it, so you can't appeal." normally, though, you would think you would be able to appeal. he'll have to go through the entire system. at best, for him, he's delayed a long time. and the way congress approached this was to   by provisions like for costs and fees and so forth   was to attempt to dissuade prisoners from filing. this, at a minimum, is going to help to dissuade him from filing, coupled with the fact that, because he is not getting to court faster, he doesn't have what, before the plra, would have been the main incentive to bypass a system that otherwise isn't going to hurt him.
thank you, mr. ainsa. the case is submitted.
  unless the eighth amendment  
no, justice ginsburg, and i'm glad 9 you brought this up because i'd like to point the court to 10 ja1069 and 1079 which is where dr. cooke testifies, as 11 justice scalia anticipated, that he was, in fact, asked to 12   asked to look at the mitigation evidence, and he did 13 look at mitigation evidence. dr. sadoff has the same 14 testimony  
but isn't   isn't the plus simply more than one act?
  in   in drawing the lines at that time. how can we in principle say that the motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?
your honor, there's a difference between refusing to abide by a universally applicable regulation of conduct, on the one hand, and the solomon on   amendment, on the other hand, which is refusing to assist the dissemination of a message. recruiting is all about speech. yes  
a pl-110 resettlee allowed the cia and the fbi to bring in up to 100 people per year that were deemed essential to the u.s. they could have been simply very important scientists who wished to defect.
why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions? why  
that's correct, your honor.
i think that you do have that here, and you should judge it under the pike valency test, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's  
i believe the eleventh circuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.
what about just the former without the latter? i thought the former alone would be enough.
  had a  
yes, your honor, and then they   - they rely on that duty to say that there is an obligation, in the next paragraph, and to distinguishing essingler and say, "we don't have to go through this discretionary analysis, because there's an obligation." and so, our position is that even  
  the necessity for  
well, it's only superfluous under your reading. if it covers, for example, putting the package   negligently placing the package in a location where it's going to cause injury, well, then it's not superfluous.
well, that is our view. again, i think that would be an issue that would be litigated and i'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds of cases that are being filed under this provision. and i think it's   one of the concerns i think of the agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the regulation are to be reconciled and applied.
  tell us what those   what that material is, and if we find that material sustains your burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you lose. i don't know why we have to let you go back and   [laughter.]
  the problem? so, they're saying, as i thought was true since 1920, that you're going to get your dam only if you comply with state standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk in the water, all kinds of things that might be put there by the dam.
try utah, try iowa. try  
could this lawyer have brought the ftca act complaint and pled in the alternative the bivens claim?
  superfluous.
well, that is a government interest, for sure. all government interests  
yes, we do believe that, your honor.
well, justice kennedy, i believe that there is a very meaningful difference between this court's standards of an endorsement and what a state or the nation may do with regard to commemoration. as an easy example, on the national mall, there is, of course, the lincoln memorial and in the lincoln memorial, there is text from the king james version of the bible. the nation commemorates and acknowledges lincoln and what he has said. but by that display, the united states is not trying to endorse the king james version of the bible or a particular religious message in that. instead what the state
that's right. if there's no appellate court jurisdiction, the court doesn't have to go on to construe the scope of the judgment bar. but  
well, but just  
the jury convicted on all three.
it gives some, but it's only bare bones, justice breyer.
no, your honor. it   it says that the court has decide the matter within 30 days or the clock will start running. now, the court, in a particularly difficult or novel question, could   could enter an order of ends of justice exclusion and exclude perhaps an additional period of time.
i'm not aware of any. in the lower courts, microsoft was arguing that the biotech industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious differences between what is supplied in terms of object code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of nucleotides. but i think we need to be quite precise here. we are not complaining that the component is an idea. we're not complaining   we're not arguing that a component is some form of information. what we're saying here is   i mean, nobody is paying billions of dollars from an idea. when the commands are loaded onto the hard drive of a computer in the form of electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button saying give me netmeeting, and the processor says   and this is what electrical engineers say   fetch the instructions, fetch the commands to the random access memory where it's   where it is there reflected in a   in a form of patterns of electrical charges. and when the code then moves back and forth, the instructions move back and forth from the cpu and ram, they   they   millions of times a second they are replicating themselves.
am i missing something?
yes.
well, this court said that donning and doffing was a principal activity in contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary activity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the court specifically said, in steiner, that that holding does not apply to matters that are specifically excluded under section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, justice scalia.
of course. i think  
yes, but did you object to the instructions in the trial court?
have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?
i concede that   it's hard to answer that, justice kennedy, because a habeas proceeding is not a train accident. and there is  
well, in the case of california, there's over 165,000 inmates. in mr. johnson's case, his records probably are many, many banker's boxes full of records. so that's the type of  
that's right, because "corruptly" is, and always has been, a scienter term, and its appearance in section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant from the fact that that word appears in section 1503. when congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to believe, because it intended to do this, that the definition of "corruptly," that had been fairly widespread in the use of the word in section 1503, would be applied to 1512.
no, but you say he's   he's not denied all choice. he is denied the choice that he wants to make.
well, but he said other things too, and one thing he said is, i don't like business method patents very much, and so i'm not going to give an injunction here.
you   you really think that when there is a state provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?
and it's also not disputed now that these were goods of like grade and quality.
mr.  
yes.
how many are there that allow shipment from out-of-state wineries?
well, it   it   if the words, join necessary, limit any suit and the language that justice scalia referred to, then   then maybe we're in trouble. but otherwise  
it is, mr. chief justice, in the sense that it's information that's needed to respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the individual decided to come back and finish what he'd started. and if a law enforcement authority set up its 911 calls so as not to gather adequate information and this individual had come back and actually beaten or killed the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an inadequate response to the emergency situation of an ongoing violent attack. and so for that reason, the rule that we're describing here for the court would deal with not only the present emergency but also its imminent, threatened recurrence.
as was my understanding.
that's right.
right.
by the way, in texas if you have to go through all this probate stuff and everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that precluded to bring that tort action when the person who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about it?
well, that's the  
that isn't reasonable? why isn't it reasonable?
that's a  
  recommend  
and it files the claim directly with the bankruptcy.
this court has held that race may not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and here race was used most gratuitously and cynically to make sure that the state could say a majority of latinos in district 23 support congressman bonilla. the chief redistricter in the house, representative phil king, testified   and this is expressed motivation   that they sought to maintain a 50 percent latino voting age majority in the district while making it safer for congressman bonilla, which involved pulling 100,000 latinos out. similarly  
and we identify their per-pupil revenues, too, don't we? agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below, right?
a new trial on damages   that's all you asked for   not a new trial on liability.
  did he use a controlled substance?
i didn't think we did. and it would seem to me that especially when you have the taxpayer's name and address on file, i doubt whether it would be a denial of due process to send notice by regular mail to that address. and if   if that satisfies due process, the state would never have known that it did not reach the individual.
you can still argue   what hearsay exception did it come in under?
that   that little   even if it's done by the court. i like the way you slipped that in. i mean, even if you had a general rule that you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census, surely there ought to be an exception unless   which   which would read, unless the districting you're living under was never decreed by the legislature, but was decreed by a court. and that was the situation here. surely, that's a good reason, even if you adopted your general proposition.
well, but your position is they don't have to do anything.
i think that's  
ms.   ms. karlan, if this is indeed serious, are you sure that it's not a personnel action?
in 1969? yes, we did, your honor.
but what i don't   there is a body of law on the other side of that issue, too, isn't there?
  the states where most of the hearings have taken place and have taken the opposite view, has  
and not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.
no.
  not required to be kept confidential.
the interest we're talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. it is 10 seconds that the officers should have waited additionally, according to the   to your brother.
yes, in segura, you can retroactively validate it by   by getting a warrant afterwards. could it be   have been retroactively validated by knocking and announcing afterwards? i'm   i'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to the door and they knock and announce and wait   wait 10 seconds.
but i   what i'm saying is that she's not a witness during the emergency period itself.
but it was not obvious to the person who at least drafted the webb-kenyon in the first instance, because as i   as i understand it, there was an anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped. and do we know why it was dropped?
what about the opening of this court's session today, in a manner that has been used since john marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in god.
  and what i'm not facing, in the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your interpretation now, would be, congress passes a law, which becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is   to do is to get the cases in the class actions   not all the cases   but the class actions in the federal court. and then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where we've kept this action out of federal court, there's going to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff, in a state court.
  surprised, in a case involving a ferc license condition, that no one from ferc signed on to your brief.
would you speak up just a little, please?
but here, there  
right.
that's right, justice breyer, but  
the except   it is different   the exception applies whether we do it negligently or nonnegligently. and so, the fact that we didn't happen to do it, at least allegedly, negligently in this case isn't what   can't be what triggers the exception. and what is different is, you   understanding, as a practical matter, what the postal carriers are supposed to do millions of times every day when the mail doesn't fit  
but you would not have conceded. if you   if you thought there was a reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that there was a violation, would you?
you are absolutely correct. as i started to say earlier, they made that choice and they came to michigan, and they obtained a certificate of authority from the michigan corporations division as a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the state.
so that if the statute governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a official second and successive requirement comparable to the aedpa requirement, the case that justice scalia put would be exactly like this case?
yes. in that particular case, gang membership is not a surrogate for race. in the california policy, race is a surrogate for gang membership.
would you describe your state as a clean state politically or as a corrupt one?
your honor, there is no analogous case, because  
well, we certainly would agree with that, your honor, that  
yes, they can, justice o'connor. i think they would be, in fairness   i want to be clear   i think there might be a line where there would be   the recruitment office could conduct itself in a way that would effectively deny access. but i think, with that caveat, there is  
well   explain that.
  let's say they pass this   and it's "unusual"? i mean, we're going to get several categorizations and shadings of statutes. i don't have an answer. i'm not suggesting a point of view on this. i'm curious what you think.
  there's a lot of language  
insofar as it seeks to serve a purpose of the statute to regulate this.
he pays  
what they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party. and that is not what happened here.
  that it  
and it tolled the statute while the "properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review is pending." so the question is during the 90 days after they said no to you in the state court and you had a chance to file the writ, is that application pending? and you say yes, that application is pending, that application is pending and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a petition for certiorari.
it would be a harder case, but i don't think it would be an adequate remedy. and the reason is the city cannot put a religious symbol standing alone on government property just through disclaimer. that's exactly what county of allegheny was. there the nativity scene in the courthouse had a plaque saying it was donated by others, but that can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put the large latin cross just with a disclaimer.
and that is a term of art that's different from circumstances.
after the improvement, there could be drainage. ironically the respondent in this case actually recommends that the barriers between this site and the ditch be removed.
well, it seems to me  
thank you, mr. blanchard. mr. long?
ms. millett, you've been trying to tell us the difficulties that the state would have in bringing suit later.
or was it really applied just in the context of the graham evidence?
if the employee was acting within the scope of the employment when she wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her hand at all.
this almost invariably occurs in every strickland case. and my fundamental submission here is that a defendant who is saddled with a lawyer who performs in an unprofessionally incompetent manner cannot overturn his conviction without  
yes, sir, but it doesn't impact the guilt phase, and that was what the problem was, i believe, in beck, was that   that a jury might not   they don't want to turn him loose because   and they give him a conviction, which automatically carries the death penalty. and that impacts the jury. and i understand that. that was a proper decision, but that just didn't happen here in this particular case. and mississippi has just distinguished beck. i don't believe that they properly raise this court's jurisdiction. they never cite beck. they never raised   they never said due process.
would california allow you to intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?
if that was an external process, but we agree it should be internal to the cia, that the process for applying that standard must remain internal to the cia. the does share the interest in protecting their identity and the identities of others like them. we   we believe that the government  
that's what   that's what voir dire is all about, and the defense counsel did it in many occasions  
now, that  
  if, in fact, there were consistently only in this remote sense so that the interests which are meant to be protected in the   in the opm blue cross contract aren't being protected at the next level, then opm could bring an action against   against blue cross saying it's not consistent enough, couldn't it?
  drug application.
well, with regard to both purpose and effect in this particular setting, i don't think that religion was the driving force. i know that all of the evidence shows that religion was not a driving force in any respect.
  above the dam, and they all   they get killed going through the dam, and they were dead when they  
well, that may or  
  at the end of the day  
i was  
the   the burden of   the presumption of innocence, though, only applies to the essential elements of the crime under this court's decision in in re winship, et cetera, and not   it doesn't apply to affirmative defenses, as the court has consistently held in martin and in patterson and in leland. that is, the   it can be constitutionally   you can put the burden of proof on the defendant to prove an affirmative defense, and the constitution has nothing to say about that. the presumption of innocence goes to all the things   the essential elements of the crime. and here, petitioner benefited from the presumption of innocence. the government had to prove that she filled out those forms, that she filled them out with falsities, and that she knew she was lying when she filled out that   those forms. it had to prove that she received those guns and that she knew that it was unlawful for her to receive those guns. and it had to prove all of those things beyond a reasonable doubt. now, on the position of the states, a significant number of states are on  
it doesn't matter whether it redecided it. it   it was the postulate of   of its   necessary postulate of   of its decision in this case, it seems to me.
for the second display, yes, your honor, there was.
why didn't these lawyers instead of   instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to   to these defendants through the state courts?
well, i think, technically, justice scalia, they probably have a claim for patent infringement, to which the defense, as justice ginsburg  
your honor, his intent was to end the pursuit, not to cause an accident.
  by his cell, which is always opened, and checking in on him to see what's   what he's doing.
well, but that's the  
and it involves continuing, ongoing  
no, your honor, we agree that when congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms "used fairly" to refer to the common law, which included not only the common law of technical trademark, but the common law of unfair competition.
and that's the  
what  
and yours is both pre- and post-   that is, you're referring to conduct that took place before this crime was committed   that is, his prior incarceration   and asking the jury to project that forward to say, "that's how he behaved in prison, before he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's likely to behave again."
well, the government   it is not only that. the government has authority going the other way. people versus prado, "in the absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must be indicted and convicted as such." if you look at this information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as an accessory after the fact.
i thought an assay was in effect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant data and you're using it in a more   i think, in answering justice breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower sense.
to be sure, your honor, there are times when they may miscalculate the nature of the concerns about safety and destruction of evidence, but, in cases where there aren't those concerns, they have nothing to gain. and, in addition, entering prematurely may make them a defendant in 1983 or bivens actions, which i'm sure that no officer  
counsel, do you think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always possible that some additional evidence would come up and you say, what if i had known that, i wouldn't have waived it?
i thought that one of the major things they were concerned about was retaliation against witnesses in the qui tam action, and that will always occur after. i mean, the   the suit for retaliation will then always occur after the qui tam action.
but what was introduced was   was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who said that wesley had told him that he was the shooter. so who was the shooter was   was as much an issue in wesley's trial as it was in stumpf's trial, wasn't it?
that's correct. that was our   our claim before the district court that ultimately wound up in the eighth circuit.
on   on this point, it seems to me there   unlike the first point you were discussing where i think the federal government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant federal interest involved. that is to say, if the united states takes the position that these are, indeed, inland waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.
  know of any other reason for the solomon amendment.
yes.
it's quite simple. if you look at that paragraph, there are two pieces of it. one of them, one portion says that you can regard it as an anticompetitive act if defendant purchased more logs than it needed. we don't think that needs to be improved because that's easy to figure out, and here we had evidence that they continued  
well, however got there  
our royal navy? (laughter.)
suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning   i don't know what it would be right now   that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983. i'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. but i mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas. now, suppose that's what the opinion said. we're absolutely making it clear just what the   would there be any harm done?
i think that's right. i think that's  
but the sixth amendment question  
well, if the objective review shows that there were, indeed, facts that would have justified an arrest, then what's wrong with allowing that to proceed?
they did not refer to it in their opinion.
mr. burman.
well, we think that if   by directing that the jury consider all evidence in both phases of the trial, it must be relevant. why else would they instruct the jury to consider such evidence, unless it was relevant to the sentencing questions the jury must answer? and obviously i agree with you, justice breyer, that if the   if a defendant must run the gamut of having   we have to remember that the first trial was set aside because it was defective in some way. and it would be an anomalous result for the resentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the first jury heard when the defendant had an unconstitutional, or a defective, trial. so  
okay.
there was some disagreement on the court about exactly what it revealed, but in terms of intimate details, it then allowed somebody  
what about   i mean, the person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says that to classify him, the state has to show that through repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by repeated class 2 rule violations.
i'm sorry, that is at page   i believe it's at 17 of the appendix. let me just make sure i've got the right   and that was when it talks about  
but does that finding rest on the conclusion that dr. blake was not credible and agent bigbee was credible?
well, the tort is against the police officers who made an unlawful arrest and exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold mr. wallace. the, the problem with saying that mr. wallace has to sue, as soon as he files his motion to suppress, he should have filed his section 1983 action, would produce a multitude of 1983 actions.
the   if you look at the ninth circuit opinion, the ninth circuit made it clear that the instructions as a whole provided sufficient guidance. nowhere in the case as we tried it did we attempt to exploit the instruction in the way that weyerhaeuser suggests happened.
i think the answer is yes, it must identify itself, but it doesn't help, because  
well, i recognize there are different schemes. the only one i'm familiar with is my former state. but did i understand from your answer that in some or many of these states, the employer is free not to have insurance? he can be self-funded?
mr. chief justice, i   i think that reading the transcript will show that the judge, hearing the batson motion, asking counsel to explain the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the doubt may refer back to the fact that there's a dispute about the challenged juror and whether she turned aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and disrespectful way. and the judge says, well, i didn't see that behavior, but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. but i think the ruling is a general one that subsumes both claims, youthfulness and demeanor.
  is that an "order" is a official complaint. so, they haven't preserved the point.
oh, yes, mr. chief justice, but   but quite a distance. the   as the balderas court  
  no possibility for discretion.
why not?
  interest.
and once we're there, it seems to me what we're arguing about is not this metaphysical thing about rights. we're arguing about what the treaty says. now, if that's so, i   i think we're back to where we were in the last case and say does this treaty or does it not, as a matter of american law, say that the person is entitled to some kind of remedy. and our problem there is that the icj has said, yes, it does, but it doesn't mention it, but it does say that you cannot have procedural rights that do not give full effect to the purpose of   of this section. so where are we?
does   does texas law provide that a   a living trust must be executed and administered with the formalities of a will?
but none   none of this has to be done for you to win this case, does it?
yes, your honor, it does.
  question, frankly. i mean, i can't imagine california would do this, but i guess if california did say that, "the period of time between the time you lost in the district court and the time you filed, in every other state, is 30 days, but, in california, it's a reasonable time. and what we mean by a 'reasonable time' is 3 years, without any excuses"   i guess, then, maybe the dissent in carey v. saffold would have been right in respect to that.
yes.
but the failure of the burden of proof is apparently a function of the fourth circuit's assumption that if you sue the parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal, you have an obligation to negate the possibility of suing any agent. and i don't see where that comes, except out of the sky somewhere.
i have that same problem. [laughter.]
it depends how else the aggravating factors are; what kind of a role the aggravating factors play now under mississippi statute. if the role is de minimus, then it's probably not a "weighing" state. but the "weighing" states   in the "weighing" states, the eligibility factors are the lynchpin of the sentencing decision.
they read our opinion which holds in your favor. then the next thing is in   in the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, i   i think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that the fbi had a retaliatory motive.
i see an administrative law statute. it sounds like that's the system they're imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to fail.
it's not a   a disparate impact claim i say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. the statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.
do i get a decal after i go through all this procedure? you have a whole form. i pay $6 for alabama. i pay $2 for idaho, and   but   but i do it all in one shopping place which happens to be michigan.
in the one in 1,000 or one in 5,000 cases, equitable principles would then apply. the distinction may not be clear between statutory tolling, what the statute actually provides for, and equitable tolling, equitable principles that have been applied by the court.
thank you, mr. kise. ms. millett, we'll hear from you.
well, one part of one of them. in factor (a), there is one reference to special circumstances, and that's  
correct, and  
i think he was on notice. the blm made a determination that because it wasn't recorded, it wouldn't seek to enforce that against respondent. it may be that it was   it made a legal error on that; i don't know. but it made that determination  
that's true, your honor. at the same time, this   bringing this   this case in 1983 in federal court means that they're not going to be able to get injunctive relief on state grounds under the pennhurst doctrine. so they are depriving themselves of a chance to get that type of meaningful relief that ohio courts are offering and that courts in other states are offering. the other   the other point i wanted to make is that with respect to petitioner johnson's argument, his understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole revocations can't be in habeas either. a parole   parole   when you're on parole, you're still serving part of your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial term that the court has imposed upon you. granted, you're not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't impact your sentence. it would merely bring you back into prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than having you serve it on the street. so i think that understanding of sentence can't make sense for   for habeas purposes.
29 versus 14.
but that's purely   pure question begging. i mean, the whole issue on the merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not. and you can't assume that you're correct when the remand provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been remanded doesn't care whether you're correct. the idea is, you can get a correct determination in state court through up to review by this court eventually, as you can in federal court. there's no reason to assume that the federal court is the only place you would get a correct determination.
i think, though, that there's   there would be no particular reason to believe that the warrant application had been   had served as the basis for the guilty plea. i mean, if you had some sort of  
on   on that point   on that point, in the federal circuit judge dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the government because he said three times i said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. and he said, i asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. so since the government declined to tell the court what programs   existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as i think the federal circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?
  that law applies to this case at this time, correct?
they don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not. it's not an essential part of their case. their case is even if it did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end of case.
complex defendants can make for complex cases. (laughter.)
well, justice ginsburg, i think it's critical in this case that it   the court never forced a lawyer on respondent in this case.
yes. but they also argued that jones failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on everything but his first amendment retaliation claim. or what they termed his negative work  
may i ask this question just to help me sort of   what are the   as a matter of state law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was convicted?
but your answer was it shouldn't, i think. i think she's making your argument for you.
yes.
is the test for going to the jury the same as the test for whether or not discovery can proceed?
  burden-of-proof cases. what is your closest one where the courts are left to do this? what do we look to?
okay.
if those findings aren't there, it's not reasonable.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted. [ whereupon, the case in the above-titled matter was submitted at 11:04 a.m.]
  substances act  
i'm   i'm not aware of   i'm not aware of a number, justice stevens.
well, i don't think so, justice scalia. i mean, first of all  
i do not believe the court should stay it. digging it would be an option. i also believe   i believe the most correct  
then we would not have this crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the united states understand, and the worst thing that would happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless-error analysis, and thus, if justice scalia is right about it, you would lose, and if   because it would be harmless   and if he's wrong about it, you'd win.
what was   the argument was that, in california, the burden of proof is on  
mr. nolas?
but i assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences. you would indicate the difference between the jewish, the roman, the protestant, the lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here. i would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions. but it's not comparable to school teaching.
well, actually   this is   to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not. now, if that's where we're getting there, the history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.
well, it would  
  role would govern whether a continuing violation occurred? would it be  
right. and this is not the only place where that consequence can arise. there are   there are cases involving "what's a crime of violence?" which is   which, under subparagraph (g), is another aggravated felony. the crime of violence is defined in 18 u.s.c. section 16, subsection (b) of that   this court considered that statute in leocal   requires that the offense be a felony which creates a serious risk of physical harm. the courts have looked to the state law of conviction to determine whether something is a felony  
well, the problem is is that in the meantime thousands of michigan indigents are going to be denied counsel.
it absolutely is, justice o'connor, but  
yes, your honor, that is correct.
yes. respondent represents that the stay of execution was entered in the district court and it stayed in effect.
  irrelevant thing.
of course, the other way to read the language is that the state application is final   otherwise you couldn't file the federal petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect what happens with your application for state relief, but the state application itself is final and over.
but that wasn't your assertion even in this motion for a hearing. it wasn't that he didn't know what he was giving up. it was rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not establish that petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence. rather, it shows that petitioner gave up that right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in frustration with his attorney during that particular proceeding."
this court did not  
didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the   the csc, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?
well, that's probably how the government viewed it, your honor. but certainly i don't think one should ascribe for purposes of implied repeal, in other words to assume a presumption, by making the congress prescient of what this court was going to decide in 1995. and i certainly wouldn't concede, although the petitioner would like to argue, that williams' holding is as broad as it is. williams was about a very particular situation, a woman, as i said, who had a lien placed on her, and the court didn't answer this question of whether someone who had, as justice ginsburg indicated, who had a levy placed on there, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346 as this court held in williams. justice kennedy, also on your question about the tax code, although we don't cite it in our brief, estate of ramani is another case in which this court had in effect held that a specific provision in the tax code, in this very tax lien act, took priority over a more general provision that had to do with the priority of the united states' claims. and that's estate of ramani, 525 u.s. 517. i believe if there are no further questions, the government would ask the court to find that 7426 is the   except i have one more thing to add. getting lots of help today from all quarters.
how about racist literature but it's under the aegis of a religious organization? and that   suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member of the aryan nation to get that racist literature   to get racist literature but  
they entered and announced their presence, and they were not heard when they did that. so the knock is   is normally the appropriate course, but in certain circumstances, the knock may either be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon what was happening, and it certainly could waste some time if it was a dire emergency. the   under the fourth amendment, a police officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a reasonable officer could conclude, given again all the circumstances, that an impending threat to life or safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the nature of the emergency. whether the officer was subjectively motivated to enforce the law or render aid has no relevance in a constitutional inquiry. volatile situations involving violence in the home can escalate in   in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second judgment about exactly when the police officers should intervene is precisely what the totality of the circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the balance of the fourth amendment values. and this court's recent decision in georgia v. randolph contains a clear expression of concern for the need for the police to take prompt action to prevent harm in domestic violence cases. in this case  
we think that the balance that congress struck in title vii was from   between deterring all forms of discrimination and not   not allowing every employee grievance to become a federal court case. i think the court has recognized repeatedly not all work place conduct that's offensive or even harassing violates title vii, and we think that that same compromise should inform the court's interpretation of section 704 of the statute. if there are no further questions.
no, actually, justice  
no, but if  
the only issue of federal law here that is determinative is whether or not the agents gave proper notice of the seizure. and interestingly, justice ginsburg made reference to the well-pleaded complaint rule. there is a secondary issue in this case, and that is that the disputed issue of federal law was not part of the well-pleaded complaint. there is no dispute that the irs failed to give the statutorily required notice of personal notice.
but don't we have to be more specific about the context in determining whether there's disruption? if it's a school trip to an art museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object of the trip. unfurling a banner in a classroom is going to be disruptive to the teaching of shakespeare or whatever is supposed to be going on in there. what we have here is the unfurling of a banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing snowballs waiting for some   somebody to run by with a tv camera nearby. and there is a real question as to whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything. and if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to favor the right to suppress it?
yes. assuming  
the   the case, as far as i'm thinking of it at the moment, comes down to everybody is agreeing   well, no. it's   you go ahead because you want to reserve that probably.
that's my  
  "factor (k)"  
  why, when this is in equipoise, he is more deserving of death than the average.
  literal reading of the statute to   i agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it. i agree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side. i agree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular language. so, look at the phrase and read the language as you want me to read it.
sorry?
the answer is yes?
thank you, mr. marcus.
okay.
correct.
you either have to have an erroneous instruction or a special verdict.
no, i understand, but what are you   what are you going to argue to that jury? are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that, "yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of his guilt was really not all that clear, and you should take that into"   don't you want to make that argument?
mr. blanchard, may i ask you a question. i just want to understand. wachovia has branch banks all over the country. are they generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the bank?
the   anything that requires the secretary to proceed by order?
could have made it. so   so we're going to   why can't life be simple? we're going to have to have trials all the time as to whether, in this hypothetical situation, this finding could have been made. i mean, you know, this creates subsidiary litigation that we really don't need.
what's your response to that?
the answer is yes, it does  
has any knowledge of  
the fact that you find out something?
it's just an additional item in the list.
you should agree with that. you should   (laughter.)
well, the 17-year-old may be the ringleader, and even if you posit that christopher simmons was the ringleader here, he   he wasn't under any illusions. he wasn't making a statement about being executed. he said, we could get away with it, which speaks volumes about the   the extent to which   this guy was subject to life without parole, which is, justice scalia, fundamentally different than death. this court has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature of the crime and the act. but the data shows   and i think this court has acknowledged   it acknowledged in thompson in any event   that the   that adolescents like the   the mentally retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very substantial penalty. the   no mature adult would have thought, as chris simmons reportedly said, i can get away with this because i'm 17 years old, when the mandatory punishment for him would have been life in prison. it's   it is not   eliminating the death penalty as an option, which is   which is imposed so rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was in furman   three states in the last 10 years, one  
i think so. i think honing   what this court has talked about in honing is   is refining a case before a second trier of fact. and as a matter of massachusetts' procedures, certainly the prosecution may be able to reopen if there's good faith or mistake, but for purposes of  
but perhaps they were worried that they didn't have a case without the defendant's statements.
  proper place to look. official
suppose all of the   suppose there are five circuits. they're the only ones that looked at the issue. and they all say, we think the general rule of the supreme court is as follows, isn't that entitled to some weight? you're not supposed to cite that when you go to the sixth circuit court or you go to the state court?
but, your honor, that would be a reason why this case should go back to the district court, because that's the judge who tried the case.
not that i'm aware of.
well, you know, i think that the   with respect to constitutional violations that might not relate to people with disabilities, you know, that's something congress could certainly consider in other legislation. here, congress would   had, staring in front of it   right?   a record of constitutional violations that showed   right?   proven constitutional violations showed that the 1983 remedy, which doesn't authorize damages against the state, wasn't working. we need to have some additional remedy. we need some additional deterrents and spur to compliance on the part of states. but i think it's also important to note how limited the damages remedy in this context is. it's not just the absence of punitive damages. it's not just   you know, we also have the provision of the plra that says no damages for mental and emotional injury in the absence of physical injury, which means that, in the kinds of cases that are peripheral to core constitutional rights, we're not going to have damages anyway. it also   we also have the exhaustion requirement of the plra, which imposes on plaintiff the requirement that they go to the prison and tell them, "here's the problem," which means that if we have a case that satisfies the plra, we're very likely to have deliberate indifference, a problem that prison officials have refused to resolve  
well, there are several gradations that the court could take: advocacy of illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of illegal drugs. but i believe   i think it's important to recognize that this court's precedents recognize   recognize several different justifications for restricting student speech. in tinker itself which dealt with political speech, the court was careful to point out that even then, if the speech could be shown to present a threat of a material disruption to the class work, and i think this would answer your question, mr. chief justice, if the teacher wants to teach shakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the class to political speech.
  that's an interesting question. let's turn from the more cosmic questions into how you overcome the impediment that in order to get a certificate of appealability here, you have to show that there was   you have to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. what constitutional right has been denied here?
that is if one assumes that the civil remedy   that the 1983 actions has no teeth and has no force, and i don't believe that's true at all.
but if you think  
  on the  
the court obviously is correct to accept that finding. as you know, from the district court's finding, the secular purpose that was accepted by the district court was to honor the fraternal order of eagles. but also there was an ongoing  
you seem to have taken the position that the state cannot cure an edwards violation, which seems to me quite different from the trial court's ruling, because the trial court made a number of factual statements that seem to me to be saying, "had these things been done, the violation might have been a   cured." she referred to the fact he was still undressed, still in a cold cell, that his parent   there was no parent present. he was scared, and   he was scared and thought he was facing death. now, it seems to me the logical inference from the trial judge's statement is, "had each of those things been different, i might have found a cure."
  "too much," because that  
you've never tried it.
yes. if it's ambiguous, and you look to the legislative history, i think we get considerable mileage from barrett. the congress was pretty clear that what it was doing was codifying barrett. the barrett approach, which was then followed by the bia for more than a decade, was that they would count state drug crimes, but only if they were felonies under the federal statutes, under the controlled substances act. so, i think we get considerable mileage out of that.
well, on that  
what  
right. and then on appeal, we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes, it is a strong inference. i mean, i hope we're going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether there's a strong inference or not.
general  
does it say what you just said?
this  
thank you mr. shanmugam. mr. miller.
yes. in fact, i think it's very helpful. it's listed at page 7a  
am i correct in understanding that at the end of the line here, if you win the federal money will go to your two districts, whereas if the other side wins the federal money will go to the state? is that what the bottom line is?
and they'd be better off to represent a real client.
right.
well, but the facts of the triggering event are not always going to be so clean, and in many cases they're going to require an exercise of judgment by the officer. i mean, if the triggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of marijuana or something and they see a big box coming in, they're going to have say, well, is that what they're talking about or is   you know, is that it. and the point is under the fourth amendment that those types of judgments are supposed to be made by the magistrate and not by the officers on the scene.
well, why wouldn't that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to chapter 7?
well, respectfully, your honor   and i know that that is the petitioner's argument and i see that you have given me that question, but i don't know that it is that much of a choice. i mean, i think that they can file, they can file both in those circumstances and, and depending on the particular circumstances   and this is back to the equitable tolling principles   for statutory tolling purposes, i think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit the right to one or the other. if they choose not to file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90 days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within the statutory period then they have under aedpa missed the statute of limitations deadline. but i would, i submit to you that it is possible to do both, and in circumstances where there is some impediment to them doing just that, if they exercise diligence, if they are doing everything they possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the same time, well, then i think under the facts of the proper scenario that equitable principles might apply. but again, to say that congress built into the system this automatic time period that's going to be tacked on to a very short one-year statute of limitations, a statute of limitations that is designed to really move things through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, i don't think the correct interpretation of the language, and i don't think it is consistent with what this court said in duncan or, with respect to justice breyer, what this court said in carey.
very much the opposite, your honor.
the case is submitted.
  it statewide?
i thought that's what kroger was about. it said, yes, that you could do it   that the plaintiff then couldn't turn around and sue the third party defendant.
at the trial.
yes.
why isn't that basic research? i mean, i want to   i want to treat this disease by stifling the development of blood cells around it, or something like that, and then you ask yourself, "gee, what would stifle the production of blood cells?" and let's assume there hasn't been any research done in that field before. you wouldn't consider that basic research, so long as the idea i have in my   in my head is, i want to create a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood cells?
yes. the pecos river   i mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that mr. robbins pointed out. one difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the pecos river case   neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard. in this case, there is a party that objects to it. and i would   i think there's another difference that's important that the court ought to keep in mind. at the time the pecos river master was appointed, federal rule of civil procedure 53(e), which the court has said that the federal rules provide a guide for this court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the court, indeed, used that mechanism for the   it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard. as of 2003, rule 53   it's now rule 53(g)   provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise. therefore, at the present time   and again, following the court's rule 17.2 that says that the federal rules of civil procedure should be guides   and i think they are a useful guide   the appropriate course here, if the court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo. but that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any. the parties will submit the evidence to the river master. he'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the court. that's really more what the special master does at the current time. so i think that under all of those circumstances, both the court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the court's recognition that it's the court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't   it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, i think that the court should not appoint a river master in this case. as far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the united states also that the special master and colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded. i think it's a familiar principle in   to this court in litigation that if a party   when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the court to hear them. in this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to   what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years   the   the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest. now, kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950. we should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one. but they never made the objection that if you   if the court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect. that was the time that kansas should have brought it to the court and kansas didn't do that.
they all purchased  
  that   no. you are correct in representing that the government's approach to this will take what is quintessentially a question of law, that is, a comparison of adjudicated elements of   adjudicated elements of conviction against   compared to the elements of generic burglary. that's a question of law. do they match? do they not match? it becomes a question of fact then, as the first circuit put it in shepard and in the harris case, to determine what was actually in the mind of the defendant at the time he entered his plea.
the testimony   officer brill's testimony? is actually   they cite joint appendix number   on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. on the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked   they continue to ask the question. and isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, iris mena was released? that would sound consistent. and that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. in addition, ms. mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. the   the point being   and if you take the distance between officer muehler's testimony and officer brill's testimony, ms. mena was   was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take ms. mena's testimony into account. and one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that mr. romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. and so while this  
thank you, mr. taranto. mr. verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.
mr. phillips, i   i tend to agree with that, but i   i just hate to get the lower courts into this business of determining when a corporation is going beyond its business. your   your discussion with justice souter i think indicates how   how hard that is, or some of the examples that the government brings up, such as a drug company that   that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws. is that part of its business or not part of its business? i   i really don't   don't want to buy into that.
what do you want to say about that? because that is a concern i have.
all right   i guess that   they must have thought that there were 15 or more employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.
well, i mean, should we answer the question he now   perhaps in his minimalist position   might want to raise, or maybe did, that section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction. the judge's causation instruction in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's causation instruction on contributory negligence, if there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the defendant's negligence. and he says that isn't what happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one of them was this equivalence thing. so he's saying to us: decide it, say that they were wrong. what's your view of that?
no, but every lower court that has   not every one; you know better than i   but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the rule 15 and have looked to tiller. is that true, or not true?
well, because i don't actually think that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming infringing use. i just think that's   it's not a   it's not a  
all right. so we don't know what the government's position is. they're not here. so suppose i think, one, the language is against you, the language of the statute. i do think it's against you. two, the eeoc reg does foresee a disparate impact test. three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and that has to go with the scope of the statute. and four, it might be possible for the eeoc to write a reg that deals with the problems you're worried about while advancing a disparate impact test. suppose i think all those things  
if there was a good reason, they could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't. but justice ginsburg has set forth what sounds to me like an excellent reason, that the judge discovered he had made an error that could mean life or death or jail or innocence, and before that opinion issues, i want to be sure it's correct. now   now, that's how i'm thinking, that the general practice is contrary to what you say, that the question is a good reason, and that here there could hardly be a better one. so what is your response?
but now we've heard it doesn't embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the eeoc isn't here to tell us  
it needs to allege enough specifics  
well, it's so odd, because usually what happens, if there is something that could occur at the state court level, is the state court itself would hold off until this court had resolved whatever the case was. so, this is a very unusual request.
but this court has said that the standard for   the standard for express waiver varies, depending on the right at stake. it's not always intentional relinquishment of a known right, as it is with some constitutional rights. in fact, there are several courts of appeals that have said when you plead   when you affirmatively plead the opposite of an affirmative defense, as they did here by saying it's timely, that that's enough for an express waiver. and  
well, i   i think that you can adopt objective criteria as you have in the noerr v. pennington doctrine to separate the two.
i'll   i'll grant you that, but it seems to   i mean, justice ginsburg responded to that by saying that these things get sorted out. at the beginning you get all sorts of loony claims. as time goes by, you get fewer of them. and   and if   if they weren't getting few of them, i would have expected the united states to make a different representation.
now, the new policy goes on to say, the classification committee shall document information presented by staff and the inmate which is form 2627 and 2628. and i don't know where 2698 fits in, but 2698 are all those pages with the information.
you mean the judge just has to watch the case sail over the waterfall and  
well, it seems to me you're saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. can you think of any area of the law in which we say whatever it takes, so long as there's a real need, whatever it takes   i mean, if we have a lot of crime out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use warrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the protections of the bill of rights, whatever it takes, we've got to do it? is there any area of the law that doesn't have some absolute restrictions?
according   i know what their rule is. their rule is a judge can change his mind up to the point that the jury is dismissed, something like that. i understand that. now, i want to know what your rule   is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes the word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says, oh my god, i meant to say no acquittal? too late. too late. okay, now, so i want to know what your rule is. is that the rule?
your honor, he plead guilty to the offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him and his lawyer; in other   and the government   which is basically the instruction that was given in this case. when he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said, despite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the time, that he had done anything unlawful or improper. he said, "i thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate. i plead guilty because i was persuaded that it didn't matter what i thought at the time."
but the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it.
well, i   i assume   i assume your response is that if you eliminate from the boykin rule the possibility of implicit consent, you are forcing the lawyer who believes he has the consent of   of a   an intractable client such as this fellow who   who didn't go into the courtroom, took all his clothes off so they couldn't take him into the courtroom. he was obviously not   didn't want to be responsive. your   you would have forced this lawyer to adopt a strategy which the lower court found would have been damaging to this defendant, even though the lawyer believes that the defendant really approved of the strategy that the lawyer was undertaking. why would we want to adopt a rule like that?
well, several things, your honor. first of all, of course, there can be no legitimate reliance in lower court precedent that's contrary to supreme court precedent, and it was an open secret in the patent bar that the approach being taken by the federal circuit was inconsistent with cases such as this court's sakraida decision.
well, what about the difference in language under 706(a) and the other provisions? 706(a) says the debtor may. the other provisions call for action by the court, which suggests at least that the authority to convert is greater under 706(a). official
because it's  
i, i   i don't agree. and here's why, your honor. tennard was itself both a habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism act, like these two cases. and so in tennard the court was called on to decide not squarely the question of whether the state court decision in that case had been objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable jurist could have found it to be objectively unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability was warranted. mr. tennard's case was decided by the state court in 1997, so i think it is immanent in this court's ruling in tennard that at least as of 1997, it was apparent that a, a low iq score alone implicated the concerns of penry.
but the state has a certain amount of flexibility in deciding when to respond, does it not?
but he could have. he could have. i mean  
absolutely not, your honor. the prosecutor did not commit misconduct. the prosecutor made a mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar to what boyde contemplated when they set forth the general standard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood   misunderstand an instruction is   is almost the same when   when you're analyzing whether the question is prosecutorial misconduct. boyde sets forth the test for how to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and boyde said that at the first instance, a statement of the prosecutor is not to be considered as having the same force as instructions from the court. and that principle was recognized by the california supreme court and reinforced  
all right.
it would have a fair amount of information. however, in california, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not. it follows some period of time later from the county.
well, they do cite mccarthy, but i would submit that mccarthy is incorrect, in this case.
mr. kneedler, could i ask you about your assertion that you "look to the state of conviction"? what do you mean by that? for purposes of 1101. does that mean, if you're convicted, in state court, of a misdemeanor   and even though that action would be a federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?
well, it could be, your honor, but i   congress included the language. i think this court could give meaning to it by interpreting the statute to mean that you would be looking at a decision of the court of appeals rather than a decision from a district court.
that is  
it's like a 3-day fishing license.
he said  
that's what i thought.
6 percent is the total emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in the united states, right?
the state could do that and that would be perfectly permissible.
the only way to be the principal offender under that specification is to be the triggerman. so that   that's clear from the face of the indictment in   in wesley's case that the state had argued that. now, the jury, importantly in wesley's case, found that he should be acquitted on that aggravating circumstance. it's not an element of the crime, but it's one of the aggravating circumstances that the state could rely on in seeking the death penalty in wesley's case, and the jury specifically rejected that aggravating circumstance and   and found that the state had not proved it beyond a reasonable doubt. throughout the   throughout the appellate process, with regard to the sentence, the state's attorney argued that, yes, there's evidence in the record from which you could conclude that he's the actual shooter, but in any event, it doesn't matter. and the   the state's attorney was correct in that, as a matter of ohio law, aiders and abetters can both be found guilty of aggravated murder under ohio law and are subject to the death penalty. the two   the two aggravating circumstances   i'm sorry. the one aggravating circumstance that remained after the plea deal turned merely on the reason why mrs. stout had been put to death. it did not turn at all on who was the person who put her to death. so as an accomplice, aider, and abetter, with liability for the aggravated murder, he was also subject to the death penalty under that  
that's true, mr. chief justice. our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on specific facts that have been found in state court. the (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable. and to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only, i think, being contrary to congressional intention when aedpa reforms were adopted, and your cases that have applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent tests   in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering. if you take out the capital cases, the non-capital federal habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a federal evidentiary hearing. so the result of reading that (e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case means basically the state loses the presumption for almost every habeas claim that we look at. so it would seem to not be also supported by the statute's clear terms. there's no limitation written into (e)(1) that it   it's   doesn't apply across the board to all habeas claims. the  
  said in rostker.
  is my understanding. suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits five manslaughters. would they be liable   and gained for $1 million. would they be liable for twice a million dollars in every manslaughter case?
well, i don't want to get us too far off the track on this question, but it just seems to me that what you've done before bears on what you know, or have reason to know, on an ongoing basis.
counsel presented it as though it's a complete summary of everything, but what it says is, and the other facts and market circumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by  
yes.
well, no. actually what i'm saying is that 1367(a), in effect, codifies both aspects of the kroger   of this court's decision in kroger. in kroger, the court said you would have ancillary jurisdiction over the third party claim that i identified for justice breyer, and that that would fall within 1367(a) under my interpretation of it, but that 1367(b) would not allow the plaintiff then to bring a subsequent action against the third party defendant.
that's correct. and   and the problem here is what the danger was what would happen if the officers left. when   when the officer came in and saw a frightened ms. hammon, he saw wreckage on the floor, he had reason to be concerned that there was a very recent attack on her and that if he left the scene, that attack would be renewed. asking ms. hammon what happened was reasonably necessary to determine whether that emergency existed and, if so, how to resolve it. now, once he had that information, he had what he needed to resolve the emergency, and at that  
justice ginsburg, we disagree with the characterization that the u.s. rules the world, of course. we're talking about the fact that congress exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in its ports and internal waters, just as in   take the cunard example. in the cunard case, there were countries   and i understand it didn't involve the structure of the ship, but the principle is the same. there were countries that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels, and  
yes, that is my understanding of their position.
  constitutional violations.
suppose the judge had said this defendant has just been convicted of killing two people. he convicted them   as the jury knows, he was convicted of having killed them because he wanted to avoid being sent back to prison. the jury may sit there and think, well, if he killed two people to avoid being sent back to prison and we've just voted him guilty, maybe he's going to try to lunge out in the courtroom and get us. and therefore, i want him shackled. now, suppose the judge had said that. would that be an adequate reason?
he might. he might because the   the   i mean  
no, because our position is that placing it in subsection (h) evidences that congress' intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering. the  
well, suppose that it was an assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to decide whether it was violent or not, and the police report was somewhat ambiguous. could you   you couldn't look at it then.
what do you think about that? there are at least some circumstances, then, in which there this is kind of critical assessment function that you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if it gets to the strong points.
in litigation in other courts. they   did   did they ever say there is no claim or issue preclusion in other courts as a result of   of our denials?
and you would be here defending the statute on   in my hypothetical case.
actually inmates, particularly the worst of the worst, are quite clever at using newspapers. a newspaper rolled tightly with toothpaste used as an adhesive can be compacted into very nearly the equivalent of a nightstick.
yes, your honor, it would if in fact section 760 were ambiguous. it is, however, not ambiguous. it is plain on its face, and in fact the supreme court did not state that any term or phrase in section 760 is ambiguous. instead they referred to their divination of voter intent. and i believe, your honor  
i think that when your honor used the word far, that that   that that is not really fair. there are really very, very few contracts in the united states of america in 2005 that are going to be struck down because there wasn't enough consideration. that sort of argument against contract formation very rarely comes up. i do a ton of consumer contract cases. we've never gotten rid of a contract on the grounds there wasn't consideration. these doctrines are on the books. they are certainly part of what makes a contract different from an agreement. it's certainly one of the reasons why i think it's important that congress chose such a loaded word, but these   there are very few cases that involve this. and   and one thing about the   about the illegal issue and the voidability   the   the void ab initio issue that your honor raises. in florida   and we cited a number of cases of this in our brief and in the   in   both in our brief and   and in the contract law professors' amicus brief, there's a number of cases around the country. you only strike down a contract as void ab initio where the principal purpose, the essence of the contract is that   that it was to do an illegal purpose, was that it was to violate a statute as reflected in   as   as it would reflect the public policy of a state. you could have a contract that has one or two illegal provisions or minor legal provisions. those are not enough to get the entire contract thrown out as void ab initio. it's a much higher test. if i can use an analogy. there may be a lot of people who wish they weren't married, but meeting the tests of annulment are very different from divorce. trying to prove that a contract is void ab initio such that it is so extremely illegal that no provision of it will come into contract doesn't come up very often. what we are talking about with void ab initio contracts that violate public policies and statutes are we are talking about businesses that are skirting around on the edge of legality. we are talking about a business where there is a colorable argument that someone can go into court and say, this entire line of business is loan-sharking. it's a crime. it's 29 times the   the felony rate of loan-sharking in florida. that's why so many of these cases are payday lending cases. you don't see a lot of void ab initio cases in which come   someone comes in and say, hey, you know, they sold me a car and the entire line of business of car selling was void ab initio. the only example that's supposed to show the flood gates that has come from petitioner's brief is they cite to this vacation beach case in florida. and what   that was a case that involved was sort of a uniquely florida problem, but after a bunch of hurricanes, they've had people come down who were unlicensed contractors and they go and say we know how to fix roofs and so forth and they do not. and then people's roofs blow off, and there have actually been a number of people who have died. so the state set up a licensing regime that was a licensing regime not designed to extort money from businesses, but a licensing regime designed   scheme based on safety and health and welfare of the citizens and said, you can't go into this line of business without passing certain certifications. so in that case, it was a declaratory judgment action in which a company   in which a company comes in and says, this company is falsely representing they know how to do this work and they don't. and in fact, the court of appeals notes it could be a crime. and now petitioner comes in and says, well, this is an outrage. of course, the arbitrator should decide that question in the first place. no. that's a business that is arguably   and probably more than arguably   operating on the outskirts of the law. their reliance interests are different.
that's correct. the government has not made any allegation that there's  
so why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?
well, if  
thank you, mr. simon. mr. frederick, you have three minutes remaining.
well, that's because  
that's correct.
in missouri?
i don't believe there was such a finding. i think that the california supreme court decided that the exaction met the state law compensation requirements and did not  
  set forth  
so we can treat it in effect   and this may be the way to do it   we can treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the washington appellate court and that's what they said?
through today? i'm sorry. oh, from the time of its inception?
why not?
  along the side of the river.
i'm simply making the point that you are reading merrill lynch   merrell dow in a rather rigid way. and yet, there is this language in it that says in   in   what was before the court in merrell dow made perfectly good sense in that tort action to have it going on in state court. this is quite a different picture.
  then   then you would concede that if this was unlawful, the error clearly would not be harmless.
i'm not dismissing it. i understand it.
well, that's   that's sort of a horse race. i'm   i'm not sure, even if i agreed with your theory, that   that what the constitution requires changes on the basis of an evolving common law. of course, it can only change in one direction. right? it can only change favorably to   to your client, favorably to the defendant. it can't change to be more harsh to the defendant because the constitution prohibits that.
i guess broadly speaking no; in certain cases yes.
no, i don't.
that's true of title ii, as well as title i?
your honor, if a federal judge wished to impose a life term, there would have to be something to justify it, or it would be reversed on appeal.
hans   hans is residual sovereign immunity.
but that's your theory and it seems to me you're stuck with it. and if that theory is true, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to some other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same amount you bought it for.
it's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.
your time is up. that's  
thank you, mr. marshall.
but you have the same problem if it's students, i take it? you'd have the same statistical question whether you, you use districts or students?
well, i'm not so sure, because a voluntary waiver is measured against a miranda warning. and, by definition here, you don't have a miranda warning, because we're asking about "whether initiation." so, it seems to me there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determine whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that   it does not comprehend or require a miranda warning. otherwise, you're double counting.
there is that suggestion, i think, in judge mcconnell's opinion, and that's  
mr. johnson, when i asked you about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a california statutory cite, but is there   does it come from any model code? does any other state have such a provision? how widespread is it?
in the government's   in the official respondent's brief, they talked about how risk and potential and serious, some of those worlds potentially knock each other out, and i apologize for using that very word, but  
your honor, i know of no case where an appellate court would do such a thing when there's no motion of any kind that's ever been made contesting the  
yes.
that's   that may well be. and i want to be clear, i am not here arguing that this court should decide that there is no circumstance possible where something that occurs in the premises is not causally connected to the failure to knock and announce. all i'm asking the court to decide is that causation is required before the exclusionary rule is implemented, and physical evidence found within a proper search of   search of proper scope, pursuant to the warrant, that that is not causally connected to the   to the knock-and-announce violation. there may be other  
that's why  
  because for every factor that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that makes them morally the other way. so they're different, but they're not morally different. now, that's   that's what i think this case presents. and i   i mean, i imagine a juror who's thinking just what i said. i don't know if there ever was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the statute in this instant tells him what to do.
they should have given away the rest.
but what if the employment contract is with an american citizen to act as an espionage agent and nobody else knew about it. would   would that   would he be treated as an espionage agent or as an employee?
i mean, the wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's outside the scope. it's like one employee shoots another, you know. there is nothing to do with scope of employment there, it's plainly outside. and of course, this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an act that allows the ag to defend that kind of thing. but if it's arguable at least that something happened, if it happened at all it was within the scope of official employment, the ag can defend it.
okay.
yes. hazen paper established that that is not  
no. for that i would cite judge posner's decision.
so if we adopt your rule, a person calls up on the phone and says, i'm here at the baseball game, there's a terrible crime going on in front of me, and he describes it  
and   and while this court considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands of michigan defendants will be denied the right to counsel  
wasn't there competition in   in the   in the retail market? i mean, if i had two stations in front of me and one was selling gas 2 cents cheaper, i'd   i'd go to the one that was 2 cents lower. isn't that competition?
  then the first step is for this court   as the ninth circuit did, is to look at whether california performed a proper clemons review, which is that the appellate court looks to see whether there is a principled and complete harmless-error review. the ninth circuit held that there was no such principled and complete review, because  
  with   there's a two-step process.
did the legislatures that have passed laws of the kind you describe have before them information that there is a rather high incidence of the victim being intimidated and therefore not showing up in court to testify?
i'm sorry. would you repeat that?
i don't know how you can   you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the   there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in   in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. that doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.
  but he did not do so. yes, sir. that   those facts  
but the district court   the district court   this way   [laughter.]
well  
well, in the first place it would apply in at least south carolina immediately because there is a sip that incorporates exactly the same language. and second of all, the notion that this regulation is inoperative on one side and fully operative on the other side make no sense. it makes much more sense to recognize that modification is the trigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that that incorporates this entire modification language.
would this case come out differently? you know, your client had an obligation to keep the state informed of   of his   his address so that they could send the tax bills to him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer does not keep the state advised of his current address, any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will suffice for all purposes.
your honor, i don't   i think that's   again, that   if you were to have a presumption that the arbitrator is always in favor of upholding a contract, that would seem somewhat in tension at the very  
well, including reasonable disagreement with the level of severity that the legislature has provided in the middle term. i mean, other legislatures may have provided higher severity and the judge says, i simply disagree with the california legislature. and it's a reasonable disagreement, because some other legislature might have done what i do.
i thought they were all in the same boat. so what the effect of this rule is   of the ninth circuit is that they would all fail to qualify  
  should not be protected under the first amendment.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
okay. now   now, this is one of the things that mixes me up here.
if that's   they would be on notice, that that conduct if true could subject them to a tort action under the federal tort claims act. there is no decision that the court of appeals or respondent has pointed to that would put the petitioners here on notice in the specific situation they confronted, that their actions could subject them to a constitutional tort which had never been recognized by any court, whether their actions could subject them to treble damages under rico.
and not rely on the 2-27 date.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i can't believe that a defendant in a criminal prosecution who is acquitted in a subsequent civil suit  
but his solution was not a disparate impact doctrine. his solution was  
does he have to think it's wrong to kill martians?
yes, your honor, and  
  that the federal circuit's own rule? it   it was, i thought, pretty clear what it told us in that footnote, that if we were ruling   making the ruling   the federal circuit law is, if you don't make the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal for insufficient evidence.
  conceivably could give them a claim  
no. there   there is probable cause that the magistrate has to believe that the videotape, which was one of the items to be seized, would be found at the premises at the time that the search was to be executed, which was represented in the affidavit to be after the delivery takes place. if, in fact, the warrant is executed at a time before the delivery takes place, then the warrant has failed to conform to the probable cause that supported it and the search would be unreasonable.
which ones are voted on? i've not heard of that. i mean, they might be, but it used to be that the   they circulate the report to all the members and the members read it, and if a member disagrees with it, they note their dissent. maybe it's changed. but i guess  
mr. moran, would you clarify an answer you gave to justice o'connor at the outset of the argument? you said there is no statutory right to get a no-knock warrant. but did you say, as a matter of case law and practice, that can be done in michigan?
yes, whenever straddle crimes, but   but they're the exception rather than the rule.
no, it is not enough, but what is critical in this case is that the knock-and-announce violation goes to the manner of entry, and the court has long recognized that the two predicates for seizure of goods inside a home, or arrest inside a home, are authority to enter the home, which is not contested here, and a lawful entry. and if either one of those two predicates is missing, then you have grounds to suppress the evidence; that is, the evidence inside the home is in the fruit of the unlawful entry.
well, the intermediate appellate court expressly said that its determination did not turn on who had pulled the trigger, that they would have reached the same conclusion independent of who pulled the trigger.
but isn't it relevant what the status of the person is? someone might not know   the police might not know that someone on the premises is a temporary visitor.
the   the presence or absence of motivation to devise something.
i thought it was because he didn't raise it again in the trial.
no, your honor. rehearing is to issues that were decided by this court. this court clearly did not speak to the meaning of the hobbs act. and so, it was completely appropriate for the seventh circuit to say that this court considered the issues, in terms of what extortion was about, whether the injunction is permissible under civil rico. if you look at the  
it's always good to be safe.
certainly not, your honor. because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in our experience and in the experience of the courts. but the same is not true in the resale price maintenance context. dr. miles has foreclosed the courts from conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look into this question. but the empirical data that are available would suggest that anticompetitive explanations for resale price maintenance do not have very much explanatory power. when you actually look at the cases that have been litigated, they involve manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases of any cartelization going on. so the anticompetitive explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do not appear to explain most of the retail price maintenance that has been litigated. it's true that retail price maintenance can but does not always result in price increases, but, as justice scalia pointed out, price is not the only thing that consumers care about. and there is widespread consensus in the economic literature and in this court's recent cases that price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand competition. in monsanto and business electronics, this court made clear that price vertical restraints, like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the non-price vertical restraints to which this court now applies rule of reason analysis. so the reason in  
  what happens if the prosecutor just says, gee, i   you know   or the   the prosecutor has died? you know, it comes up later in   in a habeas action. the prosecutor is dead.
no, no, no. i will get that later. let me deal with the charge. if he was charged with breaking into a boat, that's the end of this. okay?
but you're  
let me just be sure i understand your argument on 208. you're saying that 208, like the earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to official be an administrative remedy.
you're not willing to take such a limited position.
well, the bright lawyer in kansas who may have done that was the kansas legislature, following the unanimous decision of this court in chickasaw nation, saying, "if you want to avoid the potential problems that would exist, change"   and it's not just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal incidence of the tax, it's   of course, the economic burden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of distribution. the legal incidence of the tax, as i read this court's opinions, are   is, it is exactly what it is here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid. nobody else is liable for it. the distributor has to pay the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline. here, not only the language is as clear as it could be   i mean, the legislature specifically says it   but the operation of the statute   and the two   the   twice, the tenth circuit considered this   the tenth circuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. the two district courts that decided it before those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the legal incidence was on the distributor. the facts support that the legal incidence is on the distributor. and respondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it seems to me, acknowledge precisely that. they, in their effort to distinguish the central machinery case, which is the indian taxation statutes   and we're not   specifically said there, referring to central machinery, "the state tax was imposed on the sale of merchandise. the legal incidence of the tax there, as here, fell on the non-indian seller." so, the respondents have even said that, on page 16 of their own brief.
so is it possible if it's in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit official that debtor to the possession of certain property which he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't happen in 7? is that possible or not possible?
we take no position on that. they're not an issue in the case.
so   so as a matter of washington law, mr. recuenco's jury was properly charged and properly returned a verdict on the only offense litigated and that was the lesser offense of assault two with a deadly weapon.
district.
why doesn't it serve the purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the security? they'll not be just be claims for fees that would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but that the oversecured   the security will cover the interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the function of 506 whatever  
you   you can plate your whole fleet in michigan under those circumstances.
is it relevant at all? this happened 24 years ago. we're sitting here trying to think of what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the law that's a quarter of a century old and facts   i don't know what to think. i guess that's just irrelevant?
even if it might injure the creditors.
well   i think   i think the argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly. i think you can make an argument that what, you know, what we were entitled to was some variant. and that   our objection here is not  
  document claimed? intervention  
that may   oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're   you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. and i'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-congress argument.
we don't believe it's the defendant's burden, we believe we   the district court was correctly reversed by the ninth circuit in entering summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion. and the district court did that, because as i said it was absolutely irrelevant to the determination of used fairly.
  in the tax example. i mean, the taxes are apportioned. the part of the tax   or the business that would be taxable in the state gets taxed at a lower rate. businesses say, "gee, let's do more business in ohio and pay less taxes." in this case, they're getting, effectively, taxed at a lower rate, because they make an investment in ohio.
well, i think when the court of appeals does that, i think in all fairness, they should advise the parties in advance that they we're considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of time, and would you like to  
i don't think it's important, for, maybe, purposes of this, to iron this out, but i   respectfully, i don't agree with that characterization, because, even in the resolution of the grievance internally, the   what they found in the grievance was that they took no adverse action against him because of what he said  
what if you have a  
yes, you do, your honor.
  also  
they had   did they have any reason to know why they were holding him?
we're not arguing about that. i   i don't think anybody has asked you that question. the question is whether you can consider it at all, and   and you say no.
i don't think so, justice kennedy, because i look at this court's  
but, i mean, the   domino's itself viewed jwm as john mcdonald. the statement, we don't want to do business with you people   you people isn't anyone else other than john mcdonald. and the allegations go further than simply back wages and even the dignitary damages which are available under section 1981 but not under contract law is also alleged that by going after his credit and going after the banks that he had relationships with and given guarantees to and going after him personally, that this wasn't simply derivative of jwm's damages, that he had his own separate damages that, in fact, could not have been recovered by jwm had jwm filed a 1981 action.
  when you read it the first time, you think they're talking about the supreme court.
the lower   justice, i'm sorry.
no, no, but suppose we thought they were right? see, suppose you lost across the board? that would be the argument for holding it   - holding it because then you'd have another vehicle to get to these questions.
well  
that may be. the commerce clause remains alive and well, but the commerce clause  
with an e. with an e. but if   if you take my questioning as a compliment with an i, that's perfectly okay too. (laughter.)
well, two things. number one is that capital sentences have been dropping for all ages, not just for those under 18. so it   you have to take that into account. the second is that although the last  
to  
7426.
johnson still has remaining claims for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as well, declaratory relief. what may be mooted is his claim for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new parole hearing. i think in order for him to pursue that type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district court.
that's   that's relevant to the first prong, your honor. the second prong  
and then the question, of course, is let's imagine you're either right or you're wrong as to its being a regulatory taking. and maybe if it's   they have no reason for it at all, they can't do it. period. and if they have some reason for it, even a sort of bad one, they can do it. but if that's the context   we're in the game where they can do it   why should it matter, in respect to paying compensation, whether their reason is quite a good one or just barely good enough? and that's   that's the puzzle, i think, that the other side is putting to you, and i must say i'm rather moved by their argument because it seems to me whether it's a very good reason or just a barely adequate reason has nothing to do with whether they should pay compensation.
so  
well, justice scalia, i think justice breyer is testing a very particular piece of time.
i   i don't  
but it cannot do that by determining that they're in equipoise.
so there was nothing tangible behind his  
but the crucial  
the actual year-by-year results. right?
your honor, i'm agreeing with you on covered security. i'm   i'm saying that there then is the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive elements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the merits inquiry.
if they're invalid then i have   then i'm struggling to find what your test is.
general clement, there is usually great caution on the part of the court from tampering with the statute. so excision is one thing. you just drop a provision. that's not possible here. the court has been extremely reluctant about caret marks, which is what   there is no problem with what the legislature did. it just didn't do enough. so the court would have to add a provision. not subtract. there is nothing to subtract. there's an addition and courts have been reluctant to do that. they feel much more comfortable cutting something out than putting something in.
right. they do   they do not.
yes.
dier incorporates morse.
there was testimony to that effect, justice ginsburg. also, when   when respondent was hired, they had just lost their existing forklift operator, someone who had done that. in any event, i don't think the evidence will permit a court, if it agrees that material adverse employment action is the test, to overturn the jury's finding that the change here was materially adverse.
that's correct.
this is guidance?
and there's no difference between a capital case and a regular case insofar as the intelligence of that strategy is concerned because even when there is not a separate penalty phase, it is sometimes in the interest of the defendant to, in effect, throw himself on the mercy of the sentencer, whether that is the jury or the judge, by   by not contesting the   the fact that   that he did the acts charged. that   that occurs not just in capital case but in   in regular cases.
i don't know the answer to that, but it's absolutely clear. epa has never said official otherwise. and of course the idea that an nsps modification is required first, it would have been a big deal. there is no sign of it, and in fact there are specific examples. the example cited at page 23 of the government's opening brief in the preamble is a psd major modification that would not be an nsps  
then the trial occurs  
well, whether you apply garner or graham, the result is the same in this case. and let me explain why. what graham did is it expanded the garner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to include the entire range of use of force, deadly or nondeadly. and with regard to the factors that are to be considered in determining whether the use of force is reasonable under graham, the balance with respect to a fleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was already drawn by garner. garner created a bright light rule. graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test with all use of force applications. but with respect to deadly force and a fleeing suspect, garner still provides a bright line rule.
they are not, but in terms of whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would conflict, you would look to this document and they took as their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such conflicts. what they did   let me take your example specifically and then put   place it within the statutory framework. within the ada and a question of the combings, what they said is, that's right. in certain cases solas requires that the coamings be a certain height. if the coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be worried about water coming in below, that is not an accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it at all. above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp down, unless that's structurally infeasible. so they   what they did is they   and this is the broader point. they applied the rule of the ada that a change to the structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's readily achievable. and what the regulatory authorities determined is that if there is any conflict with solas at all, that change need not be made. now, you   justice o'connor, you also focused on the fact that there are some of our claims that implicate the structure of the ship. they are, however, a distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this because i don't think the other side has any good argument at all, under international law or anything else, that would explain why they can charge a person with a disability double.
again, your honor, i think with respect to an entertainer, an entertainer necessarily doesn't need an agent. neither does an athlete.
well, respectfully, your honor, that's not what the court said in doremus in describing everson. it didn't say the mere fact that some money being spent was enough. it said that there was a measurable appropriation or disbursement occasioned solely by the activities complained of.
it does.
no, it's not inconsistent. we don't take the position that a permanent deprivation is required, is required. a less than permanent is sufficient, as the ninth circuit stated in corona-sanchez. the ninth circuit has subsequently held that a joyriding offense is outside that definition because it includes a brief taking with an intent to return, and the last footnote of the government's brief, note 8, cites that ninth circuit case.
i think things have changed, justice scalia, since those common law days, for that reason.
  i don't think that at the end of the day, after all the tools of statutory construction are applied, there is a genuine and certainly not a grievous ambiguity. that is, there   there are two potential sources of ambiguity. one could simply be there's uncertainty about whether the word enterprise, taken alone, would typically be construed   nobody is contending  
well, your honor, again, there   there has to be some finality to the process, and   and here what the petitioner got was at the time a perceptively correct view of the law.
but it would be equally protected, your honor, if the government owned the facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too. this distinction  
but what they're worried about is will this word "incidental" and   be sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous claim, that the president can't go to a prayer breakfast. now does the word "incidental" do that? that's what i think  
what authority do you have for the proposition that when then federal law says subject to the same terms and conditions that they're referring to state regulation as opposed to the same federal regulation that applies to the national banks?
if the only thing left were discipline because he was tardy that day, was   didn't divulge the names of the other people holding the banner, that sort of thing, we couldn't  
that's an important point to me, but i don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so. and the reason i say that, i start with goldberg's opinion with harlan in schempp. and i know there are a lot of others, but i don't know if we've found a satisfactory test. and the point that they make is the government should be noninvolved with the religious, and it can't favor one over the other. but at the same time, we are a religious nation, where most people do believe in god and most of our institutions flow from the religious nature of our people. the city on the hill, proclaim liberty throughout the land. all of those are religious. so how can the government, without what they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to secularism, which they think would be wrong, become necessarily involved because of our traditions, but not go too far? now, i come to the conclusion very tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look at the divisive quality of the individual display case by case. and when i do that, i don't find much divisiveness here. now, i'm exposing the whole thing not because i'm accepting it, but i would love to hear what you think.
no, but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you've won.
but you're saying that the   the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the officer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest. isn't that what you're saying?
the other point is that there's a second component to watershed which is it must be a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished. there was cross-examination under ohio versus roberts. there   in crawford, the language of crawford isn't a sweeping indictment of   of roberts.
it remains as a congressional emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use that is not likely to confuse is allowed. that is what, this was a  
  i just said  
the finding of the tenth circuit was, of course, that it applied to these plaintiffs under these particular facts. and i think that's one thing to remember, how cautious and conservative this court and the first circuit in cool moose were. they didn't make a broad-based rule, and i don't interpret this decision and i don't interpret the teaching of this court in footnote 13 in tashjian is that we should come down and make some bright line rule that's always going to say we have to have a party-option open primary or not. we need to look at the factors. i think there are very few states that this would even apply to because, as we know, 21 states don't even have political primary registration.
about the court effectively saying, yes, here pay him and   and go on and skip away and continue violating it.
  tough, would it?
may i ask you the same question i asked your adversary? suppose, instead of a tax credit, they said, "we'll pay for the construction cost of a building, or we'll give you a piece of real estate, in order to get you to come in. part of big redevelopment progress"  
wasn't it conceded that there was a pollutant   that a pollutant was involved in that case?
justice ginsburg, three answers. first, congress wanted federal courts to make the decision, not monitor the decision. second, we agree the federal court has the power to remand the case. if all that's left is state law claims, the court doesn't have to keep it. and third, that is what   the regime that congress set up was designed because there is a risk of error. some district courts will get some slusa preclusion questions wrong. and the question before this court really is would congress have wanted those cases to stay in the federal courts subject to federal appellate review or  
and made a reasoned judgment about it.
that's correct, your honor.
well, there's   there's a further irony here in that revocable trusts are always promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of probate. and now you're   you're insisting that it has to be in probate.
but the restraining order has no meaning, your honor, unless the police are willing to enforce it.
well, they are, and that  
well, i think by, i mean, you know, the court's precedents in other areas has suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate service is provided in commerce but in order to get the services they have to take  
isn't that what you're saying?
but the  
well, it's not really a step analysis, a substantial step analysis. it is an overt act. it's some overt act manifesting your intent to actually  
  disparate impact.
as is a automobile accident, and it   the chief suggested to you that there are other kinds of people who deliver items. and that kind of negligence, you say, is within the exception.
  on the legal incidence of the tax, we suggested, in the chickasaw nation case, that a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence would be dispositive. so, why don't we read the statute and say the incidence is on the distributor, and that's the end of it?
  to empty their prisons  
your honor, i'm   i'm just trying to envision what that remand would look like. if the court were   if the   if the case were to go back to the second circuit and then go back to the district court for a finding that this delay resulted from mr. zedner's incompetency, that finding would be clearly erroneous. there is no   there is no basis  
before you do that, how much of a practical benefit would it be for children with disabilities and their parents, if you are successful here, in light of the complexity of the idea and the fact that this is an area where some parents are going to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional detachment from the litigation? if parents can represent their   can   a non-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be found if the parent made an effort to do that, they're going to be lured into trying to provide the representation themselves?
yes. the first question is whether he has established a violation of the right. and the rights that are alleged in this case that are before this court, or a right under the compensation clause of the fifth amendment to  
but do you think it's fair to interpret the second circuit as having, in effect, held that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his taxes has a rico claim?
right, and that was rejected by this court in chandris. so i   i think there's a problem here.
i mean, there   there was not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of time expired before the application was made. why would that count as some extraordinary circumstance? why shouldn't the petitioner be stuck with the time bar? i don't see how this fits even under your proposed rule.
well, has the eleventh circuit or did the old fifth circuit ever apply this doctrine in any area outside of admiralty?
and then after some, i think, 2 years  
he does that. he does that.
thank you, mr. jones. mr. savrin, you have four minutes remaining.
well, what we said was your claims are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are required by federal law to use.
  state that says, "it's pending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file anything for 3 years, your appeal." now, i haven't heard that fully briefed and so forth, so i hesitate to express a final conclusion on it. but it  
does it make a difference on the   the   does the categorization make a difference on the relevant time of the inquiry for the 15 employees? you have 16 employees when the discrimination takes place. by the time the lawsuit is filed, you've only got 14. does it matter whether that's called jurisdiction or going to the merits?
no, your honor
the testimony  
it could be.
i know you do believe that, but i want to know why in terms of the purposes of not the hearsay  
but then i think the argument  
well, that's true. that's true. but the provision you're arguing that you come under does talk about a complaint.
  under 1326, clearly on the   on   by reference to whether someone was convicted of a state felony, without any   without any general federal minimum. official
the federal rule provides that the operating   the state chartered operating subs are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the parent national bank. and there is no authority from congress given to the occ that kind of rule. the occ only has the authority that congress gives it, either through a preemptive statute or through the dell designation of preemptive authority; and congress has not given them that kind of power.
sure. i think this court in casey addressed that consideration. and casey was essentially this case, a pre-enforcement challenge brought to the adequacy of the medical emergency exception. and this court held that if the law prohibited an immediate abortion for some of the very same conditions we outline here, it would have been unconstitutional.
we're not bound by that concession. if that's a jurisdictional question, doesn't matter whether the government conceded it or not, does it?
not  
and so when you get into this evidence of child abuse, i mean, how are we supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to outgrow it? do we make that determination in every case based on the particular evidence and the particular arguments that counsel made?
all right, in this case, $167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as i understand it. that if the time comes to assert a right of indemnification, you can assert a right of indemnification and we can oppose it. if we are going to construe the bankruptcy law to provide a law like this, then maybe there is something wrong in the, in the construction of the bankruptcy law.
involuntary. under  
your honor, beginning with the railway labor act case and continuing up through the public school teacher cases, abood and hudson, this court has recognized that compelling employees to pay fees must be balanced against the need to protect them from  
my understanding is that 22 nothing was done in response to that. is that correct?
thank you, mr. kneedler. the case is submitted.
but those doctrines that you're talking about would be overridden on the hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about. in other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply with the law. so they're going to deliberately violate the law. well, if they're deliberately violating the law, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very much.
it may   there may be some storage involved, there may be other occasions. but the fact is that the distributor files a monthly report describing how much fuel is   it receives.
well, justice souter, i   i don't have any qualms with the application of claim preclusion here. the   the third circuit, though, was being   was being sensitive to the interests of the state courts, as well as sensitive to the fact that it had another jurisdictional issue in front of it, which was subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia. and i'm   i'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have reached the same result if res judicata had been before it. but the   the fact is that rooker-feldman is there and, again, as   as with my response to justice ginsburg earlier, your   your question would effectively rub out any need for even rooker and feldman themselves.
  kind of causal  
i can give you a rough estimate. there are   there are 700   about 700 slip-and-fall cases a year, but the vast, vast majority of those are slipping in a building on, you know, a slippery floor, which we concede liability for. probably, you know   less than a dozen, around ten or so a year, thus far. but  
it seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a new jersey wholesaler.
the application for the permit does not automatically equate to a request to discharge. the fill of a wetland does not automatically discharge into the ditch.
i think we understand your position. thank you. mr. kneedler, you have about three   three or four minutes.
and i don't believe that's the case, justice scalia.
but the grievance procedure covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that when you go to the grievance procedure, you're not necessarily entitled to findings and   and written conclusions, et cetera. but there's a reason for that. the reason for that is that these things can be very, very minor. so now you're saying that just because of   the grievance procedure doesn't entitle you necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go into court. but the only reason you don't get those findings is because we know, going in, that they're so minor. so now the most minor things go to court. that seems very anomalous.
i'm going to refer you to the specific pages. they first referenced clay soils on page 93. these are the same clay soils that the state administrative law judge, after much hearing on the record, found were impermeable to prevent groundwater and surface water discharge. then at page 97 of the appendix, the respondent finds that due to site conditions   i will quote   this wetland has been obstructed from receiving runoff from surrounding area and from circulation by flooding into the drain. end of quote. then referring to page 99 of the same appendix, i quote. the parcel is not currently a part of the s-o drain watershed, being the sutherland-oemig watershed. then referring to page 100 where they comment on navigation, they state, no impact on navigation. and then finally at page 106 of the appendix, the features on this site   and again i quote   presently isolate the wetland from the s-o drain and receiving waters. so it receives none and it gives none. they used the term in their report isolated. there is no finding anywhere to the contrary in any reports issued, or thereafter at the public hearing that was conducted by the respondent, that there is any connection. in fact, the sixth circuit noted there was no connection.
but do you  
well, it's not really the same act. it's the same act, in that they used the mail, and there was a consequence to the mail, but the creation of a hazard or   through some kind of careless act, whether it be the postal employee or whether it be a person that would raise 2680(c) from the customs exception, whether   or an irs agent or a private person  
  you are responsible, but he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of the intermediate entities that own, or manage directly, the building.
why would you feel  
there is no provision in the statute, justice scalia, for this court to second-guess foreign-policy determinations that are made  
well, in this case, the judge told the defendant i've got a solution to this. here's my form.
but why should that  
now is that   is it possible? or is that out of the question in this case?
which new york state paid, and that's the end of it.
i   i think that's right. i'd also like to address, just very briefly, the asarco question. the language that the court used in there we don't necessarily think was loose or inappropriate, justice ginsburg, and the reason was the court cites at that point an amicus brief by the united states and it cites a particular footnote. and what that footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining company in that case could file a federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not necessary. but by challenging the invalidation itself, that   that looks more like a direct challenge to the state court judgment. it's not simply a relitigation. so that behind the court's language there   and of course, it was really just addressing standing. it was not directly addressing rooker-feldman. but the u.s.'s suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the state court judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like appellate review, more likely to infringe upon rooker feldman-type interests. in the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines adequately cover all of this, that it is not true  
that's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case. you're punishing him for the harm to be this time, and you can   just as in a criminal case, why can't you in both cases take into account that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?
because? and what's your strongest argument that it wouldn't?
but 225-  
so i guess if he had, he should have said fed or u.s. or whatever it is so that i'll know.
now   you heard what i said.
what else?
you had the opportunity to challenge those findings under the roberts regime in state court?
and in giving your arguments toward the safety benefits of the d&x, i couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery situation.
you can't say.
you're not saying   now you're using different tests. your test is "substantial." all right, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel to mr. carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the xerox machine? are you sure, if you were the counsel to the creator of the vcr, that you could recommend, given the use, copying movies, that we should ever have a vcr? are you sure that you could recommend to the ipod inventor that he could go ahead and have an ipod, or, for that matter, gutenberg, the press? i mean, you see the problem.
under that, under that approach, when a u.s. marshal executes a search and there's a fourth amendment claim that the search is illegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation of the marshals service on an as-applied basis.
  personal injury. it's not a  
first amendment problem  
yes.
well, i think that the, the   that would probably be a defect in removal procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even if it is  
your honor, the advantage is that wachovia bank insulates itself from liability, because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts of the subsidiary corporation.
  petition on that.
yes, your honor.
the distinction, justice souter, that i believe, from your analogy, is that the kansas legislature has said they do know, and that death is appropriate once a defendant has been found guilty of capital murder, in a very narrow definition. and then, once the  
yes, they had the exact same language in article 1. the structure of the treaties were identical. the other three tribes of the iroquois were not of concern to new york state in 1788 because the mohawks had mostly removed to canada, the tuscaroras had no land of their own and the senecas were in the portion of new york state where massachusetts had the preemption right. so if you look at what is happening back in 1788 and early 1789, new york state is setting up a state treaty with the oneidas and keeping jurisdiction over those lands. now, to go back to what you asked earlier, justice scalia, no question that if in that context, the federal government then passed a statute that says, as it may, the oneidas can't sell this land without federal approval. that's a violation of the nonintercourse act, but it doesn't change the fundamental nature of the land as being under state jurisdiction, and has been under state jurisdiction since 1788.
no?
not at all, your honor.
  to the district  
and so i   i don't know how   what the   there won't be evidence. how can we get evidence on such a thing?
the kansas supreme court construed it to mean that a tie goes to the   to the state.
  in  
and, at that point, we don't have any way of knowing, i take it, whether the penalty should be life or death.
it was a roadblock which produced a collision, a physical impact between vehicles. and that was the   that was the distinction which justice scalia latched onto in that case, and said that the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in brower was no different than the burglar fleeing by foot in garner. either one of them  
  the strength of the federal interest is important, justice kennedy, but as merrell dow pointed out, the federal interest is not deemed to be substantial enough, or the federal question at stake in the case is not deemed to be sufficiently substantial unless congress has created a federal private right of action for violation of the particular statute that is being pled.
once a tax is collected, once the government actually has money in its hands, and if there's a scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a tax and   that would be a scheme to deprive a government body of money. but a scheme to merely evade paying a tax is not something that falls within the statute, separate and apart from the revenue rule. but the revenue rule   as a result of the revenue rule, it is also the case that no state court would have recognized any property interest in a foreign sovereign, even if it had reached the point of a judgment. and so it works in both ways. the  
that's not bad.
what she testified to makes no 19 sense.
for any  
was that denied?
as it is in nine other circuits.
right. i would say that that, ultimately, is for this court. then, if that's so, how can he agree with the   to confer jurisdiction on the world court, which would do the same thing?
yes. i think the easiest way to explain our position on that is that what has been articulated here is that a retroactive   a rule made retroactive by this court would be applicable to mr. bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been somehow procedurally defaulted along the way. in other words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was discussed by both the state and the government of the other sections of the statute which clearly recognize, as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the legislation did, that you still have the power to make rules retroactive, but the only way that mr. bockting would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if the state court had never ruled on the merits of his claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that meant that he was defaulted on the claim. so instead of mr. bockting, who has raised this question of being able to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial, he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him. if instead he now, he goes back later and the court says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the door is slammed on you, according to the state now there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's why that section of the statute would permit the retroactive rule to apply. 2254(d)(1), while it has the language clearly established, and the court asked some questions about that, i think it must be remembered that when that statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in state court   or in federal court, on federal habeas. and so at the time that the petitioner is in federal court, then the rule has been clearly established. the 2254(d)  
you said this court has repeatedly said. so what  
well  
leaving aside the inducement.
does your argument  
within the   within the public records proceeding, it was referenced that it would be the same as   as sims. florida department of corrections  
your honor, my answer to that question would be that that's always going to be the case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this high rate of speed.
i don't believe so, justice ginsburg. i think that they were never admonished not to wear them, but that the original ruling of the trial judge stood as far as the wearing of the buttons was concerned.
okay.
counsel, is there anything in the record to alert us to the race of the prosecutor?
so, he's better off on parole than   well, at least no worse off on parole than he would be when he was in prison.
of course, that   there would still remain   whether you mooted the case, or whether we vacated and then it was left to the oregon supreme court whether to let this evidence in   there would still remain the question of what kind of an instruction the jury can be given regarding the consideration of this evidence for purposes not of determining whether a guilty person should not be given the death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of considering whether the guilt is clear enough. i mean, that's   that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?
the court granted  
okay. so then why wouldn't the result of your position be that every person who is denied state post-conviction relief is going to file a cert position to get the additional time?
it has both in this context. it is, i think, first and foremost, an objective component, because there is   this is a civil case. it's not purely subjective. and that objective component is very important because that is what makes the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk. there has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.
it probably would, but i think it's interesting that the version of 924(c) that was in effect prior to 1988 said exactly that. it said "felony violation of federal law." official
i   i want to make it tough so that i   i will not be tempted to withdraw. is that the motivation?
your friend will tell us what he said.
you can only recover  
well, why   it's   why is that a lesser remedy? it's just different. i mean, remittitur is a lesser remedy, too, but you don't say, "well, if you've made a motion for a new trial, and then that falls by the wayside, you   the court can do remittitur." the approach seems to be, "something's wrong here, and we have to do something, so what is it that we can do?" and you look around, "well, maybe we can give them a new trial, or maybe we can have a remittitur." but there are different motions for all these different things, and, if they haven't been made, they seem to be off the board.
we believe at the very least she should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive holding of a sign because it said something you disagreed with.
you're talking about on the basis that he filed before the act?
  suppose you had a case of two volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial period of time, one dealer   we'll call that dealer the "favored dealer"   consistently gets higher concessions, and the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case, consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions. so, we don't have a picture of what you call "mix and match," but two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on sales or making sales at a very low profit. that, too, would be out of robinson-patman, if i understand your view of the statute.
you'd still have to vacate the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of it.
  it held it invalid under california law  
well, my answer to that, justice scalia, is that this court has never said that an appeal of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is expired. and in cases like lane v. williams and spencer v. kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and, official therefore, the court had to look for collateral consequences of the now-expired sentence. here, in consequence   in contrast, mr. toledo-flores is still under the sentence, which is a direct consequence  
congress wanted to substitute a federal judgment for the judgment of the states where it said so. and the reason you know that is because that is what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other things are either neutral or negative. don't interfere with the state unless you have to.
all of those things are okay, right, except the race one.
  to the   and   and the related usually means that the acquisition of the evidence was the product of the violation. it was caused by the violation. and   and for that reason, we keep it out. and here, it's   it's hard to say that this was caused by the fact that they   that they entered in a few seconds too soon. so he would have answered the door and they would have seen the stuff.
well, the ninth circuit remanded for specific reasons on repleading, which your honor has articulated, and those would have occurred. the other issues relating to loss raise questions concerning whether some of the   the claims might be time barred and whether or not those claims could be stated. so that would have raised a different issue. in addition, throughout the pleadings of this case   we're now on the third complaint   the   the plaintiffs have not raised that issue and have not sought to plead causation consistent with the   our view of the world.
yes. i am not, i am not sure that it's correct that in all of those municipalities you hypothesize that they are actually pairing their provision of local  
where is that advice contained, that you say was given to  
but it's possible you could argue, looking at the record, that the judge should have tried it   should have excluded it on a different basis. he should have excluded it on the basis of the interests of justice, et cetera required. so what the judge said, just to make it clear, is i'm not even thinking about this different basis, though i might. i'm doing it just because he waived it. and now you're telling me, i take it, he can't waive it, but nonetheless, the error is harmless because he waived it, or something like that.
justice ginsburg, that's easily as effective as the   as youth was in graham and johnson. youth is evidence that   i mean, we don't know how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but certainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the circumstances in that case. and so i don't see any difference between youth and burnout in this context. we are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't know exactly what that amount of time is, but it's certainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating effect to it under that question.
based upon the facts that we had   and he didn't know this individual. he had no premeditated intent to kill him.
well, first off, until  
two things. one is they can look for the gary jones that has some tie to the bryan street address, and certainly  
and the ninth circuit properly found that the conclusion was both unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, and it's because none of these reasons, when we look at the totality   what i'm trying to say is  
  last week showing that the review process under these regulations actually works. it's been working for 15 years. and as we explain in our brief, more than 9,000 people have been granted parole here.
but it didn't  
well, maybe they   assume 16 that's all true. they thought they knew everything  
i would submit that that sentiment is obvious to the jury, that a juror  
  under section  
well   and it's interesting. the several hundred pages they talk about, there are three iq tests that he had gotten. when he was 7 years old he tested at 87; when he was 10 years old he tested at 87; when he was 13 he tested at 78. they   and they introduced all three. these were the school records. there weren't competing experts. it's interesting in closing arguments  
if   if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a court of claims decision, the blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.
  for the special law enforcement  
i   i believe what he was addressing was language within a particular statute, meaning a lesser-included offense of   of murder or how you styled it, whether it be depraved heart murder or   or felony murder, first degree murder.
there are a number of cases in this court that say what a prosecutor can't say, guilt phase. all of them happen to be guilt phase, i guess. you can't, you know, vouch. you can't use too much emotion. you have to focus on what the defendant did, not on what somebody else did. i mean, there are a number of things. now, do those   is it fair or not fair to say that those precedents apply in the capital sentencing phase, too?
and that's why you're here.
but the   the judge can't make that finding if the witness doesn't testify, can he?
suppose you were to lose, you would still have that claim, i take it?
  of the  
but that doesn't matter to your analysis. it's the one post, right? i mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on either side, would   the flows, in   under your view, suddenly becomes a discharge.
well, you're   i'm asking you to be the finder of fact for me. this is the officer's explanation. this is the factual   set of factual premises on which he acts. has he violated the arbitrary and capricious limitation?
the preclusion doctrine  
mr. frederick, i understand how your arguments work under section 1962(c), but how   how do they work under 1962(a)? it seems that that gets around many of the causation and reliance arguments that you make.
in the afternoon he either was or he wasn't.
okay, and you agree with that?
i think that's a fair point, justice ginsburg. we're operating in something of a disadvantage, because we haven't seen the entirety of the record. based on the record that i've seen, i think there's a close case, unless perhaps once this court clarifies the legal standard, respondents put on additional evidence. i think this is a close case, where you actually could grant summary judgment in favor of the petitioners. but certainly we have no objection to having a trial on the sony issue in this case. what we object to is the ninth circuit rule, which, in every case, is going to obviate the need for a trial, based on a showing that there are such things as public-domain works.
what's the best authority you have for that proposition?
thank you, ms. lee. mr. kneedler.
your honor, i think there's a couple of problems with that. i mean, first of all, these were contracts where domino's had rights under these contracts as well, and if it had sued mr. mcdonald under the terms of the contract for failing to perform, he would have rightly said, that's not my contract. and i don't think that we can think that congress intended this court to simply disregard those principles that have always governed where you   if you take the benefits of avoiding liability, you can't turn around and say, well, now that it's time to recover against domino's, it is my contract. that's not the way the law works. he can't disown the   the force of the law when he's taken the benefits of the law. and now, the burden here is really a moderate one. it's one that says that the recovery that is owed will come through the corporate entity. he will get whatever his share of that is through the   the corporate processes, and he won't be able to have an independent claim for emotional distress. but  
run it up the flagpole, see if  
  and had enough money  
see, i don't   i don't understand. didn't you have an opportunity to develop the record? i mean, this was  
it's not of dispositive significance, justice souter.
do we have an example of issue letters anywhere? that's not in the materials either, is it? in the  
when you say they   they contemplate it, how do they express that contemplation? i mean, are   are there magic words that diplomats understand or   or what?
well  
if the private mine inspector had the   assumed the same duties, so it's under like circumstances, that the federal mine inspector had here, which was to inspect the mine in its entirety four times per year and to respond to all safety-related complaints and determine whether they present imminent hazards, and to remove the miners from the area   if those are the characteristics of the private individual under like circumstances, then i concede that would be a better predictor of state   and if we knew what arizona would decide in that context, i  
well, but you're suggesting that they kind of  
oh, yes, your honor. in this   in this case, i   there is certainly no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt precluded, because, as was previously discussed, first there was this additional instruction that supplemented the other instructions in this case that made it very clear that the aggravating factors, the various factors listed in the standard instruction a through g, that those were the   they could only rely on those two for aggravating factors, but their understanding of mitigating factors was not limited. in fact, they were expressly told that the previous factors were merely examples.
i think the standard is different than that, under rule 11.
well, to be quite   to expose my thinking on it, i found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 and 1261. is that what   the first part of that is   it says what you said. i have no doubt. it says just what you said. but then you get over to the part, the discussion of booker, and when they start talking about booker, they seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what booker says. now, if they are adopting what booker says, that means, and that's why i used my example, that i guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable, to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so, isn't right for my circumstance. and therefore, i don't adopt it. and that would be reviewed for reasonableness, his decision not to follow it. and similarly, we have cases, for example, where they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in order   and then makes them concurrent. or you could have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy, and the jury found the conspiracy. it is a characterization of a conspiracy, it is very sophisticated. and i thought, well, maybe all three of those are reasons for going up in california. and i read those pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is i'm not sure.
it did, your honor, and again the district court never came out with any specifics regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion that it felt that the guideline range was not inappropriate.
do we have a standard  
right, but the  
what do i do it in a state where there is a plausible close question of whether or not the successive petition is barred in the state court? and i interrupted justice breyer, but i   i think it's along the same line.
i'm not sure that it has anything to do, directly, with the theory of sovereign immunity, but  
thank you mr. stewart.
well, it rules the world unless the world does not want to use the united states ports as ports of call.
what   what did the judge   what did judge say? your brother said the judge said, no, i won't hear this.
yes, justice o'connor, it does.
no, because merrell dow did not involve a substantial question of federal law, and that was part of the test that i announced. and the difference between this case and merrell dow is twofold. first, this case falls within the hopkins line of cases, and second, this   the role of federal law in merrell dow is completely different than it was in this case and in the hopkins line of cases. what was going on in merrell dow is that the state adopted a federal standard as presumptive evidence of state law negligence, and when a state adopts a federal standard into its own state law standard, the   the action remains one that is fundamentally state law in character. so the federal question in the case is not regarded as substantial. but here, the situation is entirely different.
mr. farr, i'm not sure i followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).
we didn't characterize it as an exhaustion argument. that is, the district court alluded to the petitioner's failure to exhaust in dismissing the suit. however, we   this is not a case in which we have, up to this point, litigated the merits of the fourth amendment dispute and then switched to a threshold objection to adjudication. we've always argued that the suit was barred by the csra scheme, and we've always pointed out that the petitioner did not take advantage of the administrative remedies that were available to him. really, the only change in our position is that we have been in the   in this court have been willing to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case where someone in petitioner's position did make   take full advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full advantage of the administrative processes, that judicial review would be available.
do you   do you dispute what   what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?
what's the difference between what justice scalia was just saying? you can't come into federal court unless you have at least $200,000 damages. now, you might have been just as much hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional. so here you can't get into federal court unless you have a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning. now, you might have a good claim, but we're not going to let you come into federal court. we only want those people who are really strong, just as we only want those people who are really suffering.
  to pay these contract obligations.
that may well be a wise course of action   action, justice ginsburg. i should point out that mr. casey, when he filed the response to the bulger cert petition, brought this court's attention to the fact that this underlying litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called tesmer v. granholm. and so he brought to this court's attention that we had already prevailed in federal district court in tesmer v. granholm as a suggestion as to why this court did not need to grant cert in the bulger case, and so this court did not grant cert. i don't know, of course   i don't know why this court did not grant cert in bulger.
should a challenge to that have been brought in the d.c. circuit at that time, or would you have argued that's too late?
well, but  
i would   i would not describe "exhaustion" that way. i would   i would describe a failure to file within the prescribed time, not as an exhaustion of remedies, but as a failure to exhaust remedies. i mean, i guess i'm having a terminological problem in this case, as i did in the previous case.
i think it's very important to realize that both rule 81 of the federal rules of civil procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure, which the state would have us use as a constraint, really are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to be a functional approach. both of those rules tell us that the rules apply to the extent that they're compatible, and so that's certainly not a categorical approach. that is a functional approach.
mr. long. mr. long, you represent the respondent in the second case. is that right?
the case is submitted.
what other areas would we be messing up by finding for you? i mean, here, you know, if we don't find that this administrative action is covered by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of limitations. but there may   there are other   may be official other areas covered by this text   namely, a suit by the united states   founded upon any contract expressly or implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a statute of limitations.
2 years after the district judge made his ruling in this particular case. and it   it was in this particular case 2 years. it could be 10 years. it could be 15 years, and that's the problem that we see is that if  
it doesn't refer to antitrust cases. those were references to state law remedies that congress later contracted with the  
your honor, i'm trying to recall that amicus brief. i believe that   was that an argument, i believe, about the application of section 83 of the tax code when you have a transaction  
see, i think there may be a difference there, because i think the other side thinks that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is part of what the fda looks at. apparently, the government takes that position, as narrowly as i could determine. but you reject that, as well.
well, it also would protect the government when there is a   either a personal injury or some kind of loss, a personal injury or an economic loss that arises from the damage or delay to the mail. you know, i think i brought up the example of the medication or if   if you had a check or a coupon bond that was destroyed. there would  
if a   if a appeal or an application to the michigan court of appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason. but for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the michigan court of appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.
okay, 21a, good.
one, your honor, the judge admonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were that of an advocate, and that  
thank you, mr. fisher. mr. collins.
so, basically, the test   the pickering balancing is the same in this situation as it is in, let's say, the givhan situation.
and a good thing too. (laughter.)
why did they use the word "until," instead of the word "unless"?
yes.
how many states have an instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances of the crime?
are you saying  
with all respect, your honor, i think that the way that it makes sense is that the   you get the threshold issue of getting through the limitation, as this court described it in southland on pages 10 and 11, of the limitation on the enforceability of arbitration clauses of is it in a contract in the first place. that is the   what the first part is talking about. then separately the court   the   the congress had intended only a limited intrusion into state law, as this court said in the volt case where it said that this   that there was not   this is not the national bank act. there was no field preemption. there was no express preemption. there was only conflict preemption. and in the allied-bruce case, what justice breyer's opinion for the court said was we recognize that state law will play an important role for certain contract defenses after the contract has first been found to be enforceable. i think that if   if this jurisdictional idea   the way you get into the arbitration act, what triggers that the arbitration act exists   and this is pretty much the language that's used at the   in the bottom of 10 and top of 11 of southland   is that you have an arbitration agreement that's enforceable. then there is a but in which congress left out an alternative where you have specific challenges to how the arbitration clause is formed. i think that that's a very workable system, but that's also the way congress drafted the statute.
  again, can you advise us of their practice or lower-court opinions addressing that issue?
what are we supposed to do, to return to justice scalia's question, with the fact that this appears   i counted about 12 cases, i mean, where it implicitly or explicitly appears, something like it. are we supposed to just, oh, say all those cases were wrong and   what are we supposed to do about that?
what is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all ira plans before people are 59 and a half?
do we know   do we have the grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact, evidence was put before the grand jury that false identifications were presented at the border?
and that's the area of focus.
but, your honor, the  
  does it raise a reasonable possibility of innocence, not   not that it's the most likely or the only possibility from that evidence. and i think if you look at the south carolina supreme court's opinion carefully, in light of the   the supreme court's decisions in gregory and gay, you see that in fact what the court was doing was simply saying this case is like gay. there's strong evidence. we're going to look at the evidence on both sides. and there's a   there is certainly language in the opinion that makes it sound like an automatic or categorical rule, but in fact, they did go on to look at the defendant's evidence.
well   well, there really   there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, i mean, i   i think we should just proceed on   on some other basis for this argument. we have other questions to discuss.
yes, but those can be removed, your honor.
  the taxation?
that's what the government believes, your honor. it's also   the licensee also does not need to breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case or controversy. the licensee is currently paying royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it believes it would be entitled to have back if it should prevail on its interpretation of the   of the patent and the licensing agreement. it doesn't have to make that injury more severe by breaching. that's clear from this court's decision in altvater. in altvater, royalties were being demanded and royalties were being paid, but, nevertheless, this court held  
i know that, but   but   and you do it with a penalty. we agree about the facts.
so you're reporting not merely the   the tort of tortious interference, but some general, broader concept of tort law as being subsumed with   under 1981. aren't you?
what about a   a rule requiring good faith or reasonable argument in death cases? in all the other cases, there's no incentive to do this endless filing, and in death cases, there is. so in those death cases, we would insist that it is not properly filed if it's out of time unless the prisoner in good faith and with a plausible argument, a reasonable argument thought it was in time.
one of the problems with the district court exercising equitable discretion without a close review by the federal circuit is just the thing that the federal circuit was created to handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among district judges. i don't know that it's only in marshall, texas that you have a tilt in one direction or in the other. so the federal circuit is put there not to say that the district judges have no discretion, but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't have wide disparities, which you very well might have if you just say discretion to the district judges and very light review on appeal.
it   it depends on if there's a new   if   if there has not been a new triggering date, other than the finality for the aedpa date, then you will be out of time for aedpa.
and then you say the civil action has to give   be diverse as to all claims.
yes.
in other words, you say   you say the offenses are killing somebody with or without the intent to do so  
it may be admissible evidence but depending on the facts and circumstances  
if that means the petitioner was wrong, doesn't it also mean that judge giles is wrong, and if judge giles can't figure it out, isn't there a pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get equitable tolling?
are there cases that   that we've issued from this court that address what happens in a case like this where the economic circumstances and many other circumstances of the two latino populations are very different? the border hispanics and the hispanics in austin have very   very little in common other than   than the latino background. are there   are there cases that address whether or not these populations can be combined in   in order to satisfy the   the voting rights act requirements?
well, justice scalia, in fact, this court has recognized that under the sixth amendment, as applied to the federal government, even before the sixth amendment was made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment, that it did guarantee the right to appointed counsel if the defendant  
so what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted? his action accrued but then it didn't accrue?
we're saying that the river flows continuously down. it changes at various points as it goes down a river. as it goes through rapids, a river changes. the nature of a river changes as it goes over rapids. as it comes  
what's the difference?
well, one of the reasons i'm curious is that i believe the pecos master is an engineer. he's not a lawyer.
thank you, counsel. mr. cahill.
but were any of those determinations made here?
absolutely, but the proceedings before a grand jury are secret. we never know what happened inside a grand jury. it's a closed door proceeding. it is an independent body. it is not subject to any appeals or reviews by the trial judge. the only thing that we know what happened behind those closed doors was the document that emerges, which is the indictment which becomes public knowledge. nothing else is known about what happened in that jury room. now, i'll take a guess as to what happened. the government told the grand jury that the overt act requirement was not necessary, or perhaps, i'll take another guess, they stated to the grand jury what they stated to the district judge, that the indictment does in fact state the overt act when plainly it doesn't.
so, in effect, they didn't   the court didn't consider this argument in smith.
of course, when you have a physical invasion of property and a inverse condemnation is tantamount to a physical invasion, then we've built up some doctrine in order to protect the concept of physical invasion so that that can't be avoided. perhaps that's not applicable to a   to an economic regulation.
there is.
mr. mellen, i've been looking at dr. kiefer's testimony. is this what you're referring to: "there was remarkable agreement among every group in jefferson county public schools about how desirable having diversity in the schools was"?
she conducted some   some  
you don't know about it, but the market knows about it. that's   that's why the stock has gone down.
well, that's what the court would determine. and presumably in a case like that, the court would be able to dispose of it quickly and  
i thought carden was about: in a partnership, does every partner's citizenship count?
well   i   i guess, in   in going beyond the eleventh amendment, we were appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that existed at the time of the framing.
can we get back to what the case is about. you think the law was so clearly established when this happened that the principal, that the instant that the banner was unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is coming, should have said oh, i remember under tinker i can only take the sign down if it's disruptive. but then under frazier i can do something if it interferes with the basic mission, and under kuhlmeier i've got this other thing. so she should have known at that point that she could not take the banner down, and it was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own pocket because of it.
there  
your honor, while background administrative law principles provide epa at least some room to move, we think it's important that epa say that. if they   it's a very different opinion if they say, we are not going to regular here because we just don't want to spend the resources on this problem and we want to look elsewhere. if they want to say that, they can say that and then, if at all, there'd be a narrow arbitrary and capricious challenge on that. but the point is here they relied on the impermissible consideration that they simply disagreed with the policy behind the statute.
it's going to attract claims  
well, but then you're giving away the riggins argument, which is that this somehow affects the psyche of the defendant and he can't fully participate, et cetera, which i thought was your argument.
but it denies the right subject to being a damage remedy that's available.
separately.
do you know what ferc's position is  
the   the question of whether it was timely or not is not actually determined until the end of the litigation.
what happens on remand in this very case based on your theory? you are not adopting the district judge's position that this case should be dismissed outright.
maybe this is not a fair   how likely is it, given our determination in dabit about how congress intended to treat fraud claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any better?
yes, because that's more than nothing, and the rule in form 9 contains nothing.
i would say that the model penal code is consistent with the majority view. on this question of intent to steal, as we set forth in our brief, 42 states hold what we say the law is, that an intent to steal   a theft offense requires a mens rea more than taking with an intent to give back.
okay.
  applied a particular standard. and certainly it had to have been. didn't the court of appeals have a particular standard as to what constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the   by the safe harbor exemption? it must have had. i mean, how could you   how could you rule on the question before you unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe harbor consists of and what is beyond it?
maybe we're getting ripped off.
that's what i thought.
well, but we don't give broad construction to waivers of sovereign immunity.
that's correct, your honor, but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here, and i think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind anyway to determine that the state court in reading graham and johnson could unreasonably determine that that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said, you have a reasonable doubt about this man's dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be dangerous in the future.
may i ask sort of a broad 15 question? am i correct in assuming that this really isn't 16 the most important case we ever heard because it only 17 affects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect 18 the basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's 19 clear that the   from both the text of the statute and 20 whatever we know about the legislative history, that it's 21 a problem congress never even thought about?
but the president's order is, by its term, confined to the 51 mexican nationals. medellin's theory is not. medellin's theory is not even confined to those on death row; but, rather, would potentially extend to the thousands of foreign nationals  
did you say '84 or '94? i couldn't  
okay.
your honor, in this case they could not amend their complaint because the federal jurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we removed. and at the time of removal, it was clearly precluded by slusa. and the court's cases are very clear that a plaintiff may not amend. for example, you can't lower the amount in controversy below $75,000 to get back to state court. at the time of removal, the federal court both had jurisdiction over this case and it was clearly precluded under slusa.
that is the issue in these cases  
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
which is the very issue your   your petition presents us with.
and that's what   he did   that was correct.
what does the new policy say about this?
yes, that's true.
i thought   i thought   i thought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely vulnerable   i thought that was the point you were making  
he is covered. well, then why isn't the croupier covered?
what would you think would be necessary, what would be the least change california would have to make to bring its system into compliance with our decisions?
thank you, mr. kellogg. mr. barnett.
but it involved the test for predatory pricing, your honor, under robinson-patman. but the court said its test was perfectly applicable to section 2. and the lower courts have certainly applied that test in just that way in section 2 cases. and if the rule would be that even in the predatory selling situation intent can override the price-cost and the recoupment requirements, then you're in a situation where there's no ability for business people to know in advance when low prices are justified. all we think is that there should be symmetry. if the court has no further questions i'll reserve the balance of my time.
thank you. thank you, counsel. mr. tager you have three minutes remaining.
let   let me start with   i go back to the diana case because i think the way the court approached the question in the diana case is the way this court should approach it because it dealt with the same kind of defense, necessity. and what it wanted   it said this is a defense where there is a there is a big danger that this can be manufactured in a way that it is difficult to disprove, and we are going to establish a regime that doesn't invite manufactured claims and that doesn't make it difficult for the government to disprove something beyond a reasonable doubt. we have a choice here, and that's not the regime we want to establish. we want to establish a regime that makes it more unlikely that manufactured claims are going to come forward and that make it   makes it more unlikely that if such claims do come forward, the government isn't going to be able   unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt, compromising the entire statutory scheme.
well, first of all, there have   there was no dispute whatsoever that these types of cases could be brought in federal court in 1998.
well, i thought   i thought you conceded that a state offense could constitute illicit trafficking  
i understand. i'm just wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve that kind of dispute? should that be a dispute that remains open throughout the appellate process/ there's a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.
so kansas does not put the burden on the defendant.
but you see   yes. i'm   i'm not disagreeing with you. i'm saying i read their new policy, now having gotten to it the third time through all this detail, and it seems to me that they do give a notice, and justice o'connor just pointed out where there's a place for reasons. and as i read what happens after the committee decides, it says, it shall make a decision   a recommendation accordingly   according to this very long, detailed form.
and why would that be bad?
and his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure. that is what you say is his direct knowledge.
i think your vitamin a example is an excellent example of a non-preempted claim. if a manufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts clorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the jury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would not have used clorox. he would have used the pesticide. if the argument, on the other hand, is clorox was fine. i don't have a problem with clorox, i just wish i would have been given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff would frame his complaint. we think it's critical that our theory is if the plaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily   necessarily predicated on a requirement that the manufacturer used a label different than the epa-approved label the federal law required it use  
which was it? just   what was the case you just mentioned?
you take the position that in fact there was no error in scoring.
and then it releases it again as it passes by the wheel.
the   the   the nonmember employees certainly have a first amendment right not to be compelled to finance, help finance political, ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their objection. and that right is fully protected independently of 760 by the hudson process, and as the washington supreme court held, when there is the availability of a ready means for opting out of that participation in, in financing those causes, there is no compelled speech. and this is what the, what the first amendment gives to the nonmember fee payers.
but the provision doesn't read simply that state laws defining benefits shall be preempted. it reads state laws relating to the extent of coverage or the nature or provision of coverage, benefits, or payments with respect to benefits. and so it covers a broad array of things other than simply mandated benefit statutes.
why   because you mentioned, earlier, about the defect in the trial.
i don't think he   he could say, "if you would have   i would have gotten up and answered the door; and, therefore, you wouldn't have had to come in without knocking, you wouldn't have had to break the door, you wouldn't have had to scare me."
but  
i  
justice breyer's questions were pointing out, to the extent your regulation   the federal regulation of your subsidiary conflicts with the state law, that regulation is going to prevail. the question is whether or not you are immune from state regulation across the board  
well, there's   there's no   the prison officials here have an affirmative duty to protect the other inmates under the eighth amendment, and  
may i just finish, please? you argued, as i understand it, correctly, that the state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that will not be exercised   will not be replaced by federal controls; is that right? in other words, you   that they will be unregulated to a certain extent? there will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than there is under the state; is that correct?
your honor, when the tax court adopted its present procedures in 1984, it   it certainly did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. but the question is whether it violates the statute or due process for it to do what it has done. let me just   we've been spending most of our time talking about this issue of whether the tax court   the special trial judge is permitted to change his report under rule 183. that's not even one of the questions in the questions presented. the only rule 183 question in the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear error review. we submit the answer to that is no because it would violate the internal revenue code. so this   this question about whether the report permits   whether the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one of the questions presented. the courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the premise that it was permissible for the tax court judge and the trial   the special trial judge to engage in the deliberative process and for the special trial judge to revise his findings as he did  
justice breyer, i disagree respectfully.
but there was a finding that it was in the course of the rape.
yes.
well, i don't think there was any need for an, for the trial court to put landrigan on the stand having already presided over landrigan's trial and sentencing.
there is evidence of rape besides   besides the semen. the semen wasn't the only evidence of rape, was it?
justice breyer, the district judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the stuff, and i  
all right. so, that's a different issue. why doesn't it?
right. it could be something else. but i think that if you were going   it's still possible to draw the distinction based on an administrability factor, which is the way many courts have looked at it, which is you don't want to have to have the court look back to transcripts of the whole thing versus   for the whole trial, whereas if they can look at a discrete body of documents and say yes, this guy pleaded guilty to burglary of a building, that you can reach that conclusion. it's a line of administrability, not a   a line of testimony with the documents.
so   so   i'm not sure i understand what   i'm   i'm really coming to believe that this is a misunderstanding. it seems to me you're now saying that the loss does not occur when you make the purchase. it is just that that is the limit on your loss, the difference between what the stock would have cost you had the   the absence of gold been known and what you actually paid.
well, my   my first response is even the master, who ruled   who   who decided against us, did not find that the alaska case decided that, and indeed, it could not have because the court at pages 60 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso. therefore   excuse me. the main clause. therefore the court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso. it is important, though, to   to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous   and we think that it is not   alaska still prevails here because a   there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.
and the internal operations of the ship, justice kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how   everything about the ship's design  
well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? you wouldn't go that far.
thank you.
what   what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury? obviously, the burden of production is with the defendant. when can a judge say, well, you know, this   this is just too flimsy for a duress defense? i'm not going to instruct a jury on that.
i see.
thank you. and i'll address them, first and then second. as to the first point, you correctly quote the 1946 statute, but the 1948 revision was approved by congress, and it specifically says "robbery or extortion or attempts so to do," comma, "or physical violence or threats of violence." this court has said, in cases like united states versus ron pair, that commas have to be given meaning. this court, in many cases, such as fcc versus pacifica, said, "or" must be given meaning. there is  
well, justice breyer, let me answer both questions. as to the 527 issue, as i understand it, the commission has decided to proceed on case-by-case inquiries and has not tried to have a broad regulatory approach yet. now, on to the issue of electioneering communications, you're absolutely right that there is a statutory authorization to create exceptions. but the regulatory authority of the commission is limited, and it's limited in the sense that they can't approve an exception that would allow for ads that engage   that   that fairly read, engage in promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing a candidate. and what the fec has found in practice is that it's very difficult to create that kind of regulatory exception because, as this court recognized in buckley and in mcconnell, one does not want to naively underestimate the creativity of corporate spenders or political consultants. and if you create a bright line and say, all right, if you do this, that's grassroots lobbying, that's not electioneering communication, they're going to be able to drive a truck through that kind of exception  
but the language is "conspired and agreed with." and "agreed with" is pretty close to "tried to do it himself."
well, there is   there is a common element of illegality, but the distinction is that in reves, you're supposed to be providing these services, making out statements, et cetera, and you put the wrong numbers in them.
i think  
no. all he had done was taken evasive action to avoid an officer who  
look, this is what i'm   i'm interested in. it seems like michigan is unique here. why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other states have done? you just say, okay, of course, you have a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer. we'll give it to you if you're poor. but, by the way, if you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that deal unless you waive it.
it's  
in that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery. you don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you show likely, question mark, that the investigator not only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions where any reasonable person would have known that what he was doing was contrary to the constitution.
  there's no indication  
maybe arabic numerals aren't jurisdictional either.
  not every  
that's right. and if the insurance contract departed from what the state's law was, the state's law would govern it under erisa's insurance savings clause. but where you have an   and so the   the case with erisa plans is not really any different than it is outside erisa. insofar as a state under its insurance law decides to establish a make-whole doctrine or an allocation rule of some sort or a default rule, it can do that, and that can be applied to insured erisa plans. but as to uninsured erisa plans, it wouldn't be applied. and that   this court established that in its decision in fmc against holliday. this case really actually arises   it was really   it was at the intersection of two distinct doctrines that   two distinct lines of cases that both support equitable relief in a case like that. one is the   those that i've spoken about already, which is the equitable lien cases. the other is the line of subrogation cases that mr. coleman spoke about. and from the very earliest times, it was recognized in subrogation cases that that gave the insurer not only a right to advance the insured's claim, but where the insured advanced the claim and got a recovery, he holds it as a trustee for the insurer. and that was recognized from the early   from the mid-18th century cases that mr. coleman cited in his brief. it was recognized by this court in comegys   the comegys case, written by justice story in the 1820's, and it's been a consistent rule. and this is an appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan because it arises directly at the confluence of those two lines of equitable cases. thank you.
it's the magnitude by which congress has enhanced the religious right. that is, we compare what the constitution requires state prison officials to do and we say, how far has congress moved the ball.
no, i don't disagree with the fact that, in fact, that is what the supreme court said in its analysis, looking at the particular evidence in this case, that he was unable to overcome that. but i think state v. gregory didn't require that to be the ultimate threshold that it had to meet, rather that it raise a reasonable inference as to his innocence.
i suppose you'd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose.
in our view, justice ginsburg, applying the correct standard, the decision of the court of appeals in this case should be reversed. and if the case were remanded to the court of appeals for application of the standard, we certainly think that the court of appeals should come out the other way.
what is your response to the application of 1447(d)? you say that it does not apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is improper?
but if you turn the harlow standard around   i mean, you're   you're making the   the negation of the harlow standard the screening device  
we totally depend on the horizontal agreement, your honor. the case rises or falls on the horizontal agreement among underwriters to require that which the securities law  
how can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant? such a situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't have to be the sole cause. it can be just the cause in part, right?
well, i would say, in georgia, of course, state and   of course, local facilities are arms of the state in georgia. that's been the judicial holding. and so, for eleventh amendment purposes, we would consider them. but i would say the record of constitutional violations here that justifies nationwide prophylaxis is really far more extensive than the record that's been before this court in tennessee v. lane and nevada v. hibbs and touches on touches on even more states than, you know, the nationwide literacy test ban that was upheld in oregon v. mitchell. at the time this court upheld that, only 22 states had literacy tests, i think.
yes, i'm sorry, your honor. i'm flipping around. i have it here.
but aren't   aren't you   aren't you, in   in effect, equating two different things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable to the fraud? those are two different things. i understand the limit on the loss. i don't understand the   the suffering of the loss in fact.
well, i think what   first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. what they said is that there was a separate fourth amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. the jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. this is a jury verdict. the ninth circuit affirmed that. and we've argued in our brief that if the court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this   in this situation. and, you know, we've   we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. in our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.
the united states has prosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the statute and in what interests it should be served.
the state did not object to the   to the extension, your honor, because the   the mandate was of no consequence to the state in terms of the state's actual   a state court proceedings. the state did not need the mandate to go forward with its proceedings, and in fact, the state was not authorized under state law to even seek an   an execution date until the time had expired for rehearing. so  
i do think, though, that the court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judge's docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that, although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, it's out of whack with what the sentencing commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing. if there is no check on appeal, then i do think that the clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the sentencing reform act; and that does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of what the booker remedial opinion thought it was accomplishing. what the booker remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was providing an important mechanism that congress itself had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron out sentencing differences. and our submission is that inherently means some form of substantive proportionality review.
right.
because you presented it to the ninth circuit below.
yes. that's precisely what situation was with  
but you don't know how many times.
  to be limited to the 7-day period after the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the disposition of the petition for rehearing en banc or by panel or the disposition of a motion to stay the mandate. we limit that to   that interpretation to a different phase of the proceeding.
so therefore, then the question is whether throwing the hammer through the window is sufficient; is that right?
you're talking about the brief in the earlier case.
all right. so if   if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the united states intended to give that waterway to alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. i mean, it would be like   you see, if it's essential to it.
can i get you to step back just   the presumption that you began with. what   what's your strongest authority for that? the first thing you cite in your brief is a dissenting opinion of two justices.
  1983, that's  
well, maybe i wasn't following the hypothetical closely enough.
no, but isn't   i want to throw you a suggestion   isn't the answer to that problem that anything may be considered as mitigating evidence, but a mitigating factor is a conclusion that evidence has a certain significance, and not everything may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor? isn't   the problem that justice scalia raises addressed by distinguishing between evidence   consider it all   and factors, a characterization of evidence which may not necessarily be considered.
did he?
i don't think so.
it does not. and there are many circumstances in which words are used that are incidental to an action. these are not words used that are incidental to the action.
yes, that's true, your honor. what they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely disclosure of the original report.
if that was  
well, they reopened it to the extent as justice scalia has indicated, but they now take a different view of the validity of the state statute.
i think it's contrary to  
were you asking why focus  
well, is that correct? i thought in most states, there had to be a statute that authorizes a non-knock warrant.
under your definition, lunch is lunch, and so there would never be   there couldn't be  
may i ask you, when   now that we're getting into money, one of the things that the sentencing court had to do was to find out how much of a loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes would be due under canadian law. and did that increase the sentence? did the   did the sentence vary with the amount of taxes that they   we found due?
it's common, when you have a chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere. it's common, and in harris, it ended once they left the home and now they're over in the station.
that is correct.
are there any dissents in any of those cases?
do you take the view that merrell dow somehow just silently overruled about five cases dealing with quiet title actions?
i, i don't think so, your honor. i think what is distinct about the bivens claim here is first bivens and just compensation clause claims are fundamentally incompatible. and that in bivens, its damages are nothing. here the constitutional right actually explicitly provides a remedy, just compensation. secondly, just compensation claims are claims against the government.
if the statute didn't provide that a chapter 13 plan could be reconverted to a chapter 7, would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that?
well, you   you skipped a   a phrase. it says when the attorney general is of the opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing more, the individual shall return or be returned to the custody from which he began. and their argument is that custody is different in these cases.
well, and it's a much more  
let me try to give a couple of examples from different situations to make my point that there is a difference.
i don't think 106(b) applies with respect to the preference claims, your honor.
is   may   may i just follow up on that question? at the administrative level, cannot these state law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration? in other words, your argument was these things are bound up with state law issues and the best place to have them resolved is   is in a state forum. they can be resolved in a state administrative forum, can't they?
  another   another consideration is that this patentee does not practice its patents. but, i mean, isn't that just saying he's, you know, the   the guy in the garage and he's an inventor and the way he's going to market his discoveries is by getting some firm that basically speculates on patents.
justice stevens, we think that the best reading of the five factors is that they continue to respect state laws. certainly, that's what the legislative history, for those of you who would be willing to look at it, of the 1984 amendments reflects. congress was not concerned about how states were defining legitimate medical practices. congress was concerned about the failure to enforce existing state law. and that's clearly reflected in the legislative history, some of which is set out in the state's brief, on page 36, in note 16. but if you look at those five factors, what they are addressed to is individual applicants   that is, individual doctors   not to broad medical purposes. and what you're seeing here in the attorney general's claim of authority, for the first time, is rules that are not addressed to controlled substances, per se, but to medical practices, and that is something that the congress simply never contemplated giving you.
that's correct. and  
moving to what i   the point  
but the important point here is official  
yes.
yes. absolutely. the second circuit is a lower court.
it was argued in his initial habeas. it was appealed to the eighth circuit, because the eighth circuit initially granted the writ on batson grounds. so he appealed it at that point and the eighth circuit said, basically with very little analysis, determined that aedpa applied because he had to refile after the act and aedpa applied to petitions filed after the act.
your friend says it's more favorable to say the claims are unimpaired.
maybe, but it's possible the oregon court would say: well, no instructions are perfect, but   and no set of jury instructions is perfect. but if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera. we find the instructions weren't perfect but, given oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.
  which is the same  
it's not just a matter of using the same word.
why does it speak about sham issue ads?
either is valid or is not valid. you'd like to find one that says it's not valid, so what's your best effort in any field of law.
well, the water slows down, meanders around, as it would in an eddy, and continues on through the dam, down the river. if you take a water molecule, it comes down, goes through and out. if   unless you get  
your argument that focuses on the dealer's profits, i guess, doesn't depend upon you losing those sales at all. i mean, if you   you had made all the sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd have the same argument, right?
deputy scott took the action that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury to third parties other than to mr. harris because there was no one in his immediate path of travel.
but the   the hallmark difference here is that it   it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason  
well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the department of labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services. the exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons congress adopted that.
first, i think there's no question that heidi ahlborn owned the chose in action because under arkansas law her claim was complete by the time the glass and the metal stopped falling to the highway. secondly, as to the who owned the proceeds depends upon the extent to which the state was allowed to take an assignment. if the state was allowed to take an assignment from something other than the claim for medical expenses, then they owned the proceeds. our contention is that the state was only allowed to take an assignment under the language of the statute for the claim for medical expenses, and in that case  
well, he certainly had some sense of reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance. and i would   i would point the court to  
may i ask you, what is a typical administrative record that is developed in these proceedings? there's never a transcript, is there?
  that doesn't strike me   and that   that's what respondent says rand said, not   not one of the other ones. and you have to go down each of the other six, and they have a response for each one.
so we can reach those other issues if we wish.
  state to prove voluntariness. but i still haven't heard your answer to why we should not credit the finding of fact by the trial judge.
if the defense is forced to rest or put on a case.
yes.
well  
i   i think that argument is incorrect. first of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. but second of all, the notion that funds for inherent federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to   to the terms of the isda itself. and if you'll look at page 12a   and i'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1)   what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. and then later on down in the paragraph  
  or did i misread it?
hiland dairy?
but i   i don't see how the   8 i   i guess my   my point is i don't see how you can 9 avoid it. the   the argument   i think we would all 10 agree that the argument was this person has committed 11 repeated crimes. we're asking you to bear that in mind 12 for the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating 13 factors. in the course of committing repeated crimes, he 14 has learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time 15 not to leave any witnesses. how can you divide the tendency of that 17 argument, repeated crimes for purposes of aggravation, 18 from the tendency of that argument to say repeated crimes 19 in the future if he gets a chance? this is the kind of 20 guy we're dealing with. how can you draw that line?
but you're changing the hypothetical. my hypothetical was simply a pay case.
in the present case or the new case?
i think if anything, justice souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as justice alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. and the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law. so that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing, knowing the facts. and of course, willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances. in addition, the logical structure of the act   as i mentioned, we had negligence and actual damages. we have a reckless standard, a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions. and as i started to say, a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the hazen paper case and thurston and mclaughlin cases interpreting the ada and the flsa and other similar cases.
  put it in number  
well, he has made a determination of the facts that will establish probable cause.
yes your honor, sorry.
i don't understand the seventh amendment argument here. congress can surely articulate the standard that's going to be applied as a matter of substantive law. if congress says, you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that doesn't interfere with the seventh amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard.
it would, or would not?
now, the solicitor general, i guess, suggests that the christiansburg garment standard is the appropriate one.
and   and i should also point out that   that in   in our response to the petition in the benitez petition, we expressly   we expressly argued that 1182(d)(5)(a) is an independent source of authority.
what happens when they arrive at the receiving institution is there needs to be time for a record review. the records do not arrive at the exact same time as the inmates. and so they convene a classification committee and at which point they review the records.
no. (laughter.)
here's the difference.
the rule that we look first to the   yes, your honor. yes.
oh  
of course.
i'm sorry. it's  
well that's exactly what he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a five-year period.
sure, sure.
if it   if it is textually okay, if the warrant is valid under the fourth amendment, that it must be clearly stated that the time and the   and the significant limit on the officer's power to search is the time of 6:30, that must be clearly stated on the warrant to satisfy the particularity clause of the fourth amendment.
so if you have a wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological connection to a tributary of navigable waters through one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of the united states?
or mis-carried, like handled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a place where it's going to be damaged. it seems to me that   i'm not sure what additional weight "negligent transmission" covers if you have a reasonable reading of "miscarriage."
well, suppose i just tie it in with windshield wipers.
but do you see  
justice ginsburg, the model penal code does say that. it was adopted, i think, in 1962. and i think that it is telling that, in the years since 1962, since this court recognized that the death penalty was constitutional again in the 1970s, no state has expressly adopted a statute that permits consideration of residual doubt in  
and how does that  
yes.
two  
well, within this exception   the threshold issue   i do want to make sure that i focus on this   the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. the government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.
how is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?
thank you, counsel. mr. whisman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
right.
no. no. and   and, and just to finish, in tinker even with a viewpoint concern, the court said if you could show material disruption, and   and the court made that clear in tinker, by, by its comparison to several lower court decisions where wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had caused disruption. and the third category in tinker itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the rights of other students to be secure and be let alone. that's tinker dealing with political speech. but in frazier and hazelwood the court identified additional categories of speech that could be governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of hazelwood. the court made clear that the ability to regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the question of whether there would be disruption or whether there would be  
i am, your honor.
  with the attorney general, is there a liberty interest in not being transferred from prison 1   level 1 to level 2  
no, i  
i don't think it's an exhaustive list, justice alito. it   the court has held in previous cases that rico used concepts and terms of breadth. this would appear to be that, as the court said in both h.j. v. northwestern, russello, and turkette.
  to have done that.
well, then  
right.
to be sure, it was  
well, your honor  
  of constitutional violations  
it was a deposition. it was attached to a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the disposition of a rule 60 motion in the district court. that's how it came before the   before the court of appeals.
except that the president doesn't think that the remedy is in federal habeas. the president thinks that the remedy is within the states.
so what we're really arguing is what   what is michigan law on the subject, but the   the issue we've got is not michigan law.
look, the   imagine   i'm just repeating what justice souter said. there must be   it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but i haven't heard the answer. he knows michigan law or his lawyer does. the michigan lawyer looks at the statute. it says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate. so he thinks the law is shall not. i have no right. so he doesn't not only   not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive. he has no such right. now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything? and obviously, a person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal no matter what and then he says, okay, i waive my right to appeal, i mean, really.
there's no analogous statute. there is no other statute we've been able to find where private citizens are made equal partners with government in the design and approval of government actions.
no, your honor, i'm not aware of it.
definitely not. the word "knowingly" usually connotes knowledge of the underlying facts. and, in this case  
your honor  
  do you accept the fact that the government can charge taxes on the sale of cigarettes and compel   and use that money to tell people that they're dangerous?
well, there is an agreement to pay a fee for a service, and in that sense there is a transaction, yes.
  and so, what   and the question is, what's unreasonable about that?
but it's not just a characterization. if it's something that has, for example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say, no, i didn't. now, is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident?
from the inception of the rules.
what makes it a fee instead of a tax other than the court saying so?
well, was there anything in the facts that a reasonable officer would know from looking in the window to suggest that these   the adults were not   did not have the intention of inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young man that they were restraining?
if i may, your honor, the rule does not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a presumption of correctness. it doesn't even say that   that any report shall receive a presumption of correctness. it says the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge.
you couldn't have the plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a plan without the insurance policy. it's just a different way of paying for the same thing.
no. if i could continue on that, if i could add on, if i could add on, the way insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million customers and 3 million rates. they have ranges and most of them will have a top tier. they may have specialized things for employees, but putting aside a specialized category, there's a top range and they will tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 percent of people fit in there. so they know what the best rate is. they know what the next, above average rate, the standard rate.
yes, but the transaction case situation is different.
and then when the delaware case was over, then what should he have done?
it's a mixed question?
well  
your argument, i guess, is this argument. now you're conceding the parent does have a right to go to court, but he can only complain about something that hurts him. right?
yes.
but not  
yes.
it's absolutely one step removed from that.
well, i think that, of course, the prison can reduce its damages liability, and, of course, where we have a continuing violation after exhaustion, which is what   when people file these lawsuits, when they have continuing problems, like mr. goodman alleges were continuing problems in his case   we will have cases where we have very much   very likely to have deliberate indifference. and so, i think that's an important thing, too. i think the other important point about turner v. safley that the solicitor general spoke about   right?   many of the constitutional rights in the prison setting that are significant here don't implicate turner v. safley. eighth amendment cruel-and-unusual-punishment claims don't implicate turner v. safley, as this court said in the johnson case. and we have a very substantial record of eighth amendment violations. of course, the eighth amendment requires accommodation of serious medical needs, as this court has said ever since estelle v. gamble, and "serious medical means   needs" is a term that's very close to the way this court has narrowly read the disability definition in the ada. and so, i think another very significant aspect of the congruence and proportionality here is how close the ada's disability definition is to the class of people who implicate constitutional rights, affirmative constitutional rights of accommodation, under the eighth amendment itself. and so, i think that's another very significant aspect of the tightness of the fit here. but, here, i think the most salient fact is, if you ever had a record justifying prophylaxis nationwide, the record here, that touches on 37 different states, that includes, in many cases, statewide findings of constitutional violations, is it, it's a record that justifies, certainly, some prophylactic legislation; at least   at the very least, the minimal prophylaxis that we have in the ada in the prison setting. it's a kind of   it's a kind of prophylaxis that's very much like the kind of prophylaxis this court has previously upheld in tennessee v. lane, where we had very similar affirmative constitutional obligations, and in nevada v. hibbs, where we had a much less significant record, nationwide, of constitutional violations. and so, for all those reasons, you know, we believe that the ada is congruent and proportional in the prison setting. and if the court has no further questions  
nonetheless, they did enter a settlement which included that this behavior was going to stop.
in that former question as to whether california theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule? that even if california has some minor variations   not just in aiding and abetting but in what constitutes theft   minor variations from what the general national rule is, they should be disregarded? and if not, why not?
those are the only defendants you are concerned about?
not   we contend that they would be subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if the state could show that they are closely tailored in a  
all right. you think   fine. the   the   but the   the issue it seems that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the non-constitutional claims   and this is why i want to get your response   is simply that it is a fair implication from congress having set up on non-constitutional matters a system of arbitration to require your client to go through that system before seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters in a federal district court. now, that's the normal rule in administrative law. what is the argument that it wouldn't apply in your case?
it's  
but  
mr. boynton, may i just   may i just ask this question? is part of your position that the federal statute does not prevent michigan from waiving the $10 fee on   for this particular purpose?
but are there any trafficking offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a "trafficking offense" that way?
and what, mr. lamken, would be the normal procedure in the state? you make an application for a permit to a zoning board. what is the standard operating procedure under state law? suppose we don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.
right.
was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?
what is the source of the rule in teague? could congress overturn the rule in teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is retroactive or that everything is retroactive?
right?
may i just ask one further?
  only talking  
the software is the component?
there was specific knowledge here.
so did   then you are bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is not the sentence. you are saying there's an earlier judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a official civil case, if you have a determination of liability, that doesn't give you a final judgment. the judgment will come at the end of the case when damages are determined.
so perfectly   the   the prisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after the first clause is satisfied, the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized. this movant was too late, if you measured the year from that right but he wasn't   he wasn't waiting for any retroactivity decision. he filed before the retroactivity case.
at that point, yes, because they   they are stating that they intend upon using that rather  
the plan, your honor, is not based solely on that supposition. this plan is based on the supposition that a school that is racially identifiable, and that would include a white racially identifiable school, does not provide to the students in that school the compelling benefits that our board believes are presented by racial integration. the compelling benefits, some of which are the benefits that this court identified in grutter, from the racial diversity that was a byproduct  
i would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.
correct?
the test is from the outset, your honor.
  souter. and, indeed, i would add to that that the conspiracy charge here, justice kennedy, is   the problem with it is compounded by the fact that the tribunal itself is charging a violation of the laws of war, when the military commission has never operated to try violations of terrorism in stateless, territoryless conflicts. that is, it's not just the charge, but it's where the charge operates that we find so central, that the   that there are two different things  
my answer is that you can't deprive an inmate of his constitutional right of free speech  
not just 2 weeks. and she understandably experienced much stress in that time. she worried about how she would be able to feed her children, could she get them christmas presents. that was   there was nothing that she got, when it was determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the medical expense that she incurred because she had that stress.
the only thing that is incorporated into 1101(a)(43) is the definition in (c)(2) official   not (c)(1), the definition of  
our basic position is  
well, what if they said they agreed in writing not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient? or if they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?
it didn't say this, but suppose it had. you have to inform this individual, and if you don't inform the individual, you have to give him a remedy so that he is not prejudiced thereby. now, if it had said that and the state or the federal government refused to give him a remedy and it's part of american law, wouldn't we have to say that american law, federal law, treaty law requires you to do that rather than what you're doing, if it had said that?
  didn't we?
and   and that is a rule that, i take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe you do.
and that language came from one of our opinions, didn't it? the branding language?
that's why you don't have "in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as justice stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.
so you agree or you submit that you can have a definite description of something that's unpatentable because it's too broad?
  to private school. but we don't think that the facts of this case bear on the question of who bears the burden of proof in the run of the mine case. it's  
  is my understanding of the maryland law in effect when this happened correct that if you prevail on suppression, your client cannot face charges, no matter what the other evidence is?
  even if the patent holder chooses not to raise the license, the court would have to, on its own motion, say, "sorry, you didn't   you're not the master of your defense. we decide that you have to effectively plead the license."
well, if that's true  
that's correct.
well, the dams slow down the water as it comes down the presumpscot. and because the dams slow down the water, then the river widens in an area called an impoundment area. but the   there is a continuous motion leaving the dam in the same amount of water that comes into the area above the dam.
i think it's a realistic   with all due respect, i think it's a realistic response. i'm not faulting them. i applaud them for doing what was a reasonable thing.
this isn't just 20 or 30 days.
so we   we have your assurance that that's what happens here.
yes.
  at most, it would allow him to prosecute, or to move for the dis-certification of doctors who engage in that practice. and if the state chooses to do it without doctors, it would be okay.
i think in that situation, justice kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened potential of a recurrence. the person could come back. there's no protection on the scene. the reason that she's calling 911 and not a friend or   or a health care provider is that she believes she needs protection right then. and the   the nature of an emergency is such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who is seeking help, as well as the official responder from the government, to solve that urgent problem. any evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really an incidental  
  oregon supreme  
oh, no, "you   you have to go there late. you"  
  the tax.
sounds like wickard to me.
i think that if the parties litigate the question of whether or not it was an assault with   with a firearm, as opposed to litigate the offense of assault with a deadly weapon, and then there's merely an omission from the elements, i think that's a different case. but i don't  
the   all the habeas petitions are run through the office of the attorney general, so that the   when the solicitor general from the state of michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim, that means all habeas cases in michigan essentially there will be   that argument will not be advanced.
well, first of all, justice stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to  
yes. yes.
let me ask this question. supposing in the annual review before a promotion is concerned the officer making the recommendation was instructed not only to decide what increase would be appropriate but also to review past history and decide whether or not the employee was being paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and that was part of the assignment. would you have a case if that were the case?
  for the states not to have sovereign immunity in bankruptcy, then you would conclude that the article 1 bankruptcy clause includes the abrogation power. so, i think it's, sort of, two sides of the same question. returning to justice ginsburg's question, a second reason for not addressing katz's arguments were, they were not passed on below. as this court noted in granfinanciera, where  
  after the entry of judgment. so, from the point of view of the district court, if the court ever wants to get to the end, wants to put a time limit on this, the only way to do it is to enter judgment. that forces the moving party to get a 50(b) motion  
but you're saying he can't later bring any claim about the sentence?
in this particular case, there was   it was necessary to make an additional finding of fact, even though there may be cases out there in which you could get consecutive sentences official without an additional finding of fact?
what was she calling 911 for if she didn't want help?
the california supreme court did say that its compensation law  
that's correct, your honor.
that would be in the district court  
is this text that you're referring to, is it someplace   is the text someplace where we can look at it while you're explaining this to us?
i like your answer better, your honor. (laughter.)
but that's   that's actually what's disturbing me about this, because i thought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and announcing when he has reasonable grounds for thinking he might get shot if he didn't. so, i   as i read the briefs, i thought maybe that's not how it's being implemented, that the policemen are supposed to run the risk of being shot. i didn't think that was the situation. so, i'd appreciate your explaining that to me.
i'm   i'm not sure whether that's rand or warren, but i'm saying that if you compare mr. rand who thought that the death penalty might be applicable for all murder, who repeatedly   in our reply brief, we include the   the recitation   repeatedly said over and over and over and over again that he would answer the three questions yes, depending on the evidence, without any regard for his view about the death penalty, who testified that   i'm not saying that this is somebody whom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in this   we were just before this court saying there's rand and mazza or there's rand and hearn and that's enough to satisfy our burden, i would be up here arguing it but it would be a much more difficult argument. here, those   that comparison has to be taken in the context of not one, not two, but six jurors who are similarly situated who were treated to this questioning by people who engaged in racially disparate shuffling, racially disparate questioning  
yes.
i was   i was referring to the implication that it has often been said that because the european union thinks something, we should, therefore, presume that the world views it that way. we're now talking about  
but our cases say that where we don't speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not regarded as having been decided.
why   why isn't it a right on account of?
well, your honor, for a pacifist religious institution, absolutely.
the problem that i have with your reference to this very   these various pieces of legislation that suggest that congress has a different modus operandi in mind is that congress certainly is aware that epa has authority over pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.
yes, they make that in a subsequent report.
well, counsel, under your view, how   how is the government supposed to prove a negative in every case? how are they supposed to prove the absence of duress?
they were? i   i think that's   isn't that   what rule of   i thought there's a   a rule of federal procedure. i can't remember what   what's the  
why not?
well, in part it depends on whose burden it is. is it the burden of the state, if they're going to use shackles, to somehow establish that it's needed?
but isn't it reviewed for reasonableness   isn't the reasonableness review necessarily going to require what is, in essence, fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by an appellate court?
because the   the challenges essentially cease being peremptory and become quasi-challenges for cause. the state has an interest in maintaining the system as a peremptory challenge system and in maintaining sixth amendment privileges and work product. and it has  
yes. 1964(b) was added because of the traditional common-law rule that the government generally can't get such injunctions. our position is simple. we believe that the hobbs act was changed precisely to deal with the situations where there might be a radical animal-activist group that might be blowing up restaurants that serve meat, or clothing stores, or where there might be situations where racists were blowing up businesses owned by blacks or jews. that's what the hobbs act does. and the rico statute provides, as congress intended, a broad remedial scheme.
well, i guess that's the question, because sometimes people   i have no doubt  
so you think under those other provisions the court doesn't have this inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that you're arguing for here?
except in this case we certainly had the trial court that presided over the sentencing and had seen landrigan in person and was uniquely qualified to make a credibility assessment regarding the points that landrigan made in his affidavit, that "i would have allowed presentation of genetic predisposition."
mr. phillips, i   the steiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in that case, which said that the term "principal activity or activities" embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable.
and the key points that suggest that what i just said is not a fair characterization or a correct characterization are?
any additional evidence, even if it would be insufficient to support a conviction, takes   makes make this   would make this a different case.
it reads this way. what they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the eagles' donation on it back to the eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up, "this property is not owned or maintained by the city of lacrosse, nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon." maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same. but suppose you had a comparable disclaimer. would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?
  about how best to do that?
and that's not   the statute doesn't settle that. our decisions settle that, right? so why should we deal with that, the two, any differently? it's not as though congress wrote the statute differently. we said you can't proceed with unexhausted claims, so you have a choice. either you go out of the federal court and exhaust everything   or even you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in abeyance   or you just lob off the unexhausted claims, stay in the federal court on the ones that you have exhausted. that's all made up by this court. so why should the court react differently in the plra than it did? why should it fill those gaps differently than it did in habeas?
absolutely. absolutely, your honor,.
well, but the   but the factual   - there are factual determinations to be made in the sentencing proceeding that are a continuation of the original trial.
well, your honor, on the merits, we  
yes.
your honor  
but you could do it. the doing of it is perfectly okay.
and both statutes in kreider i take it applied to the refund suit?
let me start labor law and then go more generally. section 1951(c) has a specific provision that makes clear that the hobbs act was not meant to change the protection of labor unions. and, in fact, every one of the statutory references in 1951(c) is to a statute protecting labor unions. enmons specifically says  
that's only correct because california has a discrete three-term sentence.
general clement, that's not what this case is about, because i think you have recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking about whether any fetus will be preserved by this legislation. the only question that you are raising is whether congress can ban a certain method of performing an abortion. so anything about infanticide, babies, all that, is just beside the point because what this bans is a method of abortion. it doesn't preserve any fetus because you just do it inside the womb instead of outside.
i understand that. but your theory, as i read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is that there was a  
is that how we decide it? (laughter.)
we haven't suggested an innovation test, your honor. we were simply attempting to describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of this court in graham, and the holding of this court in graham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court, obviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a way in the prior art, all of these are factual, subsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a great deal of light on the ultimate question in each particular case, but ultimately the question for the court is whether in light of all those underlying factual showings the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. and that ultimately is a legal determination, you can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to justify a patent, but the ultimate question, the ultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in the graham decision.
what do you think about its validity under 101?
do   do you concede that just because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot be entirely taken away in prison?
that's correct, your honor.
but that'll  
counsel, did i understand your earlier discussion, about the department store, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck, and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back, that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even though the economic incidence and effect is going to be the same?
  over all assets of the  
and  
mr. chemerinsky, you have four minutes left.
do you have any basis for your statement that, in a large number, they don't find what they're   anything that they're looking for?
they were looking for a gun.
yes.
i think the reason why i would disagree with that, respectfully, your honor, is, we are not suggesting that it means "shall" in all instances in which a case is remanded. the rule we are   or standard we are advocating for deals with that set of cases in which a plaintiff has successfully sought remand. now, that may constitute most of the cases that are remanded, but there is still the   a separate category of cases, at least one   the case is remanded sua sponte. i could well envision that those would not be governed by a "shall" rule for an award of expenses and fees. the  
i would think that they are still responsible in the same way that they are responsible for other actions that the prior company took.
yes, but they're   what our opinions hold are that there are some matters of producing the same result as a cash subsidy  
if it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.
in many places it is, your honor, and they have a chapter 13 bankruptcy judge. often it's assigned to the most junior bankruptcy judge sitting in the particular jurisdiction. with hundreds and hundreds of cases, the chapter 13 trustee has neither the incentive nor the resources to do the things that a chapter 7 trustee does every single day. and not only that, the chapter 13 trustee does not have the power to go after collecting all of the property and liquidating it. it's denied that power under the statutory scheme. so it makes no sense. it's pointless to say we must   the bankruptcy judge must idly sit by, grant official a motion that's part of this abusive scheme, allow the case to be converted to chapter 13, hold another hearing, have a second set of papers perhaps, only to send the case back to chapter 7.
so if lincoln  
there are nine states that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16 without their parents' consent. that   driving, of course, is the classic example, but  
why didn't you say so? (laughter.)
that's  
but the kaul case, in the context of deciding whether other retailers there had standing, basically said that there was an economic impact that affected the retailers. the kaul case specifically referred, mr. chief justice, to the fact that the legislature had   and this is on page 67 of the pacific 2nd cite of the kaul opinion   the legislature amended the statute   this is at the bottom of the second column   or the first column   to clarify the question where the incidence of taxation falls. the legislature provided that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. then, mr. chief justice, the court went on to evaluate the standing question and allowed the distributors the   to raise the issue, because the economic burden did come through the distributors. it's important, in that context, to note that the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. it's falling on the consumer of the gasoline. the consumer puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven overwhelmingly   the facts are unquestionable in this case   overwhelmingly on the highways of the state of kansas. so that the burden   ultimately, the burden  
all right. and how about the common-law research example  
yes.
yes. what's the answer?
the jury is given in the instruction, instruction number 4 and instruction number 5, a direction as to the effect of their reasoned moral judgment.
but there were lower limits, mr. bopp, and i think that's what justice souter was asking about.
that doesn't make sense.
  just right to be present? is there a requirement of prompt convening of the proceedings?
that   that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but   but   or not preemption but, you know, res judicata. but just out of curiosity or   because i think it is relevant, did the texas probate court have in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the district judge, judge carter, relied upon in showing that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?
well, it has an effect on your back.
so in a sense, you have nowhere to go but up. (laughter.)
yes, well, we're talking about administrative law, which is a field i used to know something about, and i've never thought "exhaustion" included "failure to exhaust," which  
  required.
let me say it in this way, your honor. i don't think that shell and texaco, if they got together and they say, look it, we'll get rid of both of our gasolines, let's just have one gasoline, and they fixed the price, i think that that would be illegal.
in general.
may i ask this question, mr. waxman? i don't know if it's really a legal question exactly, but i have the impression that most of the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. and therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive to be sure these rights are protected. is that a correct impression or is it incorrect?
may i ask this question, mr. verrilli?
that would be one way, your honor.
i thought that the formula was proposed to congress by the department of education, which is not something that congress did in other words, to stop the secretary from whatever he was doing. but it was indeed   wasn't it the secretary's own language that congress enacted?
and it was different than what dr. blake said it meant.
it's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.
so in my example, the arrest would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he didn't know about the sticker.
the word "knowingly" does not travel down the statute to modify "corruptly." it  
but it would add pollutants to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent body or whether it comes from some distant body. the only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did not qualify is   not because there no addition of pollutants. there would be an addition of pollutions from a distant lake, and you   we'd be able to hold a person liable. the only reason there was no addition here was that there was   there was an addition here, but there was no discharge, because it was the same body of water.
i think that's right, your honor. the '33 act, if you look at the act, every provision in it is focused on ipos. it is state of the art comprehensive legislation. the '34 act in three separate provisions gives the sec power to define manipulation. then it has rulemaking power and then it has exemption power. this is comprehensive. it is far more pervasive than the kind of regulation that was before the court in nasd. in that case, there was just unexercised rulemaking power. here we have got voluminous regulations, we have interpretations, we have many enforcement actions aimed at this very same conduct.
but do you  
the facts allege need to be specific enough to suggest  
and those are the sort of considerations that can be taken into account under harmless error analysis. right? the absence of notice, the prejudice. i would have put on this evidence if i had known i was accused of using a handgun.
i don't think it's right.
it's the latter, justice stevens, and only the latter  
right.
well, it can certainly   the   the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. but the findings that justice ginsburg has   has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. it goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. and that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. we may   i'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. we may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. but that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the   the state of   the courts of california should have reached extortion.
so on   on that aspect of the case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation of fifra.
well, we think   we think it is quite a   we think it's a strong confirmation of the pattern in 1101(a)(43), that the statute looks to what official happened in state court, and the state punishment that was authorized there, and the express mention of that   or  
i was going to ask what is the date of the speedy trial act? 1975?
that strikes me as a little odd, doesn't it?
let me ask another general question. if it were true, and i don't think it is in this case, that the biggest district was the one that got the most per pupil money   the two biggest districts that were at the opposite ends of the spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they, under your view?
well, a determination of equipoise   the jury has to find equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt, and that, necessarily, means that the aggravators are not outweighed my mitigators.
  then under pickering  
and that's unconstitutional?
i don't think so. i think it would be ultimately a jury question in this particular category of claims. as   if   if it were the case that employees typically worked the forklift and then the next day worked the   worked the track, then the next day did something else, then i don't think a jury could find that there was a material   materially significant change in responsibilities.
  i think the language is capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you thought was very important, the d.c. circuit, at the end of the day, could decide whether or not there is a requirement that the treaty challenge be brought.
could the officer change his mind? i mean, he   he did say i'm just going to give you a citation, and then he said, mind if i search your car. this is before the   the dog showed up. and suppose the person who had been speeding said, yes, i mind. don't search my car. and then the police said, well, in that case i'm going to arrest you.
why   why shouldn't the litigant be put on notice by a district court decision? let's assume it's in his own circuit.
but  
and so far as we know, it won't.
  although they can avoid it, we can't.
  and injunction.
extends a lot further, i would think.
and that is a fact that we accept as true in the immediate vicinity. the tape shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before, and i think that a reasonable officer at the time would believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on that road.
is all of that in the record?
why not? why didn't you ask when and where was this agreement.
that's right, justice o'connor. and then i think the court explained and elaborated that the test is whether or not there are commercially significant noninfringing uses. and i would say what the ninth circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test of mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus maybe some anecdotal evidence.
this court  
i think you could measure it from either time point. i think the better view is actually that it would be measured from the beginning of the surgical operation, though the evidence of their intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very, very relevant. the reason i would say that is i think if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme amount of dilation at the point they start the procedure, i think the intent of congress would still be for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point, rather than an intact removal. but if this court thought that the constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then you could start from the beginning of the dilation because i think in fairness the differences between the two procedures are probably most manifest in the dilation regimen. i also think, though, the record supports the notion that there are differences even once you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the fetus. i mean, dr. chasen for example, who is trying to do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal body. if you're   obviously if you're performing a dismemberment d&e you're not trying to swing the second leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on the first extremity that prevents itself. so i think there are differences even at the procedural level. so i think that it would probably be most consistent with congress's intent to measure it from the beginning of the surgical part of the procedure. but if you, as i say, in order to save the statute, i think it's amenable to the contrary interpretatio.
  "program, we would give you this parcel of real estate." would that also be subject to the same analysis?
thank you, mr. jett. the case is submitted.
yes.
i'm not sure, professor tribe, that the cases you cite at page 22, 23 of your brief really support your position. the question is whether there should be a freestanding cause of action for damages.
yes, there always are other potentials. however, i would submit that a vehicle traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage in a very short period of time before the police officers can figure out what route he's going to take.
yes, your honor, there was additional analysis, particularly of the six jurors miller-el claims were discriminated against, which this court did not review the first   in its first opinion specifically. and a review of miller-el's purposeful discrimination claim must focus on these six jurors. and given the   the views expressed by these six veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck them. each venire member peremptorily struck by the state had voiced views unfavorable to the state but were not subject to a challenge for cause. these reasons are race-neutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in fact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered. carrol boggess indicated that her beliefs   on the questionnaire indicated her beliefs would impair   would impair her ability to impose the death penalty as a juror. she referred to her   an execution as a murder during her voir dire and other comments evincing hesitance regarding her ability to impose the death penalty.
but could you not require submission to  
the only one who gets the advantage of the lower   the lower income tax rate and the lower property tax rate is someone who is located in the state. it's exactly the same.
likely, the state would   would have   have   if those were the facts and that's all the facts that we had, then the state would likely have charged murder and asked for a lesser-included offense instruction for manslaughter.
  need that accompanies releasing parolees.
  mail-specific any different than the grocery boy   i mean, than the grocery-specific, under your view?
is   is another   is another difference   and i don't know if this   is another difference that in the hypothetical case with the jury, the jury has not yet deliberated  
correct.
but just to follow up from justice stevens' question, what makes this nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic control on a part of the car that doesn't move?
and certainly the intermediate  
now, with regard  
the court has recognized that   that federal courts, especially in an unusual circumstance like that   but federal courts do have the obligation under erisa to determine a common law of rights and obligations under erisa plans. and there are doctrines like unconscionability and other doctrines that may be applied in particular cases where some plan is just taking advantage of another party, where  
well, presumably duke could say, we looked at the reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988 official thing came up and they are surprised by that. now you're saying it's already too late because somebody else challenged it in 1980?
no, no, but it doesn't   it doesn't say   it says they have to comply with state water quality standards, doesn't it?
justice scalia, what the magistrate is predicting is that there will be receipt, but the magistrate is   is not predicting that there will be contraband inside of that house at that point. he's actually shipping that discretion to the officer in the field.
okay.
did the opinion make a point of that?
well, there's no language in category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any other reason justifying relief.
it does, and when there are more choices than there are seats available.
the case is now submitted.
  in part. am i right about that or not?
if   well, i think, if i understand your question, if you make   and it depends upon where you make it, where you transfer  
well, where these cases come up again and again, your honor, is someone brings a lawsuit in court and then there is a motion to compel arbitration and there is a challenge to that motion. there are next to no challenges anywhere in the country right now in the   after your decision 2 years ago, in which anyone is saying, oh, this transaction doesn't involve interstate commerce. there are going to be a small number of challenges involving companies operating at the edge of legality and maybe a tiny number of challenges involving consideration where people are going to be able to say there's no contract at all, there's not even a   there's not even the beginning of a contract here. there's not going to be a wealth of hundreds of the   of those, but there's going to be some cases, mostly involving the payday lending industry, but they're just aren't dozens of businesses out there where there is a conceivable, plausible, colorable argument that the whole line of business is violating the law.
  we normally don't look into the mind of the officer to decide whether his action was okay or not.
isn't that so? i mean, that's what that   one of the reasons the case was here, that the ninth circuit simply smacked down a district court factual finding that he had waived any mitigating evidence. isn't that what happened?
  well within  
yes.
and may   and if it does it as a binding rule that's not   that's not subject to change, i suppose that that   that that would be possible. but the fact is   actually, a good example is, in one of the administrative cases that the united states cites in their brief, the united states versus l.a. tucker lines, what   the argument there is, "we didn't need to present this argument to the interstate commerce commission, because they had a rule that meant that they couldn't accept our claim, and the court   and the court says no to exhaust. you do have to present the claim. they may change it."
i'd   i'd like to correct that very clearly. as soon as mr. bustillo got new counsel on direct appeal  
i mean, there was one that was $99,000, if i remember right.
because we are not claiming the benefit of a bargain to be a spy. we are not seeking compensation  
he acknowledged it was something that   this argument was something that was proper for consideration, but   however, he argued that the evidence of belmontes' religious conversion, which happens   you know, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the murder, in this case   was very weak evidence. but he did, nonetheless, tell the jurors that they could consider belmontes' prior character as bearing on his present character now.
so this is even farther removed.
if  
but isn't your position that an employer violates title vii unless the employer periodically reviews the entire pay record of every employee to make sure that there has never been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any point in the past that would have a continuing present effect on the amount of money that the employee is paid?
yes.
just getting rid of old language that was no longer  
  in providing  
how do you answer  
  denotes  
yes, your honor. yes, justice souter. mr. freibach, who was the earlier foreman, testified that under his watch, he needed between 250 and 300 pounds of cement, and that there was a constant inconsistency in the sludge content coming out of the ponds.
yes, your honor, and, under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, the analysis is exactly the same.
well, rfra didn't involve a   a limitation to situations in which federal funds were involved, and as i understand this statute does.
yes, your honor.
that's exactly right. no bonus dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.
well, i think, justice scalia, that you have to look at the   i think, the statute in two steps. one is, i think it's quite clear that it gives the military a right to gain access to campus as a condition, that it has   that they have to gain access to campus in order to perform their military recruitment.
no, i'm saying  
this is your personal testimony.
well, in the instance of a summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that requires the district court to state in open court in front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of sentence.
would it be bad? would it be bad if that's what he did?
what's your authority for   for the   for opposition that every other jurisdiction does it that way?
mr. goldstein, let me just interrupt a minute. you say if it lacks the   the business justification. but is it not a part of   that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show? that's an affirmative defense.
i have two responses to that, your honor. first of all, with regard to what the ruling in booker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in relation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a), which are the same policy considerations that the court must look at, very similar in california, that there are   the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select any term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would be   whatever he decides to do on tuesday. the court has to do it with regard to the policy considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines decisions were, and what the legislature established should be appropriate sentencing considerations.
your honor, i think it would have been one element of   that   that may have been considered. but in terms of the extraordinary circumstance, innocent of the death penalty or innocence of the offense, it would not rise to that level.
well, as the court below found, and as the tape indicates, mr. harris didn't run anybody off the road. he didn't ram anybody. he didn't try to ram anybody. he was just driving away.
of course, that same problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of evidence. courts are going to view it the same way. you're not going to avoid that problem by excluding evidence.
i believe the answer is that the tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise compromise between allowing school officials to have complete discretion to suppress student speech in order to maintain what they conceive of as their individual mission and the student's right to speak in a nondisruptive manner. the speaker   the tinker case has stood the test of time for 40, almost 30 years and, although  
thank you, counsel.
right.
this case is almost on all fours with carbone. all you've done is transfer the ownership. as you know, in carbone that facility was destined to be owned within less than 2 years from the time the court issued its opinion.
and you rely on merrell dow, which is fine. but i thought there was a separate line of cases that support you, as well as merrell dow.
i thought there's also, isn't there, the pension benefit   even if there's no money in the till for the plan, isn't there a government fund so that the worker would receive the benefit in any event if   i don't see the distinction that you're making based on whether the worker would get a benefit whether or not the employer made the contribution.
i think that if i   i believe that with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the graphic script, what the state is saying is last time we said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed hesitation. and this court observed that, well, yes, but only two of the whites got it. now, they filed a brief that says, well, the other eight were all either struck for cause or by consent. now, that's   that fails for at least two reasons. one, they identified 10. in this court and below, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still not accounted for them. number one. number two, with respect to the eight who they have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that the state has described.
how   how general is   is this problem? and   and to what extent is it tied to the fact that you can bring a second habeas in south dakota? i mean, in   in most states, if this had happened, i presume, when you went back to the state court, the state court would say, you know, you didn't   you didn't put in these claims the last time around and they're procedurally barred. isn't that what would happen in   in most other states?
well, my question is, does it make a difference for the point of distinguishing, or not distinguishing, "live free, or die," and similar ideological matters   does it make a difference that the fundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the way it's carried out, has to do with simple advertising, commercial advertising, the regulation of a commercial matter, commerce  
  "against you."
well, what this court said in gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is potential interference with the administrative scheme for us to decide the sec's views are entitled to considerable deference, the court said. but if they've been submitted in the form of amicus briefs, that is sufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.
  open-and-shut  
  which he thought would be more effective than knocking on   on the   you know, the   the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a very good knock. (laughter.)
justice scalia, that's true, but that imposes a burden under rule 41(b) that simply does not exist in the text of the rule. the rule does not say by order. previous versions of the rule did. other rules in the federal rules of appellate procedure do, and to graft that onto it, despite the absence of that language and an understanding that that's how courts given the ministerial function of   of issuing mandates do their practice would be unfair.
i think this court suggested, in muniz, that perhaps there could be private persons operating prisons, or one would look  
is he   is he a person within the meaning  
no, your honor.
here.
for purposes of obtaining immunity, we were arguing that   which i think is a different argument than we're making here today   we were arguing that the federal tort claims act was not meant to waive our sovereign immunity at all with respect to certain types of governmental activities. but that's not the argument that we're making today. today, we are arguing simply that one must, as the court held in indian towing and rayonier, one should look to the   to the   to the text of the statute, and that that must be the measure of our liability.
it is law that is applied in federal court, though. i assume you have an interest in that.
do you want to make that argument here, or are you going to give up on that argument?
i believe that as a matter of washington law, the answer would be yes. and again, i think it turns on the fact that there's this additional factor, additional element, of capacity to fire that differentiates a handgun from a firearm.
so why isn't it that the end? i mean, here it's not moot. they filed the other action. you point out that you not only think something could wreck the state claim, you would love it to wreck the state claim. and   and therefore, they have this insurance policy in federal court which they'll gear up if and when the state claim does get wrecked as you hope.
  your honor.
okay.
yes, but  
what does somebody like mr. wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases. he isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.
that  
  that's really  
let   let me, if i may, ask you about other possible wage surrogates because what you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the argument, another legislative history argument, to the effect that the   the current provision was meant to overrule two prior cases of this court. and the   the question i have turns on the fact that the   the language is broader than what would merely have been necessary to overrule those cases. so my question is if the broader language does not cover the premiums that we're concerned with here, what other items dealing with   with wage substitutes would it pick up, would it include?
so that would be the same for title ii, which is the public accommodations part of the civil rights act of 1964. so i take it that you are saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the ada would be inapplicable, so title ii, the public accommodations part of the civil rights act of 1964, would be inapplicable.
what if a particular jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally different theory of aiding and abetting? is it simply sufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?
miccosukee assumed that   the soup ladle example from the second circuit; you took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the same thing back. but if i understand what happens as a result of the impoundment of the water and then its release, what comes out is quite different from what was put in. it's kind of like you had a pot boiling with vegetables, and then you put it through a food processor, and then what you got out would be quite different from what went into the food processor.
mr. crawford, you have four minutes.
well, the only reason you would say that congress hasn't done it, justice scalia, is if you concluded that   and i would ask petitioners what their best citations are, because i have not been able to find them   what cases indicate that a country cannot bring the kind of prosecution that the united states did here to vindicate its own independent sovereign  
yes, your honor, but i believe that as justice breyer pointed out, if this emergency happens on a saturday, there is no provision whatsoever for the minor. in addition  
i hope the latter, justice kennedy, because this is a case in which the state is making a waiver argument. and, of course, the waiver argument is not part of   is not the intent of the statute. what the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.
but, as this court explained in piggie   no, excuse me, christiansburg garment, your honor   the imposition of fees discourages activity when it's a federal right that's being enforced, saying that fees are imposed whenever there's a near miss, a reasonable case that's brought to enforce the federal right. you discourage the very thing that congress intended people to enforce. that's my point here. yes, it's true, fees would only be awarded in those cases where the defendant is unsuccessful and the case is remanded. but, for example, in the class action fairness act, that can happen even when there's a perfectly, not just reasonable, but exactly proper ground of removal, because the class action fairness act, among other things, says that when there's more than one-third, and less than two-thirds, the citizens in the state in which the complaint was originally filed, they're in the class, then the district court has discretion to remand the case, even if it's properly brought in federal court, removed to federal court. so, my general point is that congress has enacted these removal statutes to promote federal policy, and that it would be counter to that policy to discourage defendants from removing cases, particularly if the amount of fees that could be awarded would include all the fees incurred in federal court. i mean, we're talking about very substantial fee awards, in that event. and they would be a significant deterrent from exercising the very rights that congress has said defendants should have for the benefit of the public. furthermore, as already pointed out, state court plaintiffs never enforce congressional policy; otherwise, they'd be in federal court, under federal-question jurisdiction. the defendant has not violated federal law, so neither of the exceptional circumstances  
no, i don't think so, your honor. i think judges are   are intelligent people. they read the pleadings beforehand. justice donovan clearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she   she was prepared to ask for argument on it. i don't think that judges do these things so precipitously that they are not going to be confident in their ruling.
your honor, two responses to that question, if i may. the first is that, as a matter of law, it is the client that controls the cause of action and throughout the time period, even after they   they enter into an   a contingent fee agreement, it is the client that owns and controls the cause of action and he decides whether to settle. he decides whether to press forward or withdraw the case. he decides whether to fire the lawyer or not. he is a   he controls the source of the income. therefore  
there is only one class of excludables by the government's own choice. that's   that's basically your answer.
what do you make of the pragmatic argument that seems to cut through all of your objections? the pragmatic argument is both in favor of complete discretion and of suspicionless search, that the in terrorem effect of knowing that these searches can occur at any moment, in fact, discourages recidivism.
well, only  
  much more recently, but yick wo against hopkins.
so we have a lower court opinion in canada, and you   and they have a lower court opinion in australia. is it fair if i come to the conclusion no one has ever really decided this?
but i thought that  
and i assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago.
yes.
but what about gutting? never mind mr. atkinson's argument. what about gutting?
well, is it? i mean, that's   the problem that i have with your argument, mr. grant, is that in life things are often not, it happened or it didn't happen. there is a middle ground, which is this officer is saying, i was there at the relevant time or place and when i was there everything that i did was within the scope of my employment, i didn't do anything that was outside the scope of my employment.
your honor, the state conceded a pre-enforcement challenge brought by a doctor before any particular patient was at risk would be proper.
your honor, the   justice ginsburg, the solicitor general filed its amicus brief here 5 months ago when this court had accepted the case for review. in its brief, the solicitor general said no fewer than seven times, not just as a passing aside, that third party reliance, what the solicitor general called reliance by someone, not only suffices under rico, but sufficed at common law. we agree with the solicitor general's position. here, we have that reliance by a third party, what the government called someone, the state of new york.
which was never   never in effect, right? the new policy  
and the mere fact that it has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem, as far as the commerce clause is concerned. and what you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-state and out-of-state businesses, only in-state business. that's   that was the hawaii case, and all the other cases you cite. but what your argument here is that the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the commerce clause. and i don't know  
of course it does, but when congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.
and that dr. blake was not credible.
yes, that's true, it would be. and the reason we're doing it is because there's a period of time when somebody lies to the government and we don't want actions that are related to that. we'll have to go into that proof to take place more than 6 years later. now, that would be the reason, and i agree it would be contrary. but the difficulty for me is the language seems to point to that reason.
because ultimately the chapter 13 trustee has the same powers of the chapter 7 trustee with the exception, as your honor is pointing out, of possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate. but that's how congress wrote the statute. we should not ignore congress's command about the process of converting and look for exceptions before we proceed to go back to the appellate court  
so it seems to me that if we accept your response to justice ginsburg, we've got to go back and to the extent that we can do anything about it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these things get thrown out more readily.
your honor, i think the answer to that question was provided in this decision in ornelas versus united states, a decision by this court in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a direct criminal appeal involving the question of probable cause. and this court set forth very clearly that the historical facts are given deference. the question of, a legal question about whether those facts reasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent de novo review.
i   i don't believe that wesley was denied due process. they discovered the evidence afterwards and ultimately at that trial they had   the wesley jury had the opportunity to hear what happened in the stumpf trial, and they were able to weigh that case along with the evidence of the stumpf finding and sentence of death and the finding that he was the principal offender. that's something we submit has not happened in this death penalty case.
oh, he's stuck without an attorney. i have no doubt about that. i have no doubt that the treaty was violated. i follow you that far, but now you're talking about the domestic court's power to do what there is an international obligation to do, which is to create a remedy. i'm not sure why that remedy need always be suppression.
it's not really a special rule that we're advocating.
we did.
there are remedies one by one for each of these acts.
no, your honor. this case was tried on the basis of several discrete transaction comparisons. it was not tried on the basis of any systematic study of every offer to reeder and every offer to  
i would really like to have your answer to my opening question, and i said: if your only answer is each time something, he is charged by the blm people, he goes one at a time, engaging a lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths. he doesn't want that. he wants to say: stop, stop this whole pattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern. how does he get that remedy?
but all of those cases were before the pslra where congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard. they said they have to support a strong inference.
why isn't fogerty an example. isn't the   what is the standard that fogerty announces? it rejects the british rule, and that it rejects the one favoring   one party over the other? what is the standard you get out of fogerty, other than pure discretion of the district court?
no.
  pointed out it's  
i still want to go back to my question because i think you may have an answer to it and i want to focus you  
how did they find him, by the way?
i   i wouldn't think so. i think  
well, the case you have here is are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular distinction between public and private ownership, when in the past this court has concluded that a lot of these other distinctions were unworkable.
to put it   this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs. i mean, it's   it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people. the whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. i mean, it  
one court. that's right. so each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140 opinions, having to join in another 280. so resource allocation is one of the pressing concerns in the michigan court of appeals. the situations in which the court of appeals will grant leave on application are rare. it's   it's reluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of the  
there were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply cannon anymore.
and incidentally just for the   are   this ship has   these are regulations that help the disabled?
ms. woodman, you said that they didn't make such an argument in this case and in some other case, but you did not include the argument in the joint appendix, did you?
ms. wright.
well  
let me just  
because, justice ginsburg, i think the focus is on the substantiality of the federal question and that's where the difference between the two situations you are positing lies. with constitutional claims, they are almost always substantial federal questions. with federal statutory violations alleged as part of a state law cause of action, merrell dow says they are not substantial enough to confer arising-under jurisdiction unless congress intended to create a federal private right of action for the violation of that particular statute. so  
well, i disagree with that, and to this extent. can a lawyer in a capital case argue at the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not sentence this person to death because they've had a hard life? yes. of course you can. and why can you do that? because according to this court's cases, that goes directly to the individual's moral culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty. the problem with many of the arguments which were made in this case is they are fundamentally inconsistent with the individual's moral blameworthiness and they can the jury to impose the death penalty in order to stop larger issues, to stop crime, to protect society.
  your position.
since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, i thought that possibly they had   they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. it says "this part"   it doesn't say subpart, it says part   and part is 552. and both regs we are talking about are in the part. and b says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32. nobody thinks that congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33. so as i read that, i thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; part a has more general things. part b has more specific things. where am i wrong?
so he could get law week, legal times, and  
it is correct, your honor, but the central point of both booker and california is that that upper term is being reversed not because it's unauthorized, but because it's unreasonable.
if the individual is convicted in japan, justice stevens, then he would not be under our immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if he did come  
if their position is that they can't confirm or deny to the district court whether we were spies  
so your argument is that this is comparable to using the transcript of the trial.
yes.
  because what's covered is prescribed by law.
i mean, the conversation is not occurring right now. the magistrate has to say in the future, when this warrant is executed, the conversation probably will be occurring. right? and so also here. you know, the   the receipt is not occurring now, but on the basis of all of the evidence before me, i think that that receipt will be occurring.
what about the  
it's my understanding that under   currently in california about 20 percent of the prison population has an upper term. so i don't know how many cases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since blakely or since apprendi, but probably in the thousands, possibly.
which is not commerce. sorry, not commerce.
no. well, i   well, i don't   in fact, its main office is   is a creature of statutory designation, but i think what  
the   nevertheless, the judge's response relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his personal opinion as to that of a   some   as   as   of   of   to argument, which is a statement of an advocate. and the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase, and through the penalty phase, and at the concluding instructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be getting the instruction on the law from the court. and here  
that's correct.
  the implication is that when congress meant to include state offenses, it said so.
we believe it was diligent within 6 the   the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the 7 plain language. and the   the fall-back position, to 8 address your question and justice souter's question, is 9 that we don't believe   we believe this is engrafting a 10 whole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we 11 have. the fall-back position of the government is to say, 12 all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to 13 say that we're going to trigger the date on when the 14 vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have 15 been discovered. and to do that, what they're saying is, 16 well, let's give him a year from the time of the federal 17 sentencing. so   or   or maybe even earlier, dating 18 back to the time of the original conviction in state 19 court. so they add that 1-year statute of limitations. 20 then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during 21 the pendency of state habeas, and then we'll add another 22 1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the 23 vacatur is obtained. so we end up with   instead of the 24 plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations 25 with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling 1 provision that is, by the way, in section 2244. we believe that petitioner's interpretation, 3 although the answer is not difficult, it   it is the 4 correct answer. on what date did the   could the vacatur 5 have been discovered through the exercise of due 6 diligence? and the answer i think was  
whereas, if there's one exhausted claim, they could   they could keep the federal   petition in federal court and stay it and let the unexhausted claim be exhausted.
so your point would be that they can do this if we amend the federal rules. if it's a problem take it to the rules committee?
and would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?
mr. olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount. and if that were true, as a matter of fact, then that would be a   a plain violation of antitrust law, wouldn't it?
and i  
if i could come back to, may i ask this question: is part of your argument that even under the brecht standard it was not harmless?
the burden shifts the prisoner to produce some evidence. i didn't understand that to be  
well, that   no, that's just 15   that's 1512, for witness tampering. but for the act of destroying documents to interfere with a proceeding  
and that's in the record, that she made an application for the first grade?
yes, but the abuse was not coming from people who filed   or the   let's say the line that identifies the abuse was not a line between those who file a grievance within 2 days and those who do not. i mean, that's   that   it's true, if you   if you have a 2-hour statute of limitations, you're going to keep out a lot of cases, but it's not a tool that is particularly suited to the problem that congress was dealing with, which is frivolous actions.
all right.
correct.
thank you, mr. himmelfarb. the case is submitted.
it is in the record?
yes. insofar as the suit against the defendant is concerned, she's not   she does not have an interest in minimizing.
now, let   let me ask you about that. let's   let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. is there any authority that tells us what to do next? this is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. do we have any obligation to save the injunction? send it back and let it be done. let it be done all over again. i mean, why   why should we rewrite it up here? do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?
i'm sorry. doesn't the axis turn?
no. this is my   this is a special day in boston   (laughter.)
factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me.
right. okay.
what if she'd been operating the forklift for only a week and then she was reassigned? would that still be discrimination under any standard?
but in rapanos' case.
  or other states?
i'm not surprised. (laughter.)
reading justice brandeis' opinion, i can't believe that that was the basis for his result.
may i interrupt?
mr. waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this court would simply hold the petition if there were   if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the ninth circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this court could have just held it because the ninth circuit was likely soon to dispose of it.
it says  
no, he didn't, but i'm asking you to imagine that he did.
general clement, i'm just thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge would be really much different from what we have seen already.
well, that's where i have a little bit of trouble. it's not   the underlying right is still the same. it's the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education. and that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney won't. and i'm just wondering how significant additional exposure we're talking about? and what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not.
no. i understand it's not. i'm just kind of curious about where we're going down   we're going down a new road in this whole area. i'm just wondering how   what our destination is.
why would that be? i mean, i've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a problem. so i move it to the top of the garage door. does that suddenly   nobody before thought of moving it to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought of moving it to a different part that moves in a constant ratio with the accelerator.
  you ask for rehearing en banc? because any judge, including me, can make a mistake. what did you do?
there is some information to that effect in the amicus brief of ohio and every other state of the union, justice o'connor, but my recollection is that the states are creditors in probably the majority of bankruptcies around the country.
  phase 5.
all right.
why there is not a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood?
it intrudes on  
i   i am not aware of one from michigan. i am aware that there have been civil judgments against officers from other jurisdictions. i'm not aware of one in michigan. i know there have   there are some suits that have been brought in the eastern district that are pending. and   and part of the difficulty is civil suits can be brought. they can be settled. there can even be trials and damages awarded, and they won't be in the reports. they're not in the f.supp.'s. they're not in the  
yes, it was, justice o'connor.
not necessarily. i mean, there were other   there was other  
well, i think  
and under their test too, you say it's applying the same rule of   it's not a new claim. it's the same claim as   as   just that they   shows that the district judge got it wrong.
why? why couldn't he just be enjoined from   from similar defamation? i mean, this   this enjoins him from   from true speech. at least he could   he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming cochran in the same manner. and if he did that, then   then he could be punished.
we assume that. then the question is, what is a proper remedy?
the dog cases, justice kennedy   and i   let me make sure we're   i have your hypothetical, and that is, the police officer at home grooms the dog  
right.
well, i guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can congress say it is?
you're envisioning that one case will take care of it. that is, if the court rules against you, that's the end of it. you can't come back with another inadequacy because you'd be barred by claim preclusion. on the other hand, if the state comes up with an acceptable alternative, you agree to it. that's one thing. the court holds   but there wouldn't be a second episode i think. one way or another this proceeding would end it.
well, that   that's correct, your honor. of course, the   it's an exception under apprendi that the   the prior crime. but what   what i'm saying is it's   it's a slightly different situation in terms of it being   i know we have blakely and the whole sentencing factor issue. but it   it's a slightly different use of a prior and making   in other   in all those cases, the   it's a crime whether or not you have a felony. the felony might make it a more serious crime. in our case, this isn't a crime without this felony. that's the thing that makes it a crime. and what i'm saying is the only situation we have where something that's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the use of a felony. there's no other situation where a foreign felony is employed or has been employed in that situation. if there's no other questions, i'd like to, if it would please the court, reserve the  
the ordinary provision for venue would be that venue lies in the district where the crime occurs.
so probable cause is not enough to eliminate the presumption of innocence.
well, that's a   that's a bit different. you were   you were asserting a moment ago i thought   please correct me if i'm wrong   that this was a violation of fifra because it was misbranded.
i believe, justice souter that what the court was doing there which is somewhat similar to the analysis below in the oregon court of appeals, was to talk about the prospective future victims of this fraud, that if it were not deterred which is a consideration that the oregon statute makes clear, if it was not deterred then this kind of consideration for the same acts having the same effect on others then doesn't allow you to make sure that on that scale that this is at the high end of what we are  
i don't know how they know it, your honor.
why   why not? we make up a lot of stuff. (laughter.)
that's right.
no, your honor. it certainly was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a discussion of the facts in the case. however, based on the totality of the entire proceedings, it's clear that that statement did not render the entire trial unfair because  
  that's addressed to private  
thank you, mr. garre. mr. milkey, you have 3 minutes remaining.
issue preclusion should not apply because it prevents the federal courts from deciding the federal takings questions. if  
but that's the   that's a consequence of a determination that it's jurisdictional in any case. right?
  that part of the action  
  just for local protectionism.
well, we're talking here about a question of whether or not coverage is subject matter jurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go beyond the text and you start evaluating the various aspects of title vii, mr. chief justice, you are going down a   a slippery slope. an example would be a case perhaps where a   in fact, a case that i'm currently involved in where a plaintiff is alleging that they were discharged discriminatorily. and the reality is from the employer's perspective, that that person was never terminated. they're still an active employee. that is an essential issue of a cause of action. the coverage of title vii  
now, if they are covered   if they are covered, as i thought, then what is the difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby the insurance companies pays for their health benefit when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit when they have an accident at work?
well, then you're going back to putting weight on the absence of authority. in those contracting states, most of which i guess are civil system states, and in civil systems, you'll have magistrates who do take this kind of thing into account, but you won't find a case on it. so   so  
that say   that say accusations to a   made to a law enforcement officer, in the case of oregon and the pending michigan bill, accusations of domestic violence are admissible so long as they are made reasonably freshly   but they give a 24-hour time frame   they   they are admissible. no need for excitement. so   so the idea that   that the jurisdictions have limited this to   to excited utterances is   is not   is not so. if   if the court affirms the decision here, i think the message would go out that these   that these statutes are perfectly okay.
would   would you comment on that? i   i understood from the brief there was a suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge volume of   of printed material that we're not troubled with now.
  of "drug-trafficking crime" in (c)(2), which says  
  inside the building; just, unfortunately, the means wasn't right. no warrant.
that includes both the firearm   the additional time for firearm enhancement, as well as the time for the deadly weapon enhancement.
does the government have any position on the mootness question here?
may i ask this question: supposing he is the only source of the information that's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the filing of the complaint, and after the complaint is filed discovery reveals other violations of law on which the government prevails, but they do not prevail on the theory of the original complaint. would he be   come within the statute or without? the statute focuses on the information that gave rise to the suit, not on what's found by way of discovery.
yes. but in this case, the  
so you think there is a compelling interest in preventing people from thinking about an issue and then calling their senator during the blackout period. that's the compelling interest that, in effect, you are arguing for.
we have evidence that it was called out on the radio. "i'm pursuing somebody." whether scott knew we don't know.
well, before you do  
do you know what ferc's  
it's not unusual that counties maintain and run bridges in your state, is it? i mean, that's  
well, there were  
so in other words, you're saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider not just what this particular defendant succeeded in accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to accomplish?
only civil.
well, do you see an underlying constitutional problem as to non-election expenditures that are still political expenditures?
they can, but do   do you know that there's   there's one out there? i don't know  
i still don't really understand this part of the case very much. assume that a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, and we think the government's reading is the better reading. and the executives think about it and they say no, we don't think that's right. has that proved reckless disregard?
because we are concerned with the reliability of the death sentence. if   if shackles are inherently prejudicial in guilt phase where character isn't even at issue and that has a lesser standard of reliability, then they certainly are inherently prejudicial in the guilt   in the penalty phase where the defendant's life is at stake. and as justice o'connor has recognized in her concurrence in the eddings v. oklahoma case, this court goes to extraordinary measures to ensure that the defendant sentenced to be executed is afforded process that will guarantee, as much as humanly possible, that the sentence was not imposed out of whim, passion, prejudice, or mistake. shackling opens the door to prejudice and mistake by giving the jury the impression that the defendant is particularly dangerous and therefore worthy of a death sentence.
well  
no, the way you get claims, which is really the   the direct text on the rule says you can add a claim if it arises out of the same   is if the transaction relates to the   to give you an example, to an involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of a miranda claim that arises out of that police   alleged police misconduct that culminated in the admission of the confession. you could also have a massiah violation that related back to a fifth amendment claim. and you could have other types, too.
  the suspect's  
are you going to rely on the fact that dogs were trained to do this sort of thing back in the 18th century?
but if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.
you can make a contract preempt state law. is there any precedent for that?
yes  
does different outcome mean  
electronic market.
well, are you claiming that your   your people are   were not spies?
right.
so why   let's see. they go to the prison library what? once every couple of weeks or what? once a week?
well, prima paint certainly displaced the states and state law from this area in a very substantial   to a very substantial extent. i'm curious now. have there been any attempts in congress to overrule prima paint?
  unless he's allowed to counter that add-on.
and   and congress responded to concerns about that very result  
the government's position is that he could seek a writ of mandamus, and if he qualified under the standards for mandamus, then he could obtain relief. this court has already held in the flanagan decision that there's no automatic right of interlocutory review from the denial of counsel of choice, and the court did that in recognition of the fact that either the right could be vindicated at the end of the trial or it's not totally separable from the merits.
it's whether   not whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they say "on the merits," but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they don't say anything at all.
so he's right that it's ultimately not decided by the federal court.
so these   these are reliance damages in a sense.
well, they have also asserted in their briefing that as an independent ground for reversal, the instruction was so standardless that the verdict cannot stand.
that might be one reasonable conclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion  
it looks to me like they split the baby up here. (laughter.)
thank you, mr. mills. mr. kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.
well, your honor, again, i want to   under the clean water act, the states have primary responsibility for the reduction and for the elimination and  
  is a stronger  
yes, most certainly. this case represents an egregious use of race in redistricting. without the equal protection clause to protect minority voters, states will have free rein to use race to manipulate not only electoral outcomes, as it did here, but also the complexion of a district in order to be able to express some kind of symbolic  
well, miller-el emphasizes that we need to view the prosecutor's behavior cumulatively. and again, when we look at here the   the prosecutor coming out with one reason after another to try to justify her strikes, consecutive strikes, of the only two black women on this jury, there's just simply no credibility left to give to the demeanor rationale even if one views that it's  
but that's in   in the title vii context, certainly you don't have to show more likely than not to get past the initial threshold. all you have to do is to make four showings that   that federal courts have recognized are rather easily made. so the real show doesn't come until the pretext stage. but it's not that you have to show anything by a preponderance of the evidence, that   you don't have to show discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence under title vii. you just have to show four things from which someone may but not must infer discrimination.
but your answer, both to the justice kennedy and   and to me, ultimately comes down, i guess, to saying that political partisanship alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other motivations, is per se wrong.
and the district court would say i now have a more full, factual record, and i make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there wasn't.
that can't be the test.
would taylor allow us to do that sort of burden shifting?
that   that is correct. during the administrative proceeding and in the   and in the district court, there was no attorney here. but   but i think there's one important thing to keep in mind about that is that that's   congress expected that that would be the result. this is not a statute where congress didn't think about the role of experts. among other things, section  
yes. in this case, it wasn't a million dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount was paid in order to bring the refund suit.
ah, or the more restrictive.
and it has developed that concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to hurt or to stigmatize. here, there is stigmatization going on as between black and white, when we say there is a value in mixing them up. therefore, why should that same concern about referring to race at all be applied in this case.
why not?
  is it in your interest to ask us to apply rule 11? you're hoping that, in future cases, it will be less likely that these are awarded?
mr. fermino?
what they've decided is that, in looking at aggravating and mitigating circumstances together, they can't determine, one way or the other, whether aggravators outweigh mitigators or mitigators  
you have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about, namely just children, not parents. now why should i read that it way?
this was a long-term relationship. but what happened in this particular case is the level of violence escalated substantially immediately before the gun shows. the violence had been bruising where you couldn't see it. suddenly it   it escalated with a gun in the face and a split lip and a sudden threat to the children that we're going   if i kill you, i'm going to have to kill your children. so even   even though it had gone on for a while, it suddenly changed, and her state of mind suddenly changed because what was most important to her was the safety of her children. and so she did what she thought she had to do in order to save her children and keep them safe. and it simply would not be fair that if she had done the less blameworthy action, that she has   is more advantaged in court. so you can't square the way duress is treated and the way self-defense is treated.
no.
well, supposing we've got a license inspector or somebody every monday night to go out and   and inspect very heavily the competitor and cause all sorts of nuisance values and so forth. but he's a state official, induced to do that by some kind of bribery or fraud on the part of the defendant. would there be a cause of action there or not?
if the  
but the actual  
does   does   would virginia allow the   a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised on collateral review for a failure of counsel to   to advise the client or take action on the client's behalf under the virginia convention   the vienna convention during   during the   the direct proceedings?
well, that's their strong point. so what is the response to that? because you can easily get two juries in different parts of the country to decide absolutely opposite things as to what the label should say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're in an impossible situation and that's why congress passed this statute, to be sure it would be epa and not two juries in different places.
the definition again on 3a includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable change in the terms. and so it's not settled whether  
i think the answer is no, your honor, although that   although that would be a closer case  
the question is that's   one witness is all you had. would there be a crime against the law of mississippi and if so, what would it be?
so the state would permit more fishing than the u.s. would allow  
so  
the government.
well, i think this is a manifestation of the principle articulated in earls and repeated in hazelwood that a, school does not have to tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic educational  
well, your honor, i don't think we need to go that far. i   i think we could look at given types of accommodations and say if a legislative determination is made that this type of accommodation with respect to this type of request is appropriate, based on a balancing of all the factors to consider in that particular case  
yes, your honor. yes, your honor, that is right.
in   i'm sorry, your honor.
but there would  
but   i'm sorry. maybe this is something everybody knows but me. but i would have thought that a national association is distinct from a corporation in a way, for example, that a partnership is distinct from a corporation. and i wouldn't have assumed that the laws with respect to corporations automatically applied to national banking associations. but you say they do?
your honor, respectfully, this court has been looking the other way on strawbridge for 200 years, and what congress did was ratify some of your previous abrogations of strawbridge and they made another minor adjustment. and you know what it   what did they did is, again, consistent with 200 years of friendliness to defendants in federal court. the whole notion of diversity jurisdiction  
there is no baseline level of protection that is available by statute or civil service protections. if the court recognizes that the speech involved here, exposing government misconduct and so on, is important for first amendment purposes, as it has previously recognized, then it's   then it needs to be a baseline level of first amendment protection. and then if whistle-blower statutes are passed that protect it beyond the baseline level, that's fine. i'm not maligning whistle-blower statutes. but there is no such level of protection that is guaranteed. for someone in his position, if the first amendment does not protect his speech, it's just not protected. and i want to get back to   i started to say why it's so important that the speech be protected. it's not just that the public needs to have a government of public servants, but the government needs to know how it's operating. how can government function efficiently and effectively if it does not possess the information it needs to make responsible choices? when an employment decision is actually made because the employee has made a bad judgment and he reached an unwarranted conclusion in his memo, or the manner in which he conveyed it was terribly indiscrete, he publicized in front of the whole sheriff's department, and embarrassed them, when that's an issue, then the employment can respond, and the courts will make quick   short shrift of those cases, as they do now.
no. but i mean, does the state or the feds own the   the river that goes through it?
and that's what gives rise to the problem in the case.
that's not the  
i think it would depend. some jurors might take away that the person  
but the   i guess the problem is if   if we start with the assumption that i made a second ago that your reading is not a necessity   it's a possible reading. no question about it. but if   if we assume that it's not an absolute necessity, we   we try to avoid freakish results, and this seems like a freakish result. and i take it your answer is it may be a freakish result. we're not claiming that congress intended it. but that still leaves us, i think, with the problem of a   a reading which is not absolutely necessary that does produce a freakish result. and if that's the case, why shouldn't you lose?
two answers if i can, your honor. first of all, i think this court has answered that question with respect to waste management more than a hundred years ago in the california reduction case. it was clearly held there the provision of waste management services is an essential function that governments appropriately provide. so that's been answered here. with respect to this question about hamburgers and other services that look commercial, i think there are two checks on those kinds of ordinances. first of all, i think it is very likely that in most circumstances if you were to say that hamburgers will be sold at a government operated facility, that that would disadvantage local interests significantly, and there would be a political process check. secondly the court has been clear that it is not bound by formalistic distinctions in the commerce clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the court has said, forthright or ingenious. so if case were to present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to believe that the motive of a government entity was, in fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict scrutiny might be appropriate.
no. i think the key difference is  
  they're not there  
if he had intended to hit the police officer, was it  
instead, what we have here is a fight about whether it's a good iep or no iep.
and there was a footnote dicta.
but she can do that by advising the police, and then there's probable cause. or, if the husband's there, there are probably exigent circumstances.
no?
it's very  
the other thing that  
that is exactly the kind of policy decision that the local governing authority makes about taxes. actually the petitioner has a footnote explaining the origin of fractional tax valuation. indeed, it seems to be consistent with some of the history also that we've seen that there would be informal adjustments of valuations to take into account perhaps poverty, or to take into account less meritorious justifications. and the   because of the perception or, i believe petitioner calls it the political psychology perhaps, of having such a high rate, that is a policy decision that different taxing authorities make. it should not mean that guam surrenders two-thirds of its debt limitation. congress did not use the word assessed and it's a very difficult argument to adopt that by failing to use assessed, they limited it to an assessed value that surrendered two-thirds of the guam territorial debt limitation contrary to all  
yes.
thank you, counsel. ms. lewis.
they decided  
but if it's a case involving a ferc license, and ferc isn't there, i think it says a great deal.
okay. now, if   if the   if the   if it is the validity of arrest, which   which is in issue, i don't see why your rule is going to make any difference in the long run unless we go the further step and say, in order to make this work, i.e., enforce fourth amendment values, at the time of the arrest the cause has got to be stated. am   am i missing something?
well, your honor, i would disagree, because the upper term, the statutory maximum in booker would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no justification offered by the trial court  
but what if he simply goes to the public and says, "look, there's brady material here, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my boss is telling me to suppress it." that wouldn't be turning over his work product. and i took it, from what you said earlier, that, in that case, you would say at least he gets pasts step one of pickering for the  
  isn't that exactly the   what the act does? that's  
your honor, there are other cases that i'm aware of in texas where the state did challenge jurors on this basis. whether there was any questioning   any difference in questioning, i don't know. it's not apparent from the records.
yes.
justice breyer, our understanding is that the fourth, fifth, and sixth circuits, including the decision below, have all come to the conclusion that the ultimate decision of when to issue the mandate lies within the broad discretion of the court of appeals.
  your honor, in our state it's a designated use  
another that might work is   is requiring in death cases that it be a   a plausible ground or something like that. i want to know your opinion of how to deal with that circumstance.
but isn't it true that it falls squarely within the word "transmission," just exactly as an automobile accident arising out of carrying   transmitting mail does?
no. no, i don't think so, your honor. now, first of all, just to be clear, the   the fee provision that's at issue here is identical to the fee provision that was at issue in casey, and it makes no reference to expenses. it says attorneys' fees as part of the costs. now, in this separate section instructing the gao to do a report  
it's a criminal trial.
we believe that what my client seeks is much less than what police officers do every day. we would ask this court to hold that ms. gonzales was entitled to an objective, reasoned and good faith consideration of her complaint of a restraining order violation, and a good faith assessment of probable cause.
has the honduran government offered to arrest and extradite that witness from honduras to bring him back to the united states?
that may be what he thought, not the officer  
  the idea was   i think what the tenth circuit failed to recognize was that adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to somebody who illegally reentered before iirira, at least before 1994. and what judge mcconnell presumed was that it would have been available. and his point was that even if it would have been available, it's farfetched to think that somebody would have thought not only about coming into the country, but coming into the country and then meeting a united states citizen, and become married to the united states citizen, and using that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying the law retroactively to somebody who had come in beforehand. but i think that was based on a misimpression about the availability of adjustment of status. now, i'd like to address, briefly, if i could, the argument at step one of the landgraf inquiry concerning the negative inference the petitioner seeks to draw from the "before or after" clause   so-called "before or after" clause. and the two provisions can be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the government's brief, and that's in the body of the government's brief. the fundamental flaw with the argument at step one is that the "before or after" clause in the old provision, which is at the bottom of page 2, referred, by terms, to the date of the ina's enactment. now, what we've reflected is the codified version, which refers specifically to the date of june 27 of 1952. but even the ina itself referred to the date of the enactment of this act, which can only be seen to refer to the ina itself. so, if this language had been carried forward in section 1231(a)(5), it still would have been a reference to the date of the enactment of the ina. so, it would refer to somebody who was deported before or after 1952. now, i think, as justice alito suggested, the probable reason that congress decided not to carry forward this language is because the question of whether someone was deported before or after 1952 doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at this point in time. but whatever one might think was the actual reason for congress's failing to carry forward the language, i don't think that you can draw any negative inference from congress's failure to carry forward that language, at least certainly not the negative inference that petitioner wants to draw. in fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if one were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5) applies only to people who were deported initially after 1952. but that sort of negative inference wouldn't be of much assistance to petitioner, or any other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered before iirira, at least as a practical matter, because everybody, i think, in that category, would have illegally reentered   or would have been deported after 1952, rather.
not  
so   so your view  
may i ask just one other question about the   the purpose you're trying to achieve? is it to protect the two inmates who are first celled together from fighting with one another, or is it to avoid the danger that one of them will somehow start a riot later on in   in the general prison population?
well, i think the reason there's no need for one is because a defendant can come in and if he really believes that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue that type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding. and he can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to proffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't understand  
justice breyer, you are correct on the first part, but not on the second part, and that's because oregon supreme court unanimously has construed oregon's law on mitigation to say that what the oregon legislature intended was to have as mitigation only those pieces that are required by the eighth amendment.
no, no, but they're saying if telecommunications and something else is involved, and that's what you offer, you are not offering a telecommunications service. that's their definition of "offer," as "offer telecommunications service separately." it would be obvious, for example, if you service were by phone, to connect with the library of congress and you owned the library of congress, as well as owning the dedicated line. then what you're doing is selling information across the line. so they say that's what they're doing, but just not as much.
your honor, the official congress enacted the westfall act against the presumption of regularity of federal officials and that is of course what this court has often said as well, and so i don't think we should construe the statute on the presumption that the attorney general would, would certify ridiculous cases.
yes. yes , unless   unless   unless subject to federal approval.
go ahead.
justice stevens, there is such a statute. there's a statutory provision that gives the authority. it had been with the   with the director of central intelligence. the recent intelligence reform act has transferred it to the director of national intelligence. but it gives a requirement that the   that   that the director protect sources and methods. i think that that   that statutory provision is consistent with the general notion behind the totten doctrine, but i don't think it's  
would you dispute that in some of the earlier cases, like dembiczak with the garbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this tsm test was applied in a way that seemed to ask for something quite explicit in the prior art?
well, i   i think   i mean, i think there is   i don't think it's a boundless theory. i think you have to keep in mind that this program in pennsylvania was   it's implemented as a last resort. i mean, the prisoners that this regulation applies to are a narrow class of 40 prisoners who have been the most violent and most disruptive  
mr. minear, i'm   i'm not sure i agree with you that   that that language, facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the earlier   of the earlier grant, namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife. surely one   one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.
well, no, it doesn't, justice scalia, but let me respond in two ways. first of all, i think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.
but it applies in the reception center area for someone who has been transferred as well as the   an initial incarceration.
that's correct.
it is not, and it seems as though, looking at the language that the magistrate judge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that he was looking to me, to mr. fry, to meet that burden. and i quoted his language in my brief and to the ninth circuit and i argued to the ninth circuit that the burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to mr. fry. however, that issue was simply not addressed in the ninth circuit's opinion.
correct, your honor.
well, if the employee is simply voluntarily arriving earlier than  
i suppose it might be an abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and took   and decided that there was merit to the plaintiff's claim, and then decided, "well, now i'm going to just throw it out on limitations," might be an abuse of discretion.
we   we just let him off 25 because we're   we're sympathetic to his present state? 1 i thought that mitigation means that it reduces the guilt 2 of the offense at the time that he commits it.
justice kennedy, with respect, that is not a fair description of the federal circuit's test, and i will take you to the language that addressed this claim. it's at the bottom of page 18 of our brief and also at the top of 19, and we quote the solicitor general's brief. the solicitor general asserts to the contrary, that federal circuit precedent focuses attention exclusively on a search for teaching, suggestions and motivations in the prior art. that is not accurate. that was a quote from their brief. here is a quote from the solicitor general. it is from a new opinion of the federal circuit, but it is quoting, it is citing a series of old opinions from the federal circuit. under our nonrigid motivation, suggestion, teaching test, a suggestion to combine need not be found in the prior art. and then there is the blocked quote that i read to justice breyer about making things cheaper, faster, lighter, common knowledge and common sense.
am i wrong about that?
when is the last time you read legal notices in a newspaper?
  your honor, and that is not  
yes.
oh, okay.
it clearly set up parallel systems of litigation. it did not discuss the question of what happens in the second litigation, but i think that this court in england decided the proper solution to a situation where the federal law requires  
final action or failure to.
  the nature   the appointing authority and so forth. but so far as the rights of the defendant at the proceeding  
he was either in school or he wasn't in school.
  no waiting time. they didn't decide "if" waiting time   "which" waiting time. but they said no   it's irrelevant whether it's before or after, because waiting time isn't covered. so, i don't see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is covered, but not  .
justice souter, the reason it raises a constitutional problem is because of the content discrimination issue. what the state is saying is that you have a right to collect an agency fee that is the full equivalent of union dues, but if you choose to spend any money from your treasury for electoral advocacy, you may spend whatever you want from your treasury for   for legislative lobbying, for public relations, for all kinds of other issues, forms of speech that are not chargeable to objectors. but if you choose to spend any for one particular type of speech, namely electoral advocacy, then you must segregate and refund a portion of the  
well, but that did not convey with the property. it had to be reassigned in order for mr. robbins to take advantage of that right-of-way.
exactly, absolutely, at the time of the state court decision. in fact, if you look at the language of 2254(d)(1) it says "resulted in a decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. it doesn't say "is contrary to clearly established law." it says "was contrary to."
well, i think   i think we were communicating. swann was a case where there was de jure discrimination. bakke was a university case. this is a different case.
well, he certainly wouldn't have the death sentence. that was   is solely as to the guilt part of the case, justice scalia?
your honor  
it meant something else. what is the something else?
  one way   if i'm having trouble, i'll just read it.
justice ginsburg, there is another remedy, which is certainly governed by a much shorter statute of limitations. but in my view, the equities or the facts of the case should not drive the construction of the statute, any more than it did in united states versus williams. and if 1346 is broad enough to encompass a third party case in the instance of a lien, it is broad enough to encompass it in the case of a levy. there is no functional substantive difference between money taken from a   from a third party via a lien or via a levy.
no. i would, with respect, mr. chief justice, i would disagree with that. there still needs in our view to be some allegation that indicates   a factual allegation that indicates a reason for believing there may have been unlawful agreement.
yes.
among other things that went on were they hired private detectives to go after her, to keep her from the bed. i mean, you've read that opinion and there are like about 30 things in there. and i grant you that one of those things is the fact that three pages of the living trust, according to the judge, were created after the event of that trust and slipped in without his knowledge. i mean, it's quite a story.
suppose you lost on that one. suppose that you wanted some kind of a   suppose that the majority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely frivolous filings on the basis of   of statute of limitations. would you   what standard would   what   what's our choice of standards there? could we   one, obviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith. another could be he has to be in good faith and there has to be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run. maybe there are others that you've thought of.
yes.
  our petition  
what i'm driving at is   and i think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a new jersey case, perhaps   that is it the same burden of proof whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an initial placement or a change of  
i would say not, because housing decisions are inherently private, unlike public education. and there's no way to know how those benefits are being distributed, if they're going to be comparable. i would say no, it is not comparable to the schools.
well, actually, the disagreement   there wasn't any disagreement. he came forward and exposed police misconduct. and his supervisors were on his side.
but i   i guess that's where i went wrong. i thought those were the reasons that he was claiming that he had been distressed emotionally.
  honor, because  
that's exactly what happened here. what  
justice ginsburg, i don't think it presents a double jeopardy bar, but a defendant has a right to be present at his trial, and so it certainly would be a reversible error if   if a trial judge  
well, certainly, justice o'connor, we've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment is still there. it is still in existence. we've not yet collected on it. but i don't believe that mootness turns on whether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment. there are very few cases out there in which a party has, in fact, obtained two judgments, one from a state court and one from a federal court, usually because a party waived the application of preclusion doctrines. and   and we have conceded previously that that's not our interest. what is our interest here is that we have asserted federal jurisdiction. this case was brought in federal court by sabic. during the course of discovery, we found some things out that they had been overcharging us and we indicated that we were going to bring claims against them in federal court. they ran down to delaware court by forum shopping in order to try to obtain a shorter statute of limitations, which turned out for them to be a strategic blunder of monumental proportions. but the federal case, when we filed it, those claims had original jurisdiction in federal court. they have not yet been resolved in a proper way. we  
but then there's   but then there's  
the constitutionality of the statute with regard to the union's first amendment rights is not at issue here, your honor, no.
it's arguably different than the good-time credits at issue in balisok, as   as your honor notes. however, i   i would suggest that even with respect to good-time credits, often under many state systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially   and in some states, it doesn't even have an effect on the  
your honor, it was about mootness and the result of the   the government's complaint there was that it was going to have to live with the collateral estoppel effects of the judgment. one of the arguments they made was, well, because we can't get an appeal, we won't be bound, and the court disagreed with that en route to saying, and to avoid that problem, precisely that problem, you should have asked for vacatur. but since the solicitor general didn't do it, the court   the decision stood and it had collateral estoppel effect. that   that is the holding of munsingwear, your honor.
yes. i   i  
the   it's   the full faith and credit act requires that you   requires that you apply the preclusion law of the state that rendered the judgment to which  
well, i think that that is true, to some extent, justice souter, but i do think that   at least with regard to the question of what factors are relevant to the ultimate determination, that is governed by a quite different statutory provision. and the oregon supreme court construed that provision to limit the mitigating factors that the jury can take into account to those that are mandated by the eighth amendment.
there is   there's another form of relief that  
as long as it's under $100.
so you quite clearly have both. i understand that. let me ask you a question about the   the preemption point because what i think they're saying is go read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory requirements, regulation. and i think one of their claims is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without any change in the regulatory, that   that it was violated. these are false. they're misbranded. so we are not imposing a requirement different from or in addition to the requirement of federal law. we are enforcing a requirement that is the same as the requirement of federal law, and if, by the way, the epa were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a regulation to that effect. but they haven't. now, what   what is the answer to that argument?
if you have a minute, you might   i don't know if you   if this is very useful. but i've taken this point of view that   that there's no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes in cases like this, a perfect example. and therefore, the only thing to do, consistent with the constitution, is no peremptories.
there is no statutory equipoise provision. the state has a burden of proof to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the aggravating. that's what you mean by the statutory equipoise provision?
or it could be a reduction in the terms. i mean, these things are statutory construction issues to be litigated, and the important issue here   and they are presented in this case. they're to be litigated and the important issue is that when there is fair debate about these issues insurance companies will not be held to be willfully violating the statute if they got the answer wrong. but i think on the, on the substantive question, it's important to read "adverse action" in light of, if i could just finish the sentence, in light of the definition of when a notice is required to be issued, which turns upon the content of the information in the report. thank you.
thank you, mr. joseffer. mr. prendergast, we'll now hear from you.
the honorable court is now adjourned until monday next at 10 o'clock.
do you know if there's been any instruction in the state of washington to police following that flora decision about taping   about arresting people for taping conversations with police officers?
yes, but it is an important question, because the   there is an amicus brief that says, "go read the statute." and, really, the statute was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a statute about universities in vietnam not letting military people on campus. so, in the   at the heart of the statute was a matter which was unique to the military. now, this is a matter that isn't unique to the military. so, why not interpret the statute in the way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a difficult constitutional question?
what   what  
well, this court has not dealt with that issue and from our purposes  
whether it's single-count or double-count or triple-count. i want to know what   how you see it, not how i see it.
no, but if  
that's fine. i   that's one sort of relief. but, i mean, you have some relief at issue under every statute. they want a needy person to be given justice. and to say that, since that's their purpose, you should always put the burden on the other side, is   i just don't understand that argument.
under   under   as i understood   as i understood you to define the capital offense, the state could prove the capital offense by saying he did have intent when he killed and he also happened to be committing a crime. am i wrong about that statement of mississippi law?
the current bankruptcy code does not say that. in theory, i  
that in and of itself is not sufficient. that's the point that, the seniority system in lorance was necessarily based upon an earlier decision that the employer  
no, justice souter. there's no   my point is not inadvertence. it's whether they have to say or incant any magic words that they are now invoking their power  
you draw a line between present purposeful discrimination and present knowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly carried forward.
well, that's only true if you consider an appeal to be the response. and that's rather weird, that  
  your friends on the other side say that's not a big deal, because the ada looks only to reasonable accommodations; you can take all those factors into account; and presumably the lower courts would. in other words, they say you're already subject to most of these obligations anyway, and it's just a little bit extra, under the ada.
and i  
thank you, mr. gornstein. mr. thomas.
yes. my principle that i am advocating is that any police error in the execution of a search, or in the accomplishment of a search, bears fruit only in relation to the purpose, or purposes, served by the principle violated. one  
so i want to control the case by having a different appointed counsel.
as i understand the state's argument, they are adopting what justice ginsburg wrote in montana v. egelhoff, that the state, by enacting this rule, has made this a substantive choice to make evidence of mental illness irrelevant. however, arizona did not do that, and arizona did not argue that below. below, arizona argued, repeatedly, that eric clark knew this was a police officer, that eric clark intentionally shot a police officer. on appeal, they argued the same thing. in the appellate decision in this case, by the court of appeals of the state of arizona, the state   i raised a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue. and this is in the joint appendix at   one   if i could have one moment   begins on page 330 of the joint appendix   336, and proceeds through the court's discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, in paragraph 17. the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude   and it states, "reasonable inference thereupon that clark knowingly and intentionally shot moritz, and knew that he was a police officer when he did so." there's repeated references that the arizona court of appeals did not understand that arizona had somehow, by adoption of the mott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first-degree murder, and   as it   we point in our opening brief, they could not constitutionally do so.
but you named lincoln as the defendant. and i'm looking at your second amended complaint, which says, "lincoln," on information and belief, "is a corporation with its headquarters in dallas, and it is the developer and manager of the property." that's what you alleged in your complaint. you allege that lincoln was the manager   lincoln, whose texas corporation was the manager of the property in question. now, would you   you're saying that that was wrong, and you should have sued somebody else, and the court should cure that for you? that's   it's really bizarre.
  the territory of the united states  
the whole thing.
yes.
a nice turn of phrase, as i recall. (laughter.)
why do you chose to defend this principally on the basis of the spending clause, and not on the basis of what it   what it was, seemed to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the congressional power to raise and support armies.
we   we don't believe the court would have a role in monitoring the fair procedure. it would simply determine whether the procedure that the cia has described in the court record already satisfied minimum standards of   of due process. if the court found that it did not  
that's why  
no, he did not. that's what   but you  
but  
well, your honor, if you'd look at what rule  
but neither did it give any explanation for not carrying it forward.
no, i don't think that the court  
your   your   i   i think first position at least would be that it's never prejudicial. but assume we don't agree with that.
we are, your honor, and   and  
but you concede that the error would always be harmless if you have a trial before a petit jury, and all of the elements are instructed to be found by the jury?
i guess. do you think that the court in the footnote misstated bazemore and that therefore we should trust to bazemore and not the subsequent explanation?
yes. yes. well, that's the way the arizona rule is drafted. it can go to   if we can convince the trier of fact that it   that his delusions prevent him from knowing the nature and quality of his acts, if that was actually included in our statute. but, in our case, we were limited to trying to prove his delusional behavior, his delusional beliefs that the officer was an alien, to show that he did not know right from wrong. and that was it. and that places the burden on us, which runs counter to the fundamental principles of criminal law that are set down in winship, that it's the state's burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, every element, including this element, and not without any opportunity of the defense to rebut that element.
it doesn't matter in this case, does it? is   is that issue before us?
  patent holder take the position that, "i   sooner or later, i'm going to have to fight out validity with someone, and might as well do it sooner rather than later, so i am not going to raise the license as a defense"? would that be a "case or controversy"?
why is that, why is that so? why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the guideline   what the guideline would indicate? and if a federal court would say, if i sentence within the guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many courts have held. not this court yet. that would be presumptively valid. and if i go outside, i have to give a reason that will survive appellate review. well, why isn't the middle sentence identical in function to the federal sentencing guidelines advice?
your honor, i think, to the extent that this court can avoid addressing the constitution about constitutionality of a statute   and, in the situation of waiver, we believe that it can   then we believe that's the appropriate jurisprudence.
  always be  
  of analysis?
no, i don't   i don't see your   your logic there. of course, it protects the succession process, but it does not follow that everything that implicates a succession process falls within the probate exception.
so if the district court got it right and the ninth circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? in other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved   gave a proper charge, then the ninth circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.
yes, but  
but one thing i  
so, in this case  
do they have any obligation to inquire whether he is? and   and can you be more specific? should it happen  
but unreasonable.
well, the test, i mean in this case, the specific claim at issue in this case is very analogous to the claim that this court considered in the anderson's-black rock case. what we have in this case is no dispute as to any of the factual inquiries that have traditionally defined patent validity analysis. the prior art that we rely on, it's undisputed that it's prior art and it's in the record. the level of skill is undisputed. the quantum of difference between the claimed subject matter and the prior art is undisputed. the only issue in this case is what legal consequences follow from that. what question do you ask to decide whether or not that difference adds up to a patentable invention? it's very analogous to what was going on in the anderson's-black rock case. anderson's-black rock was a case like this in which someone had invented a radiant heat burner and the patentee in that case had seen that there was a market for using that by attaching it to an asphalt spreader. so the patent claim in that case was taking someone else's invention, the radiant heat burner and hanging it on a standard painting apparatus and using it for its, one of its marketable purposes. this court held in this, in the anderson's-black rock case that the patentee had not done anything patentable in that case. all he had done was take a burner that functioned as a burner, and a spreader that functioned as a spreader, and the two components did not affect one another's operation at all. it was in the parlance of this court's precedents, an aggregation.
leaving that out made it erroneous because it said, not with respect to reprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable relationship. that was erroneous.
well, but they put a gloss on the rule by their decision.
may i  
well, even if   i'm willing to assume that. how does that guarantee that the out-of-state winery will not, in violation of new york state law, ship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers, just simply bypassing its cache of wine in new york?
we want to know what the rule is.
in the prior case? i would say no, your honor. first, because as i mentioned, the issue of eligibility within the monetary limits was never raised below. and in fact, if you look at his schedules in the supplemental joint appendix, he is clearly within the statutory limits based   just looking at his schedules.
and that's what, it seems to me, is going on here.
  have jeering  
i   i can't see why that makes any sense at all. i mean, she   she was either testifying when she spoke and then signed the affidavit, as evidence of her testimony, or   or else she wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit and the oral statement should be in. i can't   i can't see drawing the line between those two. it really seems very strange to me.
  have to decide  
it   it would be a logistical problem, your honor, of  
but the judge never said, under any other circumstances, i will not appoint counsel.
well, the  
the factor (k), as the entire standard instruction given in these cases, recites verbatim the language of the california statute, which is california penal code section 190.3. and, interestingly enough, the   not only the california supreme court, but this court, implicitly has   have both said that not only the california statute, but the instruction   this standard instruction, upon   which is based on the statute, do allow consideration of all relevant mitigating factors. in fact, as far back as 1983, in this court's california v. ramos decision, this court stated, albeit in dicta, that the factor (k)   or that the standard instruction would allow consideration of background and character evidence; and, in fact, the court stated, in footnote 20  
well, what would be okay? how would you get there other than having   the point i'm trying to make has been made by others. let me read from judge boudin's decision. he says: "the choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device." if you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.
so it doesn't depend on motive or targeting or anything at all. it just depends on the fortuity of there being two competitors in a particular area.
no. i think what is constitutionally  
i understand. but it goes to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the imminent harm is. if, in fact, the 6 percent will only be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few years, your  
he was. so, he would have clearly met that eligibility criteria   there is no question about that   under the pre-existing law. but if you put yourself in the position of somebody who is entering, pre-iirira, and is trying to determine whether suspension of deportation is relief that would be realistically available to them, you'd have to think that they would act on   in reliance on their ability to stay in the country for 7 years, and to remain undetected, only at which point they would qualify for suspension of deportation. and that not only seems to me, as a factual matter, somewhat farfetched, but it's not clear that the law should attach significance to that sort of reliance  
i mean, we   we insist that the deterrence somehow be related  
  "constitute"  
i'm talking about a fee. i'm trying to   oh, fine. if there's no fee charged and i didn't pay the $100 and i didn't pay anything else, you'd give me the decal. but you said you wouldn't.
well, no. that was, there was an existing case or controversy there. that wasn't a freestanding cause of action. none of these cases are freestanding. davis versus passman, different.
it doesn't say that in the statute. it suggests the contrary. so what is the particular provision of new hampshire law that tells that   i mean, the doctor   all these things are, you know, questions of probability. and he doesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't want to risk losing his license. and so what particular provision   he happens to have his lawyer with him. (laughter.)
would that qualify as attempted burglary?
that's correct, because otherwise it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful limitation. but again, it's important to understand here the tax court judge did not exercise his authority in this case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's findings. he could have done so  
yes. it's about an amount in-controversy rule.
except if they heard so much of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought they couldn't consider what they heard?
well, then   then   well, i'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are really not saying that there has to be probable cause.
so you say that payment doesn't   on account of doesn't modify payment.
and, again, i still don't see how you distinguish (b) when you say "(b) doesn't apply here, it may apply in other cases." if it doesn't apply here, why would it apply in other cases?
but i don't think i   let me be clear. we don't need to win that case in order to win this case, because in this case  
that's right.
but it also  
oh, well   right. i'm sorry. then you go ahead. i thought i heard you say that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the parent can't go to court.
be respectful anyway.
that already happens, justice kennedy. in all the circuits that recognize that attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims, that already happens. and that has not cause any disaster or any problem. it's been a practice for 100 years. if congress had wished to change the practice, it would have when it codified the bankruptcy code in 1979. the fact that it hasn't perceived it to be a problem demonstrates that congress wanted to leave the practice unchanged. now, what happens, though, again, justice kennedy, is that creditors don't bother to file claims for those amounts. and where it matters is in cases where it should matter, like in this case, in the pg&e case, where a solvent debtor is simply trying to get out of its contractual relationships. and under principles of absolute priority they are not allowed to do that for the benefit of shareholders where creditors are not being paid in full. and i think it's important to underscore again, justice kennedy.
no, but the   the includes  
  it was assumed california  
  i have to say that the language   you're saying that the language   yes, could it conceivably be   be interpreted in   on   that broadly. but that's not  
well, i mean  
i thought that that was about does the   does the act cover religion or   or does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race, or does anti-semitism count as race. i thought that's what was all that was decided.
well, i   i think there was serious doubt and that's borne out by defense counsel's question to the voir dire. he said to the   during the voir dire to the panel, you either do or will know that mr. deck is restrained, and i guess that's what happens when you're convicted. that's a rough paraphrase. but the either   the part that he said, you either do or will know, that's a direct quote. so defense counsel himself was not even necessarily  
well, if that's   if that's the case, then, on your own reasoning, you can't assume that there's   that availability requires any reasonable availability. it's got to be availability as, i guess, a physical possibility, and that's all.
well, justice stevens, i would say, to the   i think, the main thrust of your question, no, which is to say that if what you have in mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate campus, i think the military would take the position that that's not equal in scope. now, if there's a way, though  
well, let me explain it this way, your honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective whether or not there is a factor required in order to say that something is   that the end point is reasonable, or if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's not   it's not necessary for our argument because our position is that even if a factor is required  
no.
it's the claim on the treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign immunity issues.
and she's   she's in ongoing   the operator is in ongoing contact with the people she's   the operator has dispatched. right?
can   can a trial judge exclude defense evidence based on credibility determinations?
that's correct.
  you're describing the present importance of the   that. but i don't think you've answered my question about historic   as a matter of history, we don't have a history of timer claims.
i know that it's a handwritten one. but that that   that shows how long he has to appeal. is there a date when the order was put on the docket? does that show on this sheet?
  should we send it back for   if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do the same with respect to out-of-staters?
and why is it not ambiguous if the author of the conference report read it that way?
well, i'm happy for you to rely on the joint statement, your honor. my only point is, is that the understanding in the house report is expert fees were included in the house bill, which referred to costs and expenses. senator weicker explains precisely the question you asked, which is what happened to the senate bill. and senator weicker's explanation, which was made before the senate, immediately before the senate voted on the bill, makes clear that expert costs are included. then, of course, you have the bill going to conference. there were many changes in the bill, including the language of section 1415. prior to the conference, it did not say attorneys' fees as part of costs. it said attorneys' fees in addition to costs. that language was changed in conference to accommodate this court's decision in marek v. chesny, which had to do with the applicability of rule 68.
no, but isn't that the problem in your argument? because your argument assumes, and i think you said this quite candidly a moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he informed the court that he did not want mitigation evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of   binds him as a matter of law for all time. and what he is saying here is look, if i had known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end of the trial in fact, i would not have made that waiver, if you want to call it that. i would not have made that representation to the court. and what i want is an evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, when i said to the court no mitigating evidence, i didn't mean this. and he wants a hearing for that. the only way it seems to me that you can properly win on the issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that i think you said a moment ago. that once there is a finding that he made a statement, whatever its predicate, a statement that i don't want any mitigating evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a matter of law. my question is, do you have any authority for that?
okay. i'll read it.
well, in the sense that viereck was not directly  
the  
you don't dispute that   that it's a very small percentage of people who have ira's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.
in 106(a). it's  
justice kennedy, under michigan law, as i understand it, there is no distinction any longer. the action to determine title under michigan compiled law 600.2932 seems to telescope and subsume both of those common law causes of action into one. unless there are further questions from the court, i would like to reserve the balance of my time. thank you.
so really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. you're concerned with the fact it's a ship.
that's  
it has  
why   why?
no, your honor. it's across ipos and across underwriters. they changed their business. they all changed the business at about the same time: this is the way we're going to operate. we're going to require the laddering orders. that moves the price up. and we're going to require another type of tie-in agreement that allows the underwriters to participate in the customer's profits from the difference between the ipo price and the inflated prices at which transaction sales were made right after the ipo.
but you are saying if congress passes a statute and they put the words co2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the epa doesn't do it, you're saying congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's article iii we're talking about?
thank you, mr. fisher. the case is submitted.
they were not treated as covered enterprises.
and no money damages as well, and that's what distinguishes this case.
if i may answer the question, your honor. well, the only finding that the court has to make under (b)(4) is that the defendant is incompetent. that automatically will exclude the time going forward until the defendant is restored to competency.
well, no conflict is required, for instance, under the jackson transit analysis. the analysis is, is this a pervasively federal regime to start with, and if so, it's a federal claim whether there's a conflict or not. and so a conflict is really unnecessary. but the other point is that with the  
  how does the policeman  
yes.
these are instructions not about how to make something. they are instructions about what the other things that are made should do and how they do it.
and is the preservation of a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling governmental objective?
was  
see, it really  
the obverse of the proposition i put at first, it must be true that there are some instances in which the state can prohibit a procedure even if it is the safest procedure.
okay.
in this case.
  it doesn't matter.
it's a   it's forbidden to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.
how do you get that out of the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?
well, with respect, justice stevens, if you took a look at the controlled substances act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in schedule i substances. but the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market   illegal market, albeit   but market in marijuana in the united states, on an annual basis. so  
there's nothing  
they have to show that it is likely, your honor. and they haven't even tried to make that showing. the one thing that they've  
and i think your formulation is actually a fair one. does it raise some  
since you barely cite aedpa, i think you assume we need to reach the teague question before the aedpa question.
yes, one and two.
but nobody does  
that is what gets plugged into  
i think both, ultimately. i mean, i don't think  
your honor, there was no response from the prosecutors. there was no objection made, no specific objection made as to   as to the state's exercise of a jury shuffle. but in this case to ask this   what   what miller-el is asking this court is to assume that the only discernible trait that could have been the basis for the state's exercise of a jury shuffle is race, and that is not   that is not the case.
but there's no commerce clause reason?
that's part of   this is a suite like hartman v. moore. one of the acts that is clearly actionable under bivens, if one has to dissect the various predicate acts, is the fact that without probable cause, at page 71 of the joint appendix, they deliberately fabricated a felony charge.
well  
what's your position on the jury instruction? does it correctly state the law?
that's correct, your honor. and  
i think the question, or at least the version i have of it  
in a purely advisory system, the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and maximum. and as this court has said in cunningham, if the court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and maximum, then the factual finding as to where within that is up to the district court. it's only when we establish thresholds as the guidelines do we run into the constitutional problem.
well, why not in the case of an acquittal? there's still a violation of the sixth amendment. maybe you don't have an appeal, but you have a 1983 action. right? because your constitutional rights have been violated because, although you won, you didn't win with the counsel of your choice. and if   your personal autonomy interests have been quashed.
i thought i expressed my position there.
so, isn't the right thing for us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back? if you're right that they have to pay, whether they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might win. but should we decide those grounds today? why?
the secretary's.
it was newspapers, and the fbi agents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly disclosed prior to mr. stone's filing of the action.
no, of course not in the habeas context. i'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word "core operative fact"? or would we? i'm not as familiar with this as you. what is the answer?
  that the police asked the question, and then the trial judge said the   what blake said was an answer to that question.
yes.
well, maybe   maybe it contemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that that particular   that particular argument against it   i.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption   would not have been an argument against it. but it doesn't follow, from that, that the tribe would necessarily have had a winning argument on a preemption theory.
  whether the police initiated the conversation that produced the confession.
okay. even if the court concludes that the trial judge did credit the demeanor rationale, it's still a wholly unpersuasive reason to give in light of everything else the prosecutor did here. the demeanor rationale wasn't the sole reason given. it comes as part of a litany of reasons that are all either unconstitutional, the gender rationale, or contradicted or unsupported by the record. and there was some discussion earlier about this. miller-el makes clear that the district attorney must give the real reason for the strike, not just any rational basis the prosecutor can think up. and when we look at the transcript of the batson hearing here, we see a prosecutor scrambling to think of anything she  
that's true with respect to the executive determination. but the icj's decision went beyond its authorizing statute and explicitly   even though its authorizing statute says the icj has jurisdiction only to speak to the matter directly before it, in paragraph 151 the icj said it wasn't speaking just to the matter before it.
and what the new policy says is, committee, you must give the prisoner some information. then it refers to form 2598. form 2598 is the form on page 58.
yes, i understand all that. but  
so you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have this scheme. in other words, it has nothing to do with whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy. then you'd say that could be something that's not covered by the "just and reasonable" provision? official
i don't think that it is fair, your honor. i don't want to pretend to be an expert on global climate change. but the one thing i can say is from the materials i looked at is that this an extraordinarily complex area of science. i'm not aware of any studies available that would suggest that the regulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas emissions would have any effect whatsoever on the global    
  measures to try to police the matter closely.
is   is that the case here too? one of the things that's neither here nor there i guess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that i would have thought that the lesser-included offense on   on the theory that the   that he didn't intend to kill, he was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and shot and so on   i would have thought the lesser-included offense was a heat of passion kind of killing. but as   as i read the   the statement of   of simple murder, which requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like it. and i   i read negligent homicide, and that didn't sound like heat of passion. but is   is it your point here, if   if we get into it, that as long as you asked for some lesser-includeds, under mississippi law that raises the issue adequately?
i don't know that i would, but i think the caveat to that is if the federal government were running it themselves, pursuant to a different statute than we have here, the first thing i think i would look at is what jurisdiction or what the congress had to say about where they wanted cases arising from that. it may well be  
that's right, justice ginsburg, it would count for purposes of suspension of deportation, which was renamed cancellation of removal. but that form of relief is available to somebody who's inside the united states, and i was meaning to address the situation where he has voluntarily removed himself from the united states and is seeking admission from, presumably, mexico, in which case, suspension of deportation wouldn't really come into play, because deportation wouldn't be on the table. but, you're right that if he had stayed in the country, suspension of deportation is a form of relief that he would have been eligible for   eligible for, pre-iirira. but, with respect to suspension of deportation, i think it's important to understand that that form of relief required an   a period of presence in the united states of 7 years before one could gain eligibility to seek that relief. and so  
there's a pattern because they hired more than one.
well, i've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards. so i have firsthand knowledge. i mean   and i've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed. i mean, when they come in, they come in.
it is an outside influence, your honor. it is an influence coming from  
well, we know precisely what they did. they kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the   of the search. we know that. there's no   there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.
but isn't it true that at the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of this kind that the court would look at the conference report to ascertain the meaning of the statute? at that time, in 1986.
well, your honor, this system really is   this is just like   this case is just like blakely. what the california supreme court in people against black found, they used references to reasonableness as a label and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of blakely and apprendi. instead they tried to fit the determinate sentencing law within the federal system this court found constitutional in booker. but the california supreme court seriously misread booker. in booker, in the remedial portion of that decision, this court found the federal system to be constitutional by rendering the guidelines   the mandatory guidelines to be advisory. now  
that's correct, your honor.
now, that's exactly   i'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100 percent test, because i don't think they capture all the considerations that are relevant. focus on what you just said. what you've done is you've tried to create an injunction that will separate out the sheep from the goats, all right? the goats are only 1 percent and the sheep   but what does it say? i don't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure, because if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes down the drain your whole parental notification because you can't have parental notification without a bypass procedure. i don't think you can say enjoin emergencies because to do that, you're going to have to get into the greatest difficult issue there is in this area, which is what does that health exception mean. and we've said throughout that that health exception has to be defined first by a legislature. so if you tell me how to write that injunction, then i'll be able to decide whether it's possible for a court just to say, okay, we only enjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature, this is basically up to you, the whole area.
no. no. it said   a pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, afterwards they file, after the petition they file a claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to recover attorneys' fees. and they say that's what we have, we had a contract that gave us this right to attorneys' fees. the fees will be pre- petitioned in nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees were incurred. all right. now, what is your response to that?
yes. every robinson-patman case there's ever been has been purchase-by-purchase at the level of  
she was.
okay.
well, but we're talking about inter   we're talking about retailers. it, it seems to me at the outset of the argument, you   you acknowledged, and i think it is the general rule   that if the retailers themselves have this resale price maintenance, it is invalid. well, if the manufacturer does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and that's   many of the examples in your brief, it is for the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? why should we allow the manufacturer to do something we that wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the retailers?
it called it a discretionary appeal, justice scalia, without ever explaining why, and the   the dissent in bulger pointed out the michigan court of appeals is an error-correcting court. and in fact, the very author of the  
yes.
which they did not say in this act.
well, your honor, it   it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action because it could be, for instance, the employee who was the individual who informed the government official charged with responsibility to act of the facts that would warrant the united states in filing an action under 3730(a).
but i thought that didn't go into anything. that was a two-page per curiam, and it was just was there a claim. and it didn't  
of course, if the federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable.
yes, justice o'connor.
  but then there's a walk. what about the walk?
i'm not   i'm asking you  
oh, i'm sorry, your honor. you say he's not acquitted.
and if he said, "i may not be prosecuted under the constitution because," what follows "because," in your view?
  if the judge, at the end of the plaintiff's case, says i'm not sure what the answer is, but there is enough evidence here to submit to the jury, so i'm going to overrule the motion for judgment   judgment at the end of the case. now, that's a different test than you say is appropriate under batson, is it not?
it   it seems to me that   justice breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this court adopted a quarter of a century ago in michigan v. summers. and that's a question of law. to be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be   and obviously the officers' position in this case   is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and   and candidly of the other individuals who were being   being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.
but "in certain"  
do you think we have to amend the lemon test to reach your approach?
well  
so you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not at the jury level?
justice souter, i would   i would not characterize this as a clerical error. congress considered this provision the heart of   of a scheme. this was where  
i have just two, two questions on, on willful and then   because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case. first, you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be reckless. do you have any authority, where we   for that proposition, where we have said that?
  and resolved  
well, if we go further with 921(20), there's another limitation that again clearly deals with states, and that's the restoration of civil rights provision. the government concedes in their brief   and that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the dickerson v. banner institute case   that that applies to state situations. the idea that if a person receives a state pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a disqualifying factor. and they talk about the law of the foreign state being what determines whether it's a conviction or not. now, clearly we're not looking at going to some pardon process in germany or uruguay to decide whether a person still has a conviction. another part of the statute that's very clear, 924(e)(1). that's the armed career criminal section. that section says that if a person's who's convicted under 922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they get 15 years. now, that definition of serious drug conviction is a state or federal conviction. now, let's flip over to 21 u.s.c. 802(44), the drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. there in 802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a state, federal, or foreign drug offense. so we see that congress can differentiate when it wants to. now, they're  
  judge made  
there's  
but that   that puzzles me a little. the   the affidavit says execution will not take place until the event. but the authority to search, which is in the last paragraph, is not limited to the time after the anticipatory event.
do you really think this would be a different case if the officer had a device that did exactly what the dog   dog did?
you may answer the question.
you  
whether the fetus is more than halfway out, and some of these fetuses i understand in the procedure, are only four or five inches long. they are very different from fully formed babies.
because public employee unions are so weak? they're the only strong unions left in the country. i mean, really. [laughter.]
the   the commingling situation is one in which the courts would look to see if the person is still essentially in possession of the funds as the court stated in great-west. we think under that circumstance it would be. i can envision circumstances  
but your   your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they  
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
how would it be as-applied? look at your reply brief at page 3. and you've made it very clear, and i think that it is helpful that you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit. you've talking about this small category of cases, but i take it from what you have read   what the lines i've just read, that you envision a doctor who says, sooner or later, i'm going to have such a case. right now, i don't know and i can't know until it's too late to come to any court, so i'm going to bring this pre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied. but i don't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just says, as you put it, i don't have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring this suit. so what is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would be proper?
and other competitors might have been hurt, but   but the whole purpose of it was to get your client. that is to say, your client was in some special way a target. wasn't that part of your complaint?
well, it is not a correct statement of the law.
no, no. were it an ordinary  
well, justice ginsburg, i   i don't have as good an answer for that as i would like because the   the web site is now defunct. and so maybe mr. bopp can answer that in rebuttal. as i understand it, consistent with what justice breyer said, that there was sort of additional arguments about the feingold record on   on filibusters and senator kohl's record on filibusters, and then there was   there was information about how to contact them. but i think, again, as   as mr. bopp has said, if   if you don't find the broadcast medium a particularly effective way to convey the phone numbers and you have to reference people to the web site anyways, the very fact that you could reference them to the web sites without naming the candidates' names and avoid the strictures entirely seems like the kind of thing that this court had in mind when it said on page 206 that there were ways to deal with this problem prospectively and that you didn't need a as-applied challenge like this one. and again, i think you can't overestimate the difficulties here because  
i don't think any court would conceivably reverse the   the disqualification of counsel on the ground that he would have come up with that defense and win.
yes. but our  
  one   one of the   one of the concerns, i believe, that congress did have with respect to small employers was the fact that in the terms of small employers, you are dealing with less sophisticated litigants, less sophisticated litigants with less access to legal resources that bigger companies have.
that's not   not including 23.
the answer is yes?
  they're exempt from it entirely, which is even better, i suppose.
the great grandson's intent was to get the money as fast as he could, and, in fact, he thinks   when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll give it back to the trust but   at least   yes. that's what he thinks.
would it   would it always be an abuse of discretion for the district court to do this if the state wanted to reach the merits?
there's no way to get any protection against that, no matter how promptly you respond.
  what the law schools are engaging in  
what about offer and acceptance?
is that right?
yes, your honor.
well, if that   that   that's   you're saying that the defendants themselves could not sue now under 1983?
you would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar.
there is a brief from the kansas law professors, and this is the instruction from the kleypas case?
i know, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something like that.
but you can reconcile valley forge simply by saying when it's money from the federal treasury, whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation, it is money from the treasury, and that's what flast is about. because whether it is spent by the executive under an executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program. so why isn't that the line to draw based on flast, that it's money from the treasury that makes the difference?
well, we would certainly have a more difficult argument here if that were the case, your honor. but williams' specific withholding was   didn't answer the question at issue here, because it only held that a person who had been subjected to a lien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346. but it didn't answer the question here, which is whether or not when congress has provided specifically for parties in petitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme that would be wholly frustrated  
if   if  
but the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.
a rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set aside a final judgment denying federal habeas relief on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second or successive petition under aedpa. it can proceed only under aedpa's terms, which change not only the standards for a second decision, but the decision-maker, the gatekeeper. justice souter  
why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?
25, yes. yes, we're talking about 25.
i have just one other question on a different matter. in judge bias's dissent, judge bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from the petitioner, the petitioner does not want to proceed with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled. can you comment on that?
i don't think that's sufficient, because it requires for the facts that particularly show  
there is good reason here, your honor. what's critical about new york's law, as well as michigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol vendor have a physical presence in the state. and that's important for a couple of reasons. the state can't meaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-state entity. petitioner suggested  
no, but you  
under such an indictment, under this case he could not, because he was under the constant surveillance of the ins at the time and in law that is not a legal indictment, not a legal reentry, an illegal reentry. it's one of those quirks in the law, and that's why they charged the attempt, to avoid these questions of whether he was under the constant control and surveillance of the immigration authorities, which he was. he never got by secondary. so that's why the charge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry.
that's where we are in this argument.
that   that would be assuming   that would be assuming that you could take someone who is threatening in that manner at his word. i don't think that's something the officers could   could afford to do.
no. there are two options. one would, of course, be to have an agreement on resolution of the medical claim, which would require notice and involvement of the state. the state could act here. the other option is if they're at loggerheads, for it to be clear up front amongst all the parties that the   the settlement isn't resolving all the third party liability. it   the   the question of liability for medical care, or at least the state's claim for medical care   sometimes they have their own   is still open, and there has to be enough money left in the well. there were two insurance policies here that were paid at their caps.
if there were a health exception  
  for the "place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform."
and we want to consider that.
oh, absolutely  
so it would be an employee benefit program, but not a plan.
yes, city of east cleveland where they had the grandmother and the   the  
no, but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition, i'm not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition.
yes.
suppose there's a dispute in the   in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one - the party was entitled under the contract has been waived. okay? that's the issue. is that issue to be decided by federal law or by state law?
it's our position that they could have, though that's a much closer case. in this case, the officers acted in a very guarded manner. i mean, they   they proceeded and they investigated step by step and, in fact, did not enter until a punch was thrown and there was  
when  
well, the   tell   help me out here. as   as has been explored earlier, the confession referred to   to some of the injuries on the body, but not to all of them. were there   were there other disparities between the confession and   and the   and other evidence?
it's harmless error because he   the evidence of guilt was substantial? what   how does the harmless error work?
but the statute does not say "the finding of any special circumstances found to be true." it says "the existence of any special circumstances found to be true." that's what they're   that's what they're instructed to consider. the existence. in determining the penalty, the trier of fact take into account the following, (a), it says, the "existence" of any special circumstances found to be true; not the "fact" that they were found to be true.
no, your honor. i think what happens is that   that there are the segment of carriers that would like to compete against intrastate carriers. the fact that other carriers may be getting a break in terms of regulatory fees   and we don't know that to be the truth, getting the other interstate carriers. it's the boston stock exchange, and i think it was said again in the scheiner case that   that you can't discriminate among interstate carriers. and as we pointed out in our brief, you could set up a situation in which a   a state discriminated in favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries where their locals had no interest in competing, but where their   their locals were interested in competing, they could set up a discriminatory system. so you can protect timber industry in   in oregon and  
because this court's cases make clear, the wynn, eisenberg case  
right, and that's   that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.
may i ask this question? as i understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation of the knock and announce rule.
your honor, florida does have a rule for a guilty plea, but   and now the florida supreme court says there has to be a colloquy for a strategy decision that   where there's a concession, but we disagree with that. we don't think that there should be a colloquy. we don't think that that   that should be required. and we think that that's problematic and we're already seeing in florida that   that judges, laboring under the nixon decision, are asking questions to defendants as to whether or not all sorts of strategy decisions are decisions they agreed to.
don't you think congress, if congress is concerned about the, in this provision, about the impact of the federal presence, and your reading prevents the money that congress meant to go to those particular districts from actually reaching the districts, i mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read it the way that, let the money get where congress meant it to go?
if you agree with us on question one, justice ginsburg, reversal is the appropriate disposition, and the court need not reach question two. we would submit, however, that, because the error is so egregious and leads to the difficulties that have been outlined by the real estate roundtable for nationwide business entities, that the court certainly ought to say that this was error, as well, or at least to vacate that part of the judgment, as well. and the reason is, in the carden case, what the court held was that the  
i take it the answer is no.
i   and the country seems to have survived that standard. there is innovation. there are problems in the music industry, but it thrives, and so forth. so there is an argument for just following it, because it's what it is. but suppose it's totally open. why should that be the right test, instead of some other test, like substantial use, et cetera?
i think within limits, that's absolutely right, justice kennedy. and the right of counsel of choice, as this court has articulated it in its wheat decision, is far from an absolute right. it's a qualified right that does yield to interests that are designed to protect the fairness of the trial.
you would rather be regulated more aggressively by ferc than by the maine board of environmental protection.
this very dialogue makes me able to ask a question that i think will reveal better to you what i need an answer to. reading this, and listening to the discussion, and your use of the word "atmospherics," suggests that the opinion below is pretty foggy. we have merck, the food and drug administration, the government, the entire biotechnology industry, the drug industry of the united states, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong in the way they stated the standard. and you, yourself, urge us to look beyond the way they stated it. so, what's the harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the unclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the standard, say, "that's the standard," and then send it back, and then you can make all your arguments there about how it applies.
you   you defend that position, that   that it doesn't violate the commerce clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?
what about the ruling that this would be governed by chinese law and that the chinese court is the best forum to consider that? that too has no lat   has no effect beyond the court in philadelphia?
yes, your honor.
well, the test has been formulated different ways  
what about, mr. zas, that the court thought it was home free on the speedy trial act? after all, it had gotten a waiver for all time. isn't that why the 165 days?
what was the something more and why wasn't that adequate?
mr. garre, could you crank up the thing? the sound isn't working, i don't think, mr. garre.
and no particular deference to the guidelines?
twenty competitors becomes a bit more difficult to get  
and exactly the same thing would be true if they had stated the triggering event clearly somewhere in   in the warrant. the   the argument here is that the triggering event was stated in the affidavit.
am i right that a tributary is not a defined term in the regulations? right?
well, to take the issue in its total context and refer to the instructions and the totality of what the jury is instructed, i would disagree that there is a presumption of death  
well, if it isn't a core matter. i think you lost on that in the district court.
no, i mean, it was  
that certainly is, and  
you're saying you can't bring an inter vivos trust   an inter vivos   interference with an inter vivos gift action in texas unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.
okay.
so for 72 hours, he could be held incommunicado without knowing why he was arrested.
you showed what happened in the past.
in the   have you ever heard of, or had, a client   or heard of a person from mexico who had been deported because he has been involved in drugs, and the government wants to bring him back because he may be a witness   maybe something develops, some other members of the gang are there, they'd like his information?
they have the same cards, we just have   they have the numbers, exactly.
  analysis.
may i ask how you would handle a case that is a successive petition, a late   a recently found claim, and the   filed beyond the statute of limitations but the state has three exceptions to the statute, but it does not require that the   the petitioner identify the exception in the petition? it just allows it for the judge to decide. would there be tolling during the period in which the judge decided whether or not the petition was timely in your view?
it would raise the   just do you think that that patent is valid? that's what i'm trying to ask you.
  ask this question? it's   official presuming   supposing we say it's not moot, and you prevail. could he be resentenced without being present in court?
i think it would not be in the case of state habeas, for this reason. the vast overwhelming number of cases that proceed into state habeas are on their way when they're final into federal habeas, and the state court was abandoning this argument for federal habeas. that is, it was removing any procedural impediment to a merits review.
a little while ago you were asked about the judge asking whether or not to ask the defendant if the advice was given him. and the suggestion was made there's no duty on the state judge to enforce a federal treaty, but if it's a matter of federal law, why wouldn't it be a duty to   on the judge to obey federal law if   if it is part of our federal requirement?
well  
yes, justice souter.
well, it just would seem to me that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may not be representing individuals who want to make the same claim, but there   there must be some lawyers who want to make these claims who don't have any clients, and the question is whether they have standing. and are they to be defeated standing because there are a lot of other lawyers who might also sue?
  felony, and  
  first of all, our principal submission is that congress's designation in schedule 1 is sufficient unto itself. but we also do include a further submission that, if the court didn't disagree with that, that congress's   congress, in schedule 1, has said that any mixture containing any amount of a listed hallucinogenic substance is barred. and there's no question that this substance contains that. but if the court was going to look beyond that to the facts of this case, there's also no question in this case that respondents' use of the substance produces the very effects that led congress to put the substance on schedule 1. so, to allow the   to allow the substance to be used would be in direct derogation of congress's judgment. the disagreement, such as there is, goes not to the   not to that question. and that's on page 214(a) of the joint appendix   or the petition appendix. the district court specifically found that those effects are produced. respondents' argument in the lower courts was essentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that those effects should be ignored. but we think that that's inconsistent with congress's judgment. so, my point is, if you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be for anything more than to   for the court to assure itself that the effects that caused congress to list the subject, in fact, occur, and  
there's no effort here on the part of the school to separate students on the basis of race. it's an assignment on the basis of race, correct?
the arizona state mine inspector. the  
right. i absolutely agree with you.
i think you can create objective criteria, just like this court has  
it has been our view under 390uu when section 390uu has been   has been raised.
yes. well, for attempts or complete   i mean, just say the standard of what presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if 1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes   whatever the category, did present such a risk, that would be sufficient under your view.
in effect, it would give you another chance in oregon.
step one, whatever the standard is, it has been met. step two, silence. we get to step three. what does the court consider at step three?
does it matter if the   if the ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury isn't discharged?
well, it's not really a box. i am satisfied, et cetera, the property so described is now concealed on the premises.
no, they're not.
yes, you would. i think   [laughter.]
but it's not rewriting. i mean   i mean, it's perhaps.
what if the state law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? would they be recoverable?
thank you, mr. kneedler. the case is submitted.
uh-huh.
absolutely.
the right direction would be   [laughter.]
that answer i couldn't answer, but i can tell you that typically in an education statute, funding is distributed on the basis of numbers of pupils. so if the statute says $3,000 per pupil shall go somewhere, the   the statute means you take that dollar amount and you  
but that is not the state's point, or   nor the united states government's point in this case.
well, i think what's really striking, justice breyer, is that there is no 17th century case law that reflects that. there's really a virtual, complete absence on the other side of this case of an affirmative argument supported by decided cases that says that evidence of that character was even known to the framers, let alone excluded. if you look closely at their constable cases, which is the closest cases that they   they submit, one of them is a report from the old bailey online source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in   in england, and one of them, the radbourne case, is right around the time of the framing, and there's a little line in the transcript where the constable says, well, i bent down and i asked the victim something and then the judge says, well, don't say that. there's no evidence that that was regarded as a   a legal ruling under confrontation principles. there's no evidence that the framers were aware of the radbourne old bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis in the treason statute, which was applicable there, which said that all evidence had to be given face to face. so that's their primary authority. their next authority  
well, maybe let me ask it directly. if they could so easily just say we incorporate the secretary's regulation in efig, why didn't they do it here?
thank you, counsel. general clement, you have four minutes remaining.
and the only case in which this court has actually applied a presumption of economic power is the loew's case, which was a copyright case. in fairness, however, loew's based the presumption that it recognized in the copyright context entirely on the reasoning of the patent misuse cases. so a   a holding that there is no presumption in the patent context would eviscerate the underlying rationale for loew's. indeed, as we explain in our brief, congress in our view has already done that because, again, loew's expressly states that the rationale for the presumption it adopts is that in the patent misuse cases, the court has   at that time, had rejected any attempt to extend the monopoly. but congress, in 1988 in the patent misuse reform act, overruled those cases and held that there cannot be patent misuse in the absence of an actual showing, based on all the circumstances, of market power. so the rationale and underpinnings of loew's have been entirely repudiated, which is one of the reasons why we think that this court ought to make it clear that there is no presumption of market power in a tying case where there  
would you tell us what   which one of these questions, in your view, we ought to address, first and foremost? if the answer to any of them is favorable to petitioner's position, i guess that's the end of the case.
we have some change of conditions, but the basic conditions remain, the trends has not been positive. for example, and i think that the petitioner picked  
i know for michigan. but i have to pay. but michigan is my   i can't ask the question until i get clear on this.
the oregon question, your honor, which i don't think the court is likely interested in  
if you're a new customer   and again, i want to reiterate that, how this applies to existing accounts is complicated  
in all of the prior federal circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. and what the court explained in gen-probe is that that is the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge validity, if it's still paying royalties.
typically the homeowner certainly should, but we all make mistakes and certainly there are lawyers  
because the client could raise it directly, represented by the attorney. and so the third prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in that case.
what i'm trying to think through is whether that issue is one that can be resolved on the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.
exactly. that   that's the only point i was trying to make on that score.
i think that would be equal access. i think you have to draw a practical line  
but would it be?
well, could you answer my question first? what kind of notice, if any, did mr. austin get?
i have no idea what that means. i mean, you   you go into this very elaborate system, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on the other. (laughter.)
but i   his answer would be, well, you only get to do that if you're under the federal arbitration act in the first place, and if you don't have a contract, then you're not under the federal arbitration act under state law.
  to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list under 703. so the d.c. circuit   and i think even the sg here, which seems like a variation of the d.c. circuit   much   the standards seem much   not as different as you might   as it seems to me you're saying. but   but they're   they're trying to be a little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific ellerth language because they recognize there are many possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the intent or   to stop them from complaining. that gives effect to the language differences.
do you concede there is monopoly power?
no, i'm not disagreeing with you.
and again   and i submit to you  
well, i   but the problem  
no, your honor.
they'd have to file a federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 31 days.
your honor, i submit that the sentiment is obvious to the jury.
well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though   even though you had more water the previous year.
and as to that aspect of it, the warrant is incorrect.
that   but that   but was  
i understand that   that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average.
  the second step  
the '580 patent is a program, as i understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be married to a computer in order to be patented.
well, on that point you disagree with the collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?
the state has the burden to show that he initiated.
no, but that   what they've been injured by   the presence of mail is the cause of the accident  
well, what does he   can you   can you describe it for us what   he gets 48 hours notice.
i think it's my understanding that if you sat on that fuel for the next year  
it's got the language of the sherman act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed markets. that's not in the sherman act, that's a description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.
  the tenth circuit rule.
no. under 924(c), you don't. but under the   under the   if you're bringing a federal prosecution under 924(c), the term "aggravated felony" has no role in that determination. it is a   it is a separate federal crime. we're talking about, here, the consequences of   the consequences of being an aggravated felon under 1101(a)(43) are, where does the definition of "aggravated felony" apply? it only applies under the ina if someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony. you're only   you're only subject to deportation for aggravated felony if you've been convicted, you're ineligible for cancellation or removal, you're subject to sentence enhancement. all those things follow on conviction. and we think it only makes sense to look to official the jurisdiction of conviction. that is  
i can't imagine that that wouldn't have been covered by the confrontation clause  
no, but if the law says, "you have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason   you have to reason your way towards the moral conclusion that he's deserving of death"   that's why i tried to take the law out of it. i don't want you to be a lawyer. i want you to be a juror. and i want you to give a moral reason  
yes, your honor.
so what about   what if the issue was mourning? the trial is being held and the families appear and they're all in black because they're still in mourning. does that violate this clearly established rule?
no, i understand  
that is correct.
well, that   that would be true if it said the state in which they are   in which they are respectively located, but it does say of the states.
sorry.
under turner, one of the considerations that can be taken into account are the budgetary limitations of state officials. does that apply under the ada, as well?
well, i   i mean, there's plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention. he has no intention of practicing this invention beyond the receipt of money. money damages are a completely adequate remedy under these particular circumstances, given   given especially the fact that if   if the infringement continues   and remember, this is not a situation where he proposes to continue to infringe. we propose to work around it, but if the infringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced damages and all of the deterrent power that that has, plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come back and say, well, no, now i've decided that injunctive relief is warranted under these circumstances.
this person goes  
  which is in the government's brief at 4a? it says, special trial judge's report. it is the only report to which the tax court rules refer.
  an answer that is  
with judge?
maybe the employer has the same interest in each. i  
if   if what you say is true, i don't know why it makes any difference that the defendant led the court into it. if you   if you believe that this is just a procedural nicety that was not complied with, why shouldn't you do the same thing when   when the court fails to make the finding but could have made the finding whether or not the defendant was the one that led him into it?
that's correct.
the numbers i have here, franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent. roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up from about 51 to 59. ballard jumped up from about 56 to 62. then garfield went down some, more mixed. but those were the worst ones; am i right on that?
it is possible. i'm back to justice alito's question. i mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us. so this doesn't have to be precedent for that. you're talking about this case. and there, i think the respondent   the petitioners here say that my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court is going to be able to start talking about whether this evidence is protected. what does that mean, protected? maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the sec hasn't thought about the particular conduct. we don't know what they're going to prove. i'm back to justice alito. how is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the court to enunciate?
and it's hard for me to  
it did not, your honor. it was a trial case.
how  
justice souter, this is to statute, and the word "corruptly" is not a word, that has been ever construed to require consciousness of illegality. that is a  
  all we're doing is looking at the statute.
scott has testified he  
because he was playing hooky because he chose not to be there, because he was not part of the class.
yes.
i don't believe there's another state that's done it exactly the same way. but i   but i would point out   and i think this is important, justice breyer   that   that at least according to the michigan supreme court in the bulger case, the majority of states don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based conviction. 21 of them rule it out entirely and expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals from plea-based convictions by   by allowing prosecutors to impose that   impose a waiver as a condition of entering into a plea. so   so the relevant universe for comparison is quite small here. it's really 12 states at most, and   and michigan sort of fits within the middle of those states in terms of the amount of resources that it provides and opportunities that it provides.
why not? because he's saying i am not asking for this to be one day further along. i'm just asking the state to give me a death that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.
as justice ginsburg pointed out, we believe that is this case. there is nothing between this case   different between this case  
can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?
no, i'm not saying only violent unlawful acts. but this is a case where if you look at it in the context of what was going on in the state at the time, where there was an active public debate on marijuana policy, on marijuana for medical use, marijuana for personal use, so it's  
how would you apply a holistic review to a kindergartner?
mr. frederick, are you going to get to the 1447(d) problem?
i disagree with your honor on   for two reasons. first, i think that, as several members have   certainly have said so far, that we should focus on whether there was a voluntary initiation. that has to be considered. secondly, i've heard mentioned several times that edwards only deals with badgering. i commit   commend this court to illinois   smith versus illinois   and minnick versus mississippi, where this court has said that edwards is not only about badgering, but the court said it's about overreaching by the police, whether it's explicit or subtle. so, it's not badgering, only. and when the petitioner says that edwards is only about badgering, this court has said that it's about more than badgering. it is whether there is overreaching by the police officers that is subtle, that is intentional, that is in deliberate   that is deliberate, any overreaching  
justice ginsburg, the petitioner in this case has agreed with us that this is the kind of discrete employment action that triggers the 180-day period. it is not like a sexual harassment claim.
no, your honor. what is a violation of 1951  
but you do agree that the conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the monopoly power  
a cure of  
what is established? that you've satisfied (e)(2)?
  the routine where you have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to shower when you're done, whether it's being   the meatpacking or the stuff at steiner   that's a pretty common occurrence.
and i just don't  
it does  
so going through the state system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel  
and all i'm saying is exactly whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the same thing.
it   it originated in a case where there could not possibly have been an intent   an intent to abuse because the   the transfer had occurred before there was any income tax.
or even nongermane political expenses.
general  
but if the payment of the premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the employees will get the benefits, why should you get priority?
i don't think the state  
if he's on parole, your honor, if he's   look, this applies to parolees in california who have been convicted of felonies, served time in prison, and have been  
i do not   strictly speaking, no, they were not entitled to notice because the   the intervention, it was secondary to the plaintiff's claim. that is, they did not intervene and assert the independent cause of action that the statute gave them. they intervened and claimed a lien upon the settlement's recovery. so since their lien, whatever amount that lien is, was derivative of the plaintiff's claim, i do not agree that they had to be notified of the   that the case had been settled and an order of dismissal was entered.
i'm not sure i understand.
piecemeal.
no, your honor. what the   what the counsel actually said was that the defendant's religious conversion did not provide an excuse for the crime itself. and, in fact, that argument was, itself, echoing the language of the factor (k) instruction, which of course  
and all that time, the statute has been tolled?
  then i think you are in the framework of heck against humphrey  
reasonably diligent efforts to ascertain a correct address after the return of the first certified mail and how far  
well, it is, justice ginsburg, if the   this is why the purpose of the statute is so important. if the purpose of the statute is to protect the integrity of the elections by ensuring that what organizations spend for political purposes represents the views of those who contributed the money, then it's very much to the point that there are other organizations. for example, the michigan chamber of commerce  
your honor, in black, the california supreme court repeatedly stated that the way the system works in california is that it is a mandatory system. so as an example, at 35 cal.4th 1254, the court stated, "the court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at least one aggravating factor." at 1260, the court said, "in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose the upper term." there are a number of statements throughout the black opinion that indicate the system has never changed from a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that reasonableness is not the issue. whether the system is mandatory or advisory  
there have been absolutely no such allegations made in this case. and i think a   i think that the san remo would have to concede that although there was a plethora of litigation in the state courts and in the lower federal courts about the zoning determinations and whether a conditional use permit was or wasn't required, the   the hotel conversion ordinance, the ordinance that requires the payment of this in lieu fee, applies across the board to all residential hotels based   wherever they're located in the city, whether they're in a historic district or not and whether they have to be rezoned or not. it was a simple, straightforward question about whether an ordinance that says if you run a residential hotel or you have residential rooms that you have certified as of the date the ordinance was enacted and you want to change them permanently to full-time tourist use, you have to bring an equivalent number of units on line or you have to pay an in lieu fee to the city's building fund. and they made a challenge, like many people have, that substantively that violates the federal and state takings clause. that is a taking of private property without just compensation. but it applies to all the residential hotels in the city wherever they're located, regardless of whether they need variances or   or anything like that. now, in this case they went first to the superior court in san francisco and they filed an administrative mandamus claim challenging the zoning determination that was made in their case because they're in a historic district. and at the same time, they went to the federal court and they raised all of their takings claims with respect to the ordinance and the zoning issues. they got a preliminary injunction in federal court which was then   but then lost a summary   they had summary judgment issued against them on all the substantive   all the claims in their case. when they came to the ninth circuit, they asked the ninth circuit to abstain under pullman because they had this municipal law question pending in the superior court. it had been pending for 5 years, and that might somehow obviate or change the constitutional question. and they then went to   they   the   the ninth circuit noted that it was rather unusual for the plaintiff to be invoking pullman abstention and certainly to be doing so for the first time on appeal after losing in the district court, but nonetheless, the ninth circuit said fine. and they then went to state court, and they pressed not only their pending municipal law question, but they also made their takings claims under penn central and under the substantially advance prong both as applied and both facial under the state constitution. and they received a full and fair hearing on those claims in the superior court, in the court of appeal where they won, and in the california supreme court where they ultimately lost 4 to 3. there   i don't believe there is any argument made or available in this case that there was a denial of a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues as to which preclusion is required.
can you articulate the rule that you want? be as precise as you can, if you would.
yeah.
i'm not sure i agree with a point that you make in your brief that civil actions simply are of no use. that might have been the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of these cases are successful below. what reason is there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate deterrent?
no they don't.
but that's a different test than the resemblance test that you're proposing.
mr. waxman, how do you   how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the communications act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? i mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. there's no 30-day limit there.
go on. i'll let  
that's what it said. it didn't say morse. it said diehr.
right. that   i understand that, justice stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search   that   that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the   that when   as soon as the search was   was ended, the   the warrant was executed.
  and, for jurisdictional purposes, there would be no case or controversy then?
  that in civil rule 15(a), the court has discretion and grants   needs to grant leave to amend after a responsive pleading has been filed. however, a petitioner gets to file a responsive pleading   excuse me, an amended petition, as a matter of right, before a responsive pleading is filed.
there have been   there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.
why is that a problem? suppose you have a school in which 60 percent of the students are either of asian ancestry or latino ancestry, and 40 percent are white as you classify people. and there are no african-american students at all. you would consider that to be a racially balanced school, would you not?
  a finding of fact by the trial court before us, and i don't   i still don't understand. from your point of view, why shouldn't we credit that?
  the court is excluding defense evidence based on a finding that a prosecution witness is credible.
oh, yes, and   and the remarkable thing is that every time it does that, it recites, we hereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge. now, in the old days, that was not a problem.
well, is   you   you have   justice kennedy alluded to one of your earlier arguments, and that is the   somehow the   the shackling affects the capacity to participate. i thought you meant by that if the   the hands are shackled, he can't write notes to counsel. do you mean something else?
and is new york just saying, "we're going to treat this thing as though it's totally unregulated, anyway"?
no, but isn't   isn't the significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of our continuation of the jury panel, going back to justice stevens' question? and what if the   what if the state had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped over, it could come right back to the same jury panel? would   would the   would the answer have to be different?
they had to move from here to somewhere else. that's  
fine. now, i'm now plated in michigan, and i make michigan my home state for this. and i go and i make   i say, michigan, i'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount i'm putting here for michigan, by the way, is zero. and you say pay me $100. no. i'm not going to do it. so i haven't paid them the $100. i haven't paid michigan everything, but i paid $2 for idaho. do i get the decal or don't i?
i'm not sure, mr. chief justice, that it follows that damage   that damages follow from that observation. and i think, with regard to the choices that are available to prisons, much has been made in this case about the affirmative obligations of the state to provide the minimum standards of health and safety for prisoners. and i'd point out that, in the court's decision in deshaney   specifically, footnote 7   the former chief justice wrote for the court that, in determining both the scope and how to satisfy those, there is an enormous amount of discretion imposed in the state. so, it's hard to say that that provision is allowing for   that minimal affirmative burden that's on the state is in any way congruent with the broad affirmative remedies that are at stake in this case. now, if i could just go through, very quickly, the various constitutional rights that are being addressed here by the   that are being claimed here by the petitioner, you can see, in each case, why it's not a proportional and congruent remedy to use title ii of the ada to enforce them. first of all, with regard to the equal protection clause, it's almost obvious, from the findings of congress, that they meant to impose a higher degree of scrutiny. by citing the words of carolene products, as well as matthews against lucas, that's   have justified heightened scrutiny to apply to the disabled, this is almost proof positive that title ii   and the ada, in general   is changing the level of constitutional law. it's not enforcing; it's changing the law.
but he does have to stand up when the judge comes in  
state agencies don't generally do that because there's a specific statutory prohibition on that. and justice scalia, this goes to your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 u.s.c. 484(a) and 481. it's true that those provisions say by their terms that visitorial authority resides exclusively with the comptroller of the currency with respect to national banks, and there's another provision that deals with affiliates. and so that's the point with visitorial authority. but visitorial authority by its very nature is asserted in service of and enforcement of some underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement that operating subsidiaries register with the state. and so there's a question of conflict preemption that applies both to the national bank and the operating subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive registration requirement could be applied to the national bank or could be applied to the operating subsidiary.
and i suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in state court or federal court. correct?
yes. yes. i mean, a serious effort to go back and say, "look, harmless error throughout." i mean, i'm pushing the same thing i said before.
had a rule 59 motion been made, would it preserve a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument in connection with the motion for new trial?
thank you, mr. west. general mckenna, you have 7 minutes remaining.
well, but as i indicated, every victim of a fourth amendment rights, even those who are guilty, even those who are convicted   that's the herring case. herring exactly shows  
no. i   i grant you that. but to say that the only test is relevance seems to be too strong.
did you come here  
yes, your honor. and it's   it's connected to the statutory language. aedpa says we'll toll for properly filed applications. that   aedpa is keyed to how much process the state post-conviction courts will give you. in a   in a state where they say anyone who comes after a year, we won't give you any review and you're just out of court, aedpa says when   that's not   we're not going to consider that properly filed. we won't toll, but  
but that's the case  
your honor, i would respectfully dispute that, in that our reading of the opinion, as well as the government's brief in that case, seemed to propose no unusual rule of exhaustion. it appeared that the rule of exhaustion that was being discussed was an ordinary rule of exhaustion. so, i don't believe that there was anything unusual about the exhaustion concept that was at issue in that case. finally, i would submit that congress's purposes in enacting  
but with  
do you really expect to get five votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 years?
the circumstances included the fact that he sat on this thing for 3 years. he could have brought it 3 years earlier, couldn't he?
we're not looking for that. we're looking for the opposite. as i read this, the banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your laws. they've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally mandated powers. okay? so they're just saying, we only get the ones that are in conflict. now, they then have a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they don't. so my question to you is, give me a list here of which ones they think conflict that you think don't.
well, if the croupier is participating in the navigation of the vessel, we don't care anymore.
well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this   the denial of that instruction here.
i understand that, but that's   we have to get into that is my point. we can't just say since providing them with   with phony id's is unlawful, it can't be the business of the corporation.
i think i wrote that opinion. (laughter.)
i was going to say, perhaps there were no specific holdings, because it would have been regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the rule in the first place. nobody had dreamed up this scheme earlier.
because i read the district court opinion. i think he said   the judge said that both parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in either way, no disputed issues relative to whether to grant relief. and i   it's on page 24a of the cert petition. and i understand you to be saying that leaving everything alone, affirming would allow the case to go forward with your adversaries seeking damages on an active-inducement theory. am i correct?
well, or   or   but   but what congress   if i may go back to the parole statute, before 1231(a)(6) was enacted, the only statute that governed the detention and the release of aliens arriving at our shores, what used to be called excludable aliens, was the parole statute. that provision   until the aliens before this court were ordered  
that's very powerfully hard to prove, isn't it?
your honor, i think   i mean, i agree with you that he did make additional findings. but  
and that's fine, and they have an express provision in 48   484(a) that says they're, they're exempt from regulation. the question is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies is immune from the regulation that those other companies  
but the burden on  
well, again, justice breyer, it's a question of allocating scarce legal resources. if you   and this case is a perfect example of that. this case is not   does not involve an appeal as of right. it involves a discretionary appeal, and   and that's the vast bulk of   of appeals that are addressed by the   by the michigan court of appeals. so if you impose here on the state of michigan an obligation to provide counsel in all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the people of michigan to reallocate their legal resources away from other cases or you're requiring the legislature to increase taxes to pay for that   to pay for that  
for pro se petitions who have been assigned counsel, your honor?
one  
well, recall at   at this point the sequence is critical. by this time, defense counsel in his voir dire questioning had already let the cat out of the bag. either you do or will know that he's restrained. but by  
and what if it's a bench trial?
  if your standard is, the only cases that go into court under the first amendment are cases where the employer says, "i had no basis for doing anything to him whatsoever," then i think there will be few such cases, though you might convince me that that standard  
yes, your honor. and where you have  
the   the   what   what we've detailed here in our complaint is an extreme and tortuous method of   of death. at this point  
before you were asked a brief question.
could they even impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric power license saying, "you must comply with state water quality standards"?
"i'm lucky not to be in jail."
i think that is a good characterization, your honor.
then i don't think we should talk about it.
do you  
to what   what other area would this apply? if the county has sovereign immunity, how about the county school board?
what they said was until more is understood about causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to regulate these emissions.
and the strongest case for you on that is?
no, we agree with respondents on the meaning of adverse action.
yes, but what has to be clear under teague is not just the rule, but the rule's application in circumstances like this. there are a lot of rules that are clear, but if teague means anything at all it has to mean that you should have known that, in this case, the rule would produce this result. so it's not enough to say that there was a rule. there are a lot of rules out there, but the question is whether the outcome should have been clear at the time. isn't that what teague means?
justice scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. and you should take great comfort from the fact, the court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title vi  
  decision, where, as i read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors listed in the statute?
  but let me just interrupt on your   your best case suggestion. i don't think the test is when has the word any been used in different ways, but has the word any court ever been used by congress to include foreign courts.
  clear that, a, we haven't, but b, in any event, the due process theory sounds the same in both. and so if there's not a due process problem, with respect to these arguably inconsistent theories, then there's not a due process problem with respect to his sentence either. he hasn't brought any other set of facts  
well, if   if, in fact, it is the case that mohawk is   is providing the social security cards, isn't it directing the means by which the third   the third entity is, in effect, illegally   or supplying illegal workers in   in this   this joint enterprise?
it does say "in any way."
didn't it come from the west   did it come from the west coast originally?
well, it would mean you don't get into court at all then. right?
we believe it would be a closer question, but the fact that he was not there in school today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in a public place in a public event who was not acting as a student.
correct. and in those cases where all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the   the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act, it's our position that that's where venue would lie. as a practical matter, if there is   if   if this court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it would be highly unlikely that there would not be some overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the offense.
no, justice o'connor, the death penalty situation, lethal injection, is different, for a number of reasons. of course, the d.a. has long taken a position of non-enforcement in that context, which would be protected by this court's decision in heckler against cheney.
  the child testified to what she heard, and i thought she heard a car and someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with that someone.
the only issue before us, as i remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run.
they may be wrong, too. they may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as the officers who conducted it. and there are indeed those in the west who think that the blm does, does act quite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld by, by the, the administrative courts. now, if that's a problem, what's the solution to that problem?
here's what impacts the expectations. what impacts the expectations is the following. i'll give you an example that appears from the joint appendix on the court of appeals from pages 1263 to 1277. in the year 2000, the city of oneida cited two oneida indian nation businesses, a convenience store and a gas station, for 16 fire code violations. the tribe citing this court's decision in brendale said, we're not governed by the local fire code. we're governed by tribal jurisdiction. it's more than just the interference, the issue of taxation, the issue of sovereignty is whether a gas station is going to blow up or burn down  
justice ginsburg, you're exactly correct. you don't have to reach the issue about how expansive 704 is here. you can affirm the sixth circuit's decision based upon the material adverse employment action standard that they articulated, that was litigated below, that the defendant did not object to, and which we won on.
yes. i believe so. if i understood you correctly   the question correctly, yes.
but you're just giving them an additional ground for termination.
after several years  
but the arizona court, the court of appeals, writes that it turns on the finding of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal offense. it is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive that the act was wrong. now, those words, written by the arizona court, suggested to me that, in the case of the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a martian, they would say he does not know right from wrong, here, now, in this case. that, it seemed to me, is what the court of appeals wrote.
then  
well, functionally it is the equivalent of codifying the complete preemption doctrine, which is how slusa actually works. and in the complete preemption cases, beneficial bank is what spells out this  
but this is a   this is a place   a case in which the warrant was for drugs. is that not so?
i know. i know that's what they said.
  whether to speak.
well, it did involve, at least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment invalidating the inter vivos trust. was that necessary to the decision? or am i   correct me if i'm  
it is conceivable, but i would suggest the more reasonable inference is they followed their long line of precedents that said we're not going to interpose, as the chief justice suggests, a total bar to raising these claims. so for procedural default and for successive writs, we're not going to penalize petitioners for failing to make objections. just because the state court decides to be more lenient than the federal courts in that respect does not mean that they also need to apply the lesser standard of  
well, clearly ake vs. oklahoma holds that if the state invocation of the procedural rule is dependent on a judgment about federal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is not an independent basis for decision under the independent adequacy grounds.
yes. it would still be an equitable claim because the question still is are you enforcing the terms of the plan, and   and the equitable lien cases make quite clear that that court in equity will enforce that so long as a particular   so long as a particular fund, even if it has not yet come into existence, is what's been specified. in fact, the cases that are cited by petitioners' counsel to the contrary, starting with the trist case, was a case that was specifically disapproved in barnes against alexander as resting on other grounds. that was a case where the   there was a contingent fee for lobbying congress and there was a statute that forbade it. there were two other grounds that the court decided the case, and then justice holmes in the barnes case went on to say   well, insofar as the question is open, he gave the answer, which is the question as to whether there's an equitable lien is determined by what the contract says. as far as the make-whole doctrine, another point about the make-whole doctrine that's worth keeping in mind is that insofar as some states have applied it, as a matter of their insurance law and have said, well, an insurance company is not allowed under our state's law to contract out of the make-whole doctrine which we   under our state's law is the default rule. insofar as a state has said that, that would apply equally to erisa plans under the insurance savings clause and there wouldn't be any question i think that it would. but  
well, this is the anomaly. you're asking us to buy an interpretation. an enterprise is u.s.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to customers, passengers, and employment.
but all of this is really getting pretty far from what i think is really the key question in the case. matlock is decided. and matlock said   it referred to the risk that a joint occupant undertakes, the risk of inability to control access during one's absence. so, the scene in matlock is: one occupant is there, the other is absent; and the one who was absent assumes the risk that the one who was there will exercise control. matlock doesn't speak to the two people who are in disagreement situation.
yes.
no. he operates with total candor. he's saying exactly what he feels like saying.
is that effective? does the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?
and   and with respect, i think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this court has   has used in spending clause cases between retaliation in the context of an ocr investigation and retaliation generally, but   i'm sorry.
not   not  
first of all, your honor, i apologize for not being clear enough. when i say it is not we, but the congress, that has closed the doors of the federal court, i mean on the substantive question of whether the case was removable. we are dealing here, only by definition, with the cases that were incorrectly removed. so, the real question, i think, when we get down to the policies, is, there is some concern that defendants, under the rule i propose, would have an incentive to remove somewhat fewer cases. they would reserve the questionable removals only for the cases in which they could convince themselves and their clients that the argument was good enough, and the stakes high enough, to justify the cost. now, i submit to you, that's exactly the same sort of situation we have now. it is merely that, now, when making that cost-benefit analysis, the defendant is thinking only of its own fees that it will incur. but, still, that is a cost. and the congress, notably, has not seen fit to alleviate that cost at all. so, some questionable removals are already deterred by expense under the rule i propose; some, more would be. on the same   by the same token, the rule i propose would give good incentives to the plaintiffs' lawyers to be aware of the jurisdictional issues, to mitigate them, and mitigate them well. now, why do i suggest to you that  
i don't think that the court, if the court comes to a conclusion on its own that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it would have been in their interest to do this in the absence of conspiracy, is wrong, then the court is not following conventional pleading standards.
it had the   it had the power to determine whether slusa applied.
business processes?
yes. as i understand it, justice souter, and i think the stipulations make this clear, there's a reference in the stipulations to encoded transmissions but there's a   but the parties also agree that's the same process as the golden disk. the golden disk is sent abroad. that is read by a machine and then the machine understands   it's almost as if you were to read physically any other type of document, read it to a machine. the machine understands what is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a disk or on a hard drive. many copies are made in that fashion. they are installed in computers made abroad, sold to foreign purchasers.
well, it's market participation if all they're doing is public collection and bringing it  
  the focus may have changed, but, i mean, he hadn't dropped the   he hadn't dropped the claim that that was one of the causes  
all right.
that was true of  
it's not harmless. you're saying it's a procedural error.
yes.
i don't see how, because  
may i begin, your honor  
yeah   that   right. but i unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so i thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.
and i would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the voting rights act of 1965. so everybody now has access to congress. the whole spectrum of american society is in congress. so if congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the united states. so, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in sullivan, would make sense. but i submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. over there in congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. retaliation is not there. if i may, though, justice breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration  
it's  
oh, in those cases, correct. in cases where there is violence, there will be recovery. in a case such as the instant one, where there is no nakedness, there is no violence, they simply opened an unlocked door, i would say, yes, there would be no recovery, in that circumstance; there would be no damages. there may be cases   and this is why not   i'm not arguing there was no knock-and-announce violation, in that the police shouldn't knock and announce, because, in different cases, the consequences may be dramatic, they may be severe, and damages may be severely assessed.
yes. i believe congress would have intended it to be more  
i disagree. i disagree with you, justice breyer. i   i think that even for a pro se petitioner, i do not think it is more difficult for him to find the door of the state courthouse than it is to find the door of the federal courthouse. and the key, i think, to your argument is that claims are unexhausted by definition if there's an available state court remedy. therefore, by definition, they ought to be going to the state courthouse rather than the federal courthouse.
your honor, i think you do and i think that boykin addresses that there has to be a colloquy with a plea of guilty, and that the   the defendant can't tacitly consent to a plea of guilty. but our position is that this is not a plea of guilty. this is not a complete surrender. this is a tactical retreat made for reasons of trying to contest the one issue in this case that could be contested, and that was trying to save this defendant's life. this lawyer took 52 depositions. he hired medical professionals. he investigated mr. nixon's background, going back to the age of 10. he did everything  
  just   just as the contract isn't before us.
suppose, this might help, suppose the physician testifies that i wanted to do a non-intact, an in utero d&e, that that's, that was my intent, that's what i wanted to do, that's what i always want to do. in this case i had an intact delivery and had no other choice. are you saying that we could interpret the statute to say that that is not the prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from prosecution in that case?
they could. suppose they could. right. could they fine him   how much money did you lose here?
well, i think that the reason why not is that if the fraud is affecting the plaintiff's decision to purchase, then that falls within slusa, and that is preempted, although it allow   you are allowed to have a federal remedy under that standard. you're rechanneled to federal court. but if you buy   to use your hypothetical, you buy in january, but the fraudulent misrepresentations are not made until may or june, you're precluded from bringing a federal-law claim.
okay. he didn't receive the   the death penalty. what would his argument be with respect to guilt or innocence? it seems to me that the issue only goes to penalty.
  your case, the   the judge is   is  
i am not sure. under the  
the answer is no.
fine. and now all they want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.
that's right.
our  
the  
well, i think she's also admitting that youth wasn't a reason because she's saying there are other young people on the jury, and the significant question here  
yes. the objection in this case came   you know, in the  
well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?
i think the nippert case was from the 1940's i believe. in any event, as we've been discussing  
this is not a   a pullman abstention case here.
well  
miss gartner, with regard to your argument that the statute here did not track what you have described as the characteristics, the hallmarks, i think the answer from the other side is that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a clear line between a legitimate abortion and infanticide. and if that is the theory, then whether it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is irrelevant. what would your answer be to that?
you mean everybody in the entire united states gets the same piece of paper.
it's not a matter of law.
one that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised by the state, correct?
no, your honor.
he's   he's been convicted. we know he's dangerous.
the only thing specifically included in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities. and once you assume that "principal activity or activities" includes everything that's integral and essential to principal activities, (a)(1) doesn't cover it.
no, they're   it hasn't really been mentioned until the   i mean, hardly mentioned at all, until the government decided to   the united states government decided to discuss that point.
so you think it is not violated, not that it doesn't apply for some reason? there is no doubt this is spending clause legislation, right?
it had not stopped. no, it had not, your honor.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i'm not sure it's a tweak at all. it   it just depends on   on what you consider to be working conditions. and in   in many contexts, we've given the broadest possible interpretation to working conditions.
well  
the union may say, okay, we're going to take this one up.
well, but there are two different without delay points: one, when you tell the   the defendant; and secondly, whether or not he wants the consulate notified, and there's the second delay.
and that's   it   it seems to me that's a   that's much more rigorous than the standard that you've proposed in   in your brief, and that   and that other courts use in the batson case. the batson inquiry, as   as i understand it, is   is simply that, an inquiry. there's a basis to ask the prosecutor the reason. that's all.
that's an   that's an evolution over time. it's  
  both know  
i don't think we have to revisit richards. i   i think what   what i'm   what i'm concerned is that you don't make an argument based on the evidence in this case that you had probable cause to believe that there were going to be guns facing you when   when you went in the door and therefore the knock was not required.
so what you're arguing here  
no, i just want to know what  
yes, mr. chief justice.
so it may have been for just one day of the trial?
the freedom of information act, your honor, which was passed in 1974, which, interestingly, i think, undermines the petitioner's argument that, in using the word "may," congress somehow incorporated the "newman" standard. [laughter.]
perhaps i misunderstood. if   i thought the box was the mail, itself, that you're throwing  
in   i don't follow that, because i thought the theory of the cases were that you can waive something by conduct. and so, when you ask a court for relief against a party, then it's reasonable to say, "if you're coming in and asking the court to give you something, then it's only fair that your adversary should be able to"  
what would you do with banners? would it make sense to say all banners are banned from the courtroom? i thought you would think that would make a lot of sense.
don't you do that on   on dry land in some states?
thank you, counsel. mr. radmore, you have 7 minutes remaining.
  placement? do we have the same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter what?
it is often true that sometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when you push the logic of extremes. there is no doubt about that.
mr. chief justice  
yes.
i don't think that's correct, with respect. in barnes against alexander and in the whole line of cases that we cite, the court has made quite clear that parties can commit contractually that a particular fund that will come into existence in the future should be used for a certain purpose, and that will be equitably enforced.
well  
well, the proper procedure under rule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in that way; it's  
what is the standard? i ask that because i'm not certain from what i heard previously   i think the state was saying that the only issue that was raised before the state proceeding, collateral, the state collateral post-sentencing proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something like that. when i've looked at this, it's on page 88, the motion filed says we have two claims. one claim is the claim that was just mentioned, it says that   about it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and alcohol.
the court, having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, still no eighth amendment violation because the petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.
may i ask this question, mr. cole? i am troubled also, as you point out, about the least restrictive language in the statute. but as i try and apply it to this particular case, weren't most of the allegations that the petitioners made is that they were treated differently from other mainstream religions and that the accommodation would have been, well, treat them the same, which would have been the least restrictive alternative? it wouldn't have created all the problems you describe. and they say they don't   can't have group meetings. they   if they were treated exactly the same, would that   that would satisfy the least restrictive alternative part of the statute, wouldn't it? and why would that be such a burden?
some states   counsel, some states have homestead exemptions to property taxes for people when they're buying homes in the state. that   those would be invalid under your theory?
  if he  
  me until halfway through the trial that it was robbery i was being accused of because they left robbery out of the indictment.
do we usually   do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements of the party? in other words, if the reason the contract is void or voidable has to do with broad state public policy, do we   what   what's this   the best you case you have for the notion that arbitrators enforce those types of constraints as opposed to figuring out what the parties agreed to?
your honor, on the basis of the entirety of the record, which is what this court instructed the district court to examine when it conducts a schlup inquiry.
well, i take   you   you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. it's not just attorney's fees. it's damages.
i understand that.
thank you. mr. gits.
explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.
but if i   i say my explanation for why i pay the newer people more is really i like to have that atmosphere. you make less money in my business, but it's more democratic and people are happier even though no one will invest in my company. (laughter.)
i mean, i see 1170(b). and i understand your argument, but when i read the california supreme court opinion in black, it says, well, this is what it means. it doesn't seem to be what it means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?
well, but if they had been on  
because i would, i would disagree with the notion that further proceedings could be had on that application. the basis for this court's certiorari of jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further review or correction in any state.
  correct?
well, what do you make of  
(inaudible)
they're making this argument, and i think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose. i think this is what's behind, and you tell me if i'm wrong. one purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumer's credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage.
no, it doesn't, mr. chief justice, because the   the   in   in the street and abood decisions, the court has   has said that there is   all   has talked in terms of expenditures that are not germane to collective bargaining.
and there   there was a link between hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between hurtz and the victim?
since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the goldberg-schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place. in other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people. now, suppose you start with that. you're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking. what's your test? of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?
it's   it's the same with diversity jurisdiction. you can make the same argument. there's nothing distinctive here. this statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in federal court. fine. but the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court. and i don't know why this is any more demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction, where congress has said you're entitled to trial in federal court.
any claim, your honor, that's brought in in a third party practice, any claim that's brought in an additional party claim is part of the same civil action. there's only one form of action. all the claims are in that one form of action. the importance of this, incidentally, is that their entire argument depends on interpretation of the two words, civil action. does the district court have original jurisdiction over a civil action if the civil action includes claims over which there's clearly original jurisdiction and claims where there is not? now, historically   incidentally, exxon has to basically make new law, and they do it by saying that zahn stands for the proposition that there's no jurisdiction over a class action which includes smaller claimants. i   i dare you to read zahn and find those words. they don't exist. all zahn says, all snyder said, which preceded it, is that every class member's claim must be viewed individually. now, that's a very interesting conclusion. in other words, it doesn't say there's no jurisdiction over the class action. it simply says the claims of the absent class members who don't meet the jurisdictional amount should be dismissed. now, interesting, look at the language in 1332. it says the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000. well, when we read that statute and we apply zahn and snyder, we say civil action doesn't mean the aggregate of all claims. there we say what it means is we must evaluate each individual claim to determine if each individual claim within the civil action meets the jurisdictional minimum of the diversity statute.
but this is not a generic burglary. therefore, we have to assume that the attempt in this case could have been nothing more than stepping across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over to take the apple. and therefore, don't we have to go to court records? in other words, don't we have to take advantage of the qualification in shepard and taylor before this case can finally be decided?
yes, it has. thank you, mr. elwood. mr. reichel, we'll hear from you.
what   what page is that?
but nobody has explicitly done that yet. is that correct?
along with all of the other provisions in 1101(a)(43), you look to state law, in the case of a state offense   the state of conviction, the jurisdiction  
  hasn't been proven, either. but  
can i say what it is?
the court went on to say, however, that if the civil damage action would not necessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could proceed even though there had not been a favorable termination, reversal, or expungement  
of course, the reason that the federal circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on graham is that they say obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight. in hindsight everybody says, i could have thought of that; and that you need   if you don't have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.
but that doesn't  
well, but perhaps only for   for the operation of, you know, what the various steps are. you have to go step one first, step two next, and so forth.
it has been destroyed, but massachusetts state law requires that there be a factual basis before the court can accept a guilty plea. and i think we can   under the presumption of regularity that attaches to guilty pleas, you can presume that occurred.
in some states, a prescription would violate state law; and in other cases, in other states, that same prescription would not.
right.
mr. phillips, how many states have these fair franchising laws? are there any states that don't?
certainly not.
i think we would take the position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional power. i don't think, though   he has not acted in this case on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws of war. he's acted inconsistent with 150 years of tradition.
you're saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here. i thought that's what you were saying.
i believe that the petitioner would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at the state court level and if they were somehow denied relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing that would preclude the federal court from granting them relief thereafter.
holistic for me. what   what does it   what does it modify? i mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?
it protects it, but in a much  
  not the  
do you think that finding is correct?
what did they say?
it may have been the state auditor, but it also the  
the chapter 13 trustee  
yeah, we're not asking for the police department to drop everything. we're just asking that they  
which is a very different issue. in other words, it's not waived and over with at that point, but it says nothing whatsoever, in express terms, about pending motions.
maybe. it's not   it's not maybe  
thank you, counsel. ms. williams, you have 2 minutes remaining.
if he was charged that way, they probably could, yes. there could be a two-count indictment or there could be alternatives. but that wasn't this case.
thank you, counsel. general lockyer, you have 4 minutes remaining.
right. okay.
  may i ask you about the position this court took in glucksberg? that is, everyone on the court in that case seemed to assume that physician-assisted suicide was a matter for the state, and the government, at that time, said, "state legislatures undoubtedly have the authority to create the kind of exception to assisted suicide fashioned by the court of appeals. there is every reason to believe that state legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in this case in a fair and impartial way." and then the government added that, "there is no indication that the political processes are malfunctioning in this area." that was a position presented to this court in the glucksberg case by the government. now, you are rejecting that position.
you will see the instruction for mercy again.
which would have been the date on which it was newly recognized.
would your   would your rule  
no, no, because it's where you walk in the door. and you started out by saying this case, i think as you must, was a proper federal case. it was properly filed in   and it was properly filed in delaware. so you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door. if that kind of case, you go in that door. you have a case here that could go in either door, the federal, the state. the usual rule is, is it not, that if federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events. for example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's state and the only basis for federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?
well, that is perhaps why the agency tries this   to do the informal process. but, in fact, it does not have legal operative effect. there   you could completely ignore that initial demand letter, and say, "sorry, agency, i'm not responding." the agency then files its order. and that's the first time you must register your defenses, upon failure or forfeiture  
the factual claims that we're making in federal court are the same factual claims that we made in the state court  
i think there are several provisions, your honor. first of all, in the recitals, it states that the purpose of the treaty is to carry out the government's policy in removing the indians from the east to the west of the mississippi. article 2 also notes that the kansas lands will be a permanent home for all indians now residing in the state of new york as well as elsewhere, and article 4 states that there will be an exercise of sovereignty. it says specifically that will they will be able to establish their own form of government, appoint their officers and administer their laws in the kansas land specifically. so i think those are the strongest provisions. i would also like to touch for a moment if i can on a question that several members of the court have raised which is what is the impact of this decision here. from the perspective of the state of new york and the localities, it's very serious because it does concern whether or not the tribe can unilaterally regain sovereignty over a very large tract of land in central new york. this is an area that has been  
your honor, i don't believe that this is an inoperative part of the statute. i believe that   that   this direction to gao makes no sense if all congress sought to authorize was attorneys' fees and the costs that are historically available under section 1920 and section 1821. this provision makes no sense.
yes, that is true.
well, our point is that it is a matter for the court's discretion. and there may well be circumstances where it would be an abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness objection. for example, if the case had gone on for years, and a trial had been held, as your honor suggested in the question earlier, that might well be an abuse of discretion, but it would not   for example, take the case where the district court had dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals said, "you know, that merits issue is a very difficult one. and, in fact, we think we might have to remand for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. but, you know, this case was untimely filed. we can dispose of it on that basis. and we can save all of those judicial and party resources by addressing that issue now." we think that would be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion. here, as your honor noted earlier, this was the first thing that happened in the district court after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the reply. there was no waste of judicial resources by the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in the first thing that the court did after that briefing. there was no prejudice to the petitioner, because it was omitted from the state's responsive pleading. there is   as the court said in granberry, the failure to plead it perhaps waives the district   the state's opportunity to insist on the defense. the state, because it said, in its answer here, erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity to stand on, and insist on, that defense. but it is not an absolute forfeiture. it does not bar the party from suggesting at a later time, "we would like to amend," or, in this case, the court to note it sua sponte. the court did, here, of course, give the petitioner every opportunity  
who made that, who made that determination, including the selective citations?
absolutely right. of course, that's right. but we can't be sure what they would have done, and because we can't be sure what they would have done, i guess it might well have made a difference that the state told that panel we think stumpf pulled the trigger.
i don't think so. i tried to figure that out. i think  
so, i want the textual answer.
certainly justice souter, but then the question is, for those fee payers, and certainly there are going to be some out of three or four thousand that do not give affirmative authorization, then what do you do with their funds? and the, the  
no, but i'm suggesting he could sell the product with the same label if he just changed the product to correct the misstatement.
that's correct, your honor. very few cases would   would have a retroactivity decision within a year of initial recognition.
my complaint is  
that's correct. we withdrew the request for a brooke group instruction. but to finish my point about the fact that this  
and that  
right.
with respect, we would disagree. there's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer would think that just because an ad says it's funded by the nation's beef producers, every single one of the 850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees with every single statement  
i'm just wondering what  
let's say it's the same person who made the decision. you know, five years ago he said i'm giving a 6 percent raise to men, i'm giving a 3 percent raise to women, and then he decides that's illegal, and so from now on everybody is going to get a 4 percent raise every year if you meet certain standards. is that ongoing discrimination or is that a neutral thing, that he doesn't have to take into account the past discrimination?
counsel, even in   in those benighted days, i don't think   i don't think we ever would use the conference report when the statute was not ambiguous. i thought it was always a rule that   that  
thank you, mr. hungar. mr. frederick.
all the water is waters of the united states, navigable waters, but the water is being discharged from the facility into the navigable waters. you   your honor has mentioned a storage dam. a storage dam creates an impoundment. in fact, one of these dams has a 50-foot-high wall that holds the water back, almost 200 acres of water. at times, there is water that goes over the top of the dam. that is, indeed, a discharge. it is caused by the activity. it results from the activity. it's not the free-flowing water. and i want to make that clear. i think, justice scalia, your question was   that's not a discharge. that's a natural flow of water. what's happening here is, the flow is being altered. because of the impoundment, because of the diversion, the flow is being altered. and in the case at hand here, you're actually taking a turbine, the water drops down into the turbine, turns the turbine blades or fans, it absorbs the water of its power, and then the water is released, discharged, into the tailrace channel, into the natural river.
  we don't use the   i mean, you could use the due process clause for everything, for double jeopardy, for all of the other protections in the constitution. i think our cases say if   if there's a problem that has been created by ignoring the double jeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by   by the deus ex machina of the due process clause.
well, you had three forensic 23 experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think 24 the papers were relevant either.
but you said  
that was the  
  and assured yourself on that?
what do you do with their   their hypothetical in both your friend's brief and the government's brief about ford motor company, not in terms of 1332 but common parlance? if you ask somebody where ford motor is located, they're likely to respond by saying, well, what do you mean? do you mean their headquarters? do you mean the   the plant down the street? do you mean the dealership? it does suggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning that you rely on.
your honor, with due respect that was the legal conclusion of the washington supreme court. it was not a construction of the statute. it was a legal conclusion based on their reading or divining of voter intend. but this court is not bound by such an assessment.
yes, the treaty of buffalo creek. it makes clear both the language of the treaty itself as well as its historical context that it was intended to terminate oneida sovereignty in new york state.
and the   and the   i don't see how that is at all inconsistent with what i'm suggesting here. i really don't.
  to the police officer, that no longer could come in.
well, because they voted either way of voting   or for voting in the libertarians and   and not voting, they have changed and possibly have changed, especially when they went to the  
we dispute that for the following reason, your honor, that   that the   the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land. title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose. but i think their sky-is-falling argument really falls apart here. all that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. there is absolutely no contention here that alaska would   would prevent scientists who want to study this   these lands from doing that. we let scientists onto all of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it. we hope to work cooperatively with the federal government on this. the   the idea that alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here i think demeans our federal structure. we have a federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the states because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there. we are not planning on   on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there. by the way, they did not at the time of the monument, your honor, do scuba diving because there   there really wasn't any scuba diving going on. but to   to move on   i see my time is up.
well, why isn't it the sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and the distributor?
  this a harder or easier case than wickard when we know that, in wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?
i think that's an allegation by counsel that that may be the case.
leaving   is there anything you can say before i give up on this? and maybe the answer is no. is there anything you can say that would relieve my concern, which is completely practical at the moment, that if i decide in your favor, there suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal cases where defendants will say the reason i was prosecuted was because of something i said? i was advocating motorcycles. i was advocating beating people up. i was advocating a congressional change of something. many, many such cases. they'll all get at least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become open to the world. now, that's what's concerning. can you say anything to relieve that concern?
no, the   there's a separate entity, called kim's auto. that  
thank you, mr. madden. mr. korrell, you have four minutes remaining.
that would be another one, too.
thank you.
well, justice scalia, the fundamental teachings on the fourteenth amendment of this court demonstrate that race is different, that the government use of race is presumed to be unlawful  
that's a curiosity. it is.
and   and  
why isn't that up to the option of the petitioner? he can take his chances or he can wait.
they both present very little potential risk. they don't even really   under a serious potential risk, they don't present that. a conspiracy shouldn't either. a conspiracy and attempt are not different things because a conspiracy doesn't official qualify  
i mean, not even   it is not only the warrant, but the affidavit itself doesn't say we merely request permission to search after the   after the event. it's a general request for authority to search.
i  
the   in that case, the patent holder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit, laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be easily resolved, on that ground. but, in terms of the question before the court today, that wouldn't be an article iii matter. i think, as a policy matter   so, moving off the question before the court right now   as a policy matter, the   it's not clear from this court's cases exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable. i think there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging from pope   the type of promise that was extracted in pope, which this court held was unenforceable  
do  
that's correct, your honor. that is correct. however, the treaty wanted to be   the treaty writers were very careful to not impinge on traditional religious use. and rfra   and there's one more thing that i've been trying to say, and that is that rfra requires not just a compelling interest, but a compelling interest to the person, and it requires least-restrictive means.
that there's   and incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are general objectives of sentencing.
but i think  
well, he received a   a final disposition on the non-technical procedural basis which was the applicable law at the time. he received that adjudication and  
if you have to pay it before the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the business, you would have no way of measuring the number of miles you're going to travel during the   the ensuing year.
and so  
it is not.
yes.
exactly.
i mean, i take you'll win on any  
you don't think mr.   you don't think judge bryson forgot about the four-factor test, do you?
in all due respect, justice scalia, they did not join the gasoline. the gasoline was separate and apart. they   that was very important. they maintained them separate and apart. they competed separately for at least 8 months.
i think that would have been completely within the trial court's discretion.
and   and, justice souter, i understand that point. however, i   i tend to believe that this is, after all, an aberration case. petitioner has suggested and the solicitor general has suggested that businesses may tend to sandbag this issue. i simply do not believe that that is a realistic danger at all. in this case, quite frankly, the matter was overlooked, and that's how we ended up here. but in most cases, these small businesses are not going to be looking to spend a lot of money and go through a whole trial and then say, oh, well, i had my shot at it. let me see. if   if it doesn't work out now, i'll get out as a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. most cases, small businesses are going to say, make this case go away from me as fast as you can. and so i don't think that that's really much of a danger to suggest that this is a pattern that's going to be repeated, especially after a decision from this court. if this court, as we believe that it should, comes down and holds that this is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, i think parties will raise the matter and get it disposed of.
that's right.
  engage in speech that you don't agree with. now you're saying that the more  
well, that's different than it is in the federal courts. you have to   can't wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.
i   i acknowledged that in   in my question. i recognize it is the leadership in many of these countries that objects to it. but let us   let us assume that it's an accepted practice in most countries of the world not to execute a juvenile for moral reasons. that has no bearing on whether or not what we're doing is unusual?
that   that   i know that were   that was the facts, your honor, in the   in the banks case, that there was a check made out to both. in fact   in fact, there was  
well, it wouldn't, because then the question is what do you do after you've segregated them. if the statute  
thank you, mr. lang. general long, we'll hear from you, please.
  by me. no, please.
if i understand the question that you asked, your honor, if the title came from the state of new york, for example, in the  
would you elaborate for this reason? because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document. you use the word report.
what  
well, since the government is now taking the position that another duke could do just what was done here and there's an enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though it's those against the current government policy?
no. the waiver argument is not properly before you. it was not passed upon by the court of appeals below. moreover, it was, for the most part, not preserved in the court of appeals below. while they did argue that virginia military institute waived sovereign immunity for all claims involving virginia military institute in the sixth circuit, they made no such argument that filing proof of claim constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity for the transactions involving the other institutions.
they both have 1981 claims, but the damages are different in the case of the individual than in the case of the corporation.
well, we can't act on it unless, unless it's final. we, we need final action by the state court, don't we?
so, the sec  
i do not believe it is. i think   i think strong inference   if we're doing the numbers game   may actually be 40 percent. if a district judge is looking, again, i say at the entirety of discounts  
no, your honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. there are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.
  accidents.
where did the   where did the trial court say that in the findings of fact?
yes, but the expressive objective is, the law schools are taking a position on first-amendment grounds. that position is interfering with military recruitment. no question about it. i don't know how much, but i will assume that there is no question about it. the solomon amendment is addressed solely, as i understand it, at the expressive activities which have, as you say, this interference. its sole objective is expressive.
i thought it was the position of the federal circuit that deepsouth has to be brought into an electronic era, and so the   the federal circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that notion should apply to an electronic world.
  you've still answered my question. i mean, you're   you have said, "assuming that the individual is executing the statute, there is no deficiency in the performance of executing the statute. there is still this function." and i think i understand your answer. but, i mean, i think justice scalia's point is correct, it may apply in cases in which you are purporting to act under the statute, but you omit actions that you should take. in other words, your performance is deficient. and there, the answer is easier, because it says as long as you're exercising due care, no liability.
oh, so  
okay.
your honor, we respectfully disagree. we don't believe that there was any suspension of the time for filing once the ninth circuit was divested of jurisdiction. this court as long ago as the eisenberg case has recognized that the time for filing certiorari is suspended so long as a lower court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the case. the court reinforced that more recently  
well, in this case we have provided, as the second circuit  
i would respectfully submit that given the nature of the opening and closing, the words that were used, in   in that kind of a extreme situation, that is a decision that the client should make. this is not a decision that is a normal strategy decision that a lawyer would normally make, such as which witnesses to   to call, aside from the defendant himself, the order of the witnesses, and   and types of cross examination. this is a very  
why? why? you see, i can think of a million things. i can't think literally of a million, but it does seem  
adequate indicia of reliability.
was there any opposition? was there any   is there any history of anyone in this senate or the house either before or after suggesting that they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert fees?
laddering, tying, and excessive compensation. and it's had a number of enforcement actions. its regulation m is focused exactly on those practices. it's issued very detailed guidance in a document that we attach to our petition appendix on what constitutes  
do you think the statute, putting aside the medical emergency issue under our precedence, is the parental notification aspect of the statute constitutional?
i'm not talking about burden-of-proof failure.
i don't think erroneous. it was allegedly maliciously motivated.
in this case, the district court was presented with maps that would be more fair on   on pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what the district court concluded is it didn't have the ability   that making that judgment was a political judgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it. and so it drew in the districts it was required to draw because texas had two new districts. it drew in what it believed the voting rights act required, and beyond that, it made as few changes as possible. and so the district court recognized that the consequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever partisan bias was there before is reflected in its own map that just neutrally carries over the preexisting bias. and that's why the district court found it was perpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to do so, but because it was consciously restraining itself from doing anything to alter the partisan composition other than to carry over what was already there.
any crime that carries more than a year basically. it's pretty  
but scott   yes, your honor, i think that is part of the analysis.
i can't imagine   i can't imagine, mr. waxman, that congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying.
well, why, when you  
no. i'm just asking the really formal question. was the word employer used to refer to your client at any point in the pleadings?
suppose shall does mean shall. fine. but you might have a statute that says the fire department shall respond to fires, the police department shall respond to crimes, the army shall respond to attacks. even the word shall doesn't necessarily mean that this is the kind of interest that, like property, the duke of rutland relied upon blackacre, that welfare recipients rely upon continuing to receive money. what is it about this that makes it like property, even if shall does mean shall?
no, i   i think that you have   to show contribution, you should have   you have to be making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're doing so. and so  
no. dr. gross' report says he 15 might have a violent reaction to alcohol. and he 16 testified that was   i was throwing that out as a theory. 17 i have no idea. i had ruled out alcoholism. i had ruled 18 out blackouts. and so the question to me was maybe 19 there's something out there about violent chemical 20 reactions to alcohol. counsel testified that the   that 21 they followed up on that by hiring experts who they 22 thought could examine that issue, and they both concluded 23 that there was nothing there. this is not an instance where you have, you 25 know, open inquiries that counsel didn't follow up on. 1 every court in this case has recognized  
pardon me?
if you're   if you're right, i take it, we would not have jurisdiction to review a federal ground that was raised by a state court, even though it had not been raised by the parties. if they get   you know, they get the opinion from the court and there's a big surprise   the   the state court decided to go off on   on a federal ground, which had not been pressed   i take it on your view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.
there would have   if the remedy was not available, because the prisoner  
that's right.
if there were a way to do that, i   i would agree with that.
  so i think we're asking  
thank you, mr. moran. the case is submitted.
thank you, mr. kneedler. ms. robin-vergeer.
  that's a   that's a difficult argument for us  
i know, but i'm asking you why that   why that should be. if   if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, i   i think they would say that going to jail is worse.
it depends on the purpose for which you are acting whether it's government speech. in rust v. sullivan, even though i think you're certainly right, justice scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called government speech, in order to rationalize it, in rosenberger and velazquez, it was so described. but the question there wasn't, "can people be made to support it?" the question, rather, was, "can the government insist on staying within the terms of its grants and saying you can't talk about abortion?" when the question is, "can the government force you to support it," the "it," if it's government speech, doesn't help. the first amendment makes it a harder case for them, not easier.
i mean, i would perhaps have come to a different conclusion than california supreme court on that question, but we can overturn them only if they're objectively unreasonable. and that's   that's the hard thing because   for me.
but   but here, that's not this case because he said, and when i complained, they did it again.
thank you, ms. rivkind. ms. kirkland, you have two and a half minutes left.
one thing i did want to point out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour   and of course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour  
so a substantial component of reasonableness under strickland is whether or not you follow the client's instructions?
  also susceptible to abuse.
mr. chief justice, if i can take you to the big book that i asked you to  
well, but there are two questions in the cert petition and it's the second one that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one is whether there's a cause of action.
no, i'm not there. i lent him the car. (laughter.)
no, i don't either.
no. no. that was a statute that was adopted specifically for child witnesses.
  within 5 years  
again   i asked this before, and i think you were cut off before you had a chance. incidental with respect to what? all of the money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast, a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is it incidental to however many times the president has breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?
if we want to place an ad in october, the solution is to place an ad november through september, and then we're okay. and the only reason we're going to do it november through september is so we can do it in october?
why does 7461 require its   its disclosure? because it does say that the   it's only the decision of the tax court.
justice o'connor, i would be much more offended by having to put it in my license plate. but if i were raising cattle, and i were told, as they were told in this case, "cattle equals beef; that's all it's worth, and that's why we won't let you, in these ads   we won't let the ads, that you have to pay for, increase the demands for cattle; only beef"  
your honor, thank you.
  even when a u.s.  
well, that's possible, but you have a case here where the wife says, "come in," and the husband is right there and says, "no, you can't."
  to obey an order  
but a double jeopardy claim is   is a claim in which there is an   a   an immunity textually conferred by the   the constitution, or at least, we   we have thought it   the guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical sense, unless you read it that way. you don't have that   that situation here.
general  
so that if we rule in your favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in california will be that judges can now depart without making a particular finding, they can increase the sentence even though they do not find an aggravator within the limits of the california system.
but they were  
like justice stevens, i think that's a yes or no. (laughter.)
all right, that's all i wanted to know.
that's exactly what i   i tried to read some treatises on this, and the more i read, the more confused i got. i started out thinking, well, it's sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on october 14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by force or threat of force, take property belonging to someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be sufficient. and that you don't have to say, and in addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist. can you give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's relevant here?
i think that's true, your honor. but what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden in order to establish standing under this case, is that regulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in this case will make a difference to them.
which is not   did not seem to me to be alleging a violation of the fourth amendment.
i'm not certain, your honor. they referred to the  
they said it already.
in south carolina. it's not   it's not as though you're being sent to some other place. the only question is whether they would have access to the federal court. but as far as personal jurisdiction is concerned, you have it in south carolina.
well, i disagree, your honor. and what i would point you to is   is that the long   every time this court has spoken with regard to the clear statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships, it has referred to the internal order doctrine. and that is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go back for centuries. the   the treaty that was at issue in the wildenhus's case expressly said that if the   if the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise affected the interests of the port state, that the port state law would apply. and that is the general rule. the international regime that governs this area by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it available to port states and to flag states to add additional requirements. that would mean  
i want to focus you on the question. i think what you're doing, which is a reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to the english definition of search. i say forget that. let's look to the fourth amendment because there are a whole range of searches that don't even fall within the fourth amendment in the sense that we don't need a justification. and i take place as saying that dog sniffs is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word english search. so i want to know why it is that this dog search is one of the ones that's a fourth amendment search, i.e., one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of what the fourth amendment is about, privacy.
but, of course, they would have been aware of those that are also less american in their patronage and so forth.
oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the court to say.
that was the first holding. the second holding was that the plaintiff had sufficiently claimed a cause of action on the seizure. and then it went back to the lower court to be considered under the garner analysis. and what i liked about your decision   excuse me, mr. chief justice.
well, as this court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. i mean, excuse me. a guilty plea provides very substantial benefits. and so the effect of the michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.
you're saying there is a duty not to use deadly force.
mr. marcus.
well  
okay. i would think that even if it were apparent on the face of the petition, that the   rule 4 has two parts. in the first part of it, the nonadversary screening function, only applies when the petitioner is plainly not entitled to relief. and i think the better view of that   of that clause is   - although there are some arguments in our brief that don't take this view   i   after having given it thought, i think the better view of that clause is that it does not apply to an affirmative defense that's subject to waiver or tolling, that you can't say, based on an affirmative defense that's subject to waiver or tolling, that someone is plainly not entitled to relief. you could say, for example  
oh. all right.
why do you assume that it   - that it is the reasonable expectation of two people who have   who are living together in   on   in common premises, that, where one of them wants somebody to come in, and the other one does not want somebody to come in, the person may come in? i would think that the normal assumption is just the opposite, that, where one wants somebody excluded, that person will be excluded.
why can't   why can't we let the market take care of the problem?
what about   you were talking about public speaking. there was, as i remember, a talk that was given to the mexican-american bar association, and that was not something that his employer required him to do, but he  
but i would have thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm of the state doctrine, that the   the nature of the activity is one of the key questions we look at.
yes.
yes.
precisely? so then the  
well   two points. first, davis versus passman was decided in a day in which this court was much more likely to infer new causes of action from the constitution or from statutes. the court in its recent cases, most recently malesko, has said that it's sworn off that habit, and it's refused to recognize any new bivens action in 25 years since those cases were decided. secondly, the respondent here has ample remedies and avenues that he could seek. if he believes that there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek damages under the federal tort claims act.
and is yours that every single objection that might be made in this entire trial record, every one, is a separate transaction or occurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?
the court, in atkinson trading and in montana versus united states, before that, had said that the tribe may be able to regulate conduct on non-indian lands to the extent that the conduct involves voluntary transactions with the tribe or its members or to the extent that the regulation is necessary in order to protect the tribe's sovereign over the land that it possesses is  
of a violation.
windows wasn't around when this statute was passed.
but it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case   your claim had been lodged in the right court.
if you  
if  
why do i feel wind whipping past my ears as i go through a trap door? (laughter.)
well, he says, well, this is content discrimination. is that  
  the case?
one   one short question. is the draft of the injunction that you want in the record?
and that depends on the nature of the evidence, i take it? i mean, if the evidence we were talking about was biological predisposition to violence, that's only going to point in one direction, right? i mean, if the evidence is isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well, that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.
what   so what   what about the talent scout who tells the celebrity that he'll take 10 percent of the celebrity's movie proceeds or the management search person that's going to take a   a third of the executive's pay for the first 6 months? where   are all   all these cases ones in which there   there's no income to the   to the principal, we'll call them?
the case is submitted.
so look at the trouble we get into when we take your interpretation. suppose we take the government's interpretation and think only of first habeas. leave second habeas out of it for a moment. but if it were only first habeas and those were all the habeases in the world, wouldn't theirs be better? every prisoner would know that when you get the right, you file. okay, no problem. and you're going to win if, and only if, you get a court to say it was retroactive. so that's fine. we all know. all the prisoners know we've got to file within a year. it would cause no problem if there were only first habeases.
how was   how was that? i thought you'd go on to say how that   how was it? i   i read that dr. blake said this. he said, look, i   there   there are tiny little specks of blood on the jeans and we test them. they were tested. and they show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree x, and that's true of the test tube blood as well. both deteriorated to degree x. but if you take fresh blood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration. so conclusion: the blood on the jeans came from the test tube. now, you say that was discredited, but i didn't read anywhere anything that discredited it. what was the discrediting of that?
  understand how you can separate the past from the present in that fashion. one, i suppose, could say, "well, i'm going to make inducing remarks monday through thursday, and i'm going to stop, thursday night." the sales of the product on friday are still going to be sales which are the result of the inducing remarks monday through wednesday. and you're asking, in effect   you're asking us   to ignore monday through thursday.
and so, why should the remedy for the violation be to exclude those items? the privacy that's protected isn't the cocaine, the weapons, the other items that were discovered.
yes, but it's absolutely clear, i thought, that the fda, at the end of the day in some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not only safety, but how effective it is. and sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, i understood at least, that could affect the decisions. so, i would think that you would want to encourage the exemption to cover those matters.
well, my second-best analog, i guess, would be a workers' comp carrier, an insurer, or  
okay, but isn't that a  
but we  
right. and   and i would suggest that at equity, whether we look at it historically or even in a modern sense, a subrogation-based claim or an equitable claim would require mamsi demonstrating that some of the settlement it received constituted a payment for medical expenses. and that  
no, but if there were the problems that you hypothesize here, congress could have dealt with them by enacting something that dealt with the proliferation of branch banks rather than interpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's  
  with this statute. and is it true that for most of that period that's been the rule, where most of litigation has taken place  
no. well, because what they have   you have to go back to the original list. the list starts off with individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, and other legal entities, unions, which is in addition to that because it's not a legal entity, or at least there was case law at the time  
  you're asking us to interpret the same words, "principal activity or activities," differently in sub (2) that was at issue in steiner, and in sub (1), and then the clause that follows both of those. the same phrase is used. so if "principal activity" includes donning or doffing, under sub (2), why wouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following clauses?
that's correct, mr. chief justice. the oregon supreme court's conclusion is very broad, that any alibi evidence comes in, and, as the dissent notes, that it also would not be limited simply to alibi evidence, but any evidence that is inconsistent with the guilt verdict in this case that would form a basis for arguing that doubt about the defendant's guilt should be a factor that the jury considers in responding to the mitigation question that  
but you could if the person making the decision was aware of the discriminatory policy.
i   i would say no.
why don't you   why don't you try to draw that line? why don't you say that just as the applicability or not may depend upon whether you're dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're dealing with an american who happens to be injured on board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least in some of its applications requires structural changes or not? that would enable you to say the ada doesn't apply, but would not compel you to say that title ii doesn't apply.
but would have a 1983 case if he were disciplined or disadvantaged in the workplace because of the talk that he gave to the mexican-american bar association in which he criticized da office policies?
  the person  
  if the tribe is collecting   it's assuming that   if the tribe is collecting its tax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or greater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a taxing authority being interfered with?
was it raised? was that objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the briefs and  
  being paid if they win. in this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because they're not representing a client. all they get is a declaration.
the answer to your question is that black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory nature of california's determinate sentencing law, and it has always operated in a mandatory way.
well, i mean, that's what we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some ambiguity in it. there being ambiguity, why should we find a line that doesn't make any sense?
but   but is   why   why don't you simply say, look   have a very simple line. if they can arrest, they can sniff. if they can't arrest, they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to drugs or whatever.
i guess my   so that leads me to this question, because   i mean, i, my understanding is it's not a generic burglary. therefore, even on your reading of the statute, an attempted burglary in florida doesn't necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in under the residuary clause, of course. and because there is a possibility that the only burglary charged was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to   don't we have to send the thing back to find out either from court records whether something more than a mere penetration of curtilage was involved here? and if so, whether   whether that penetration carried with it the potential for harm?
i suppose employee associations, workman compensation schemes and congress have all relied on it.
do you think they have the affirmative obligation to ask him if he is a foreign national?
you're not certain about the hypothetical but you're certain about the statute, aren't you?
well, your honor, i think this is an attempt by the respondent to rewrite the question presented. neither  
what   what happens if he doesn't come up with an answer in   in this case? what  
well, the constitution still applies to it, and they are inherently anticipatory.
i'm sorry, your honor. i missed the first  
it is in part one of timing, but it's not one of timing alone. that is, our position is if mr. whitman had been successful in prevailing upon the union to take the case to arbitration and then to the flra, the position we've taken in the brief is that judicial review, if the flra had rendered an unfavorable decision, would most appropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals pursuant to the csra. but our position is if the union is unwilling to take the grievance to the point where the ruling can be reviewed under the provisions of the csra itself, that the apa remains available as a fallback. but the   the fact that it's one of timing doesn't make it an insignificant difference. that is  
nothing was being rationed.
let's assume, let's assume that one of the recipients of comp payments had come forward and said: i object to the plan, i have a claim for comp payments and i object to the plan because it doesn't provide for them. and the   the court said, you're, you're right. the plan is going to include provision for comp payments and it had been so amended, and it was then   the plan was then amended. would you, under those circumstances, have had any   would travelers, under those circumstances, have had any reason to assert a claim?
it's a federal question about what the nature of the claim is, and if the state's misunderstanding of the federal claim was what was intertwined with its conclusion that it was an inadequate objection, that is a misunderstanding of federal law. we also believe that the procedural, that the application  
well  
doesn't that seem strange to you?
but i   i wouldn't put a lot of money on it. (laughter.)
burden of persuasion on the element of inducement is on the defendant. the defendant has to prove more likely than not that the government induced this crime in the sense that it took actions that are likely to override what a innocent person would have done. at that point, the burden shifts to the government to show that this particular defendant was predisposed. now, that's consistent with background common law principles under which, once it's shown that one party has been engaging in wrongful conduct, i.e., inducement, then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to show that its conduct did not have its likely effect in that case. and that's why the government then has to come back and show that with respect to this particular individual, that particular individual was predisposed, even though we took wrongful actions that would have induced an innocent person to do this.
i still   i'm not trying to be thick.
what if   what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child. not only doesn't that help you, it seems to me it hurts you. it acknowledges that there are rights accorded to parents.
  the court of appeals did  
well, are there any circumstances in which the court can   and let's again, as justice souter said, say that it put it on the record what it was going to do, that we hereby, after the supreme court has ruled in the case, will withhold   order that the mandate shall be withheld for a period of 30 days because there is a   a new case coming out on a different issue that may affect our   our holdings?
in the case of cable modem service, your honor, it's a number of things. it's the ability to, for example, retrieve information from a server that somebody has on the web  
it is in the record which we have?
well, i'll do primary jurisdiction last, your honor. my view is that to bring in the other case is, in effect, to exculpate antitrust violations. on this narrow case that we've alleged, under connelly versus gibson there is no other case. anybody who's charged with murder or any serious conduct could say: well, you can't really apply that because this is the other case.
no. these aren't sniffs for   for explosives. these are sniffs for drugs and   and these   these are not buses that are coming in from france. they're coming in from one american city to another. and   and there's no more need in   in that case than there was in this case. it was just a good   a good place to find criminals who were carrying unlawful drugs.
the   the court has kind of three groups of cases with regard to the number of states. on one extreme, are enmund and coker where you have three and eight states. on the other extreme, are penry and stanford where you have 24 and 34 states. and then there's this middle group, which isn't just atkins and this case. it's also tison, which is also almost exactly the same number. the court in atkins had to find a way of distinguishing tison, to the extent the court relied on that   that counting process, and the   the court concluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with regard to the mentally retarded. we don't have that kind of trend here. in  
well, there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency.
yes, but just as a practical matter, tell us what you're arguing about. what does alaska think it can do if it prevails in the glacier monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical matter?
in real world terms, what's involved here? what are examples of some of the things that michigan does or some other state does that impair or impede the operations to the  
well, one of the reasons that one can't go in this direction here, brooke group was a pricing only case. as the briefs make clear and the decision made clear, if that had been a standard monopolization case it would have been out the door on summary judgment because the defendant was a 12 percent player. they had no prospect of, of attempted or monopolization, a viable monopolization claim. here we have a situation where weyerhaeuser's pricing conduct, deliberately and artificially pushing the market up through a variety of mechanisms, was also interconnected and linked to complementary other conduct that we think set the table for the effectiveness of their strategy in elevating the log market that our client was participating in. bear in mind that, that at ja 901 we have a weyerhaeuser document showing that very significant foreclosure from their exclusive contracts in the, in oregon for example, this is a document that shows that 62 percent of the market was covered through either exclusive purchase arrangements between weyerhaeuser and large landowners, or non-efficiency-based trades were the, were linked to the exchange of the alder sawlogs from that landowner. only 33 percent according to ja 901 show, in oregon, was projected to be open market bidding. weyerhaeuser acquired, when it was then at a 65 percent market share, acquired the dominant seller, a built-in monopsony in british columbia and it's five, 15 to 20-year exclusive forest licenses. that kind of foreclosure, linked with the anticompetitive behavior they engaged in that was a variety of bidding practices, some of it was overbuying, some of it was manipulating bidding back and forth, and then putting the last bid in terms of that cost on the other side. i think it's important, i'd like to shift to the instruction again, and make the point that weyerhaeuser never gave either the plaintiff in this case or the district judge the opportunity to consider a different instruction than was given here. and the fact that's demonstratively shown if one looks at page 43 of their opening brief in the ninth circuit, in the ninth circuit they only took the position in the bulk of their brief that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of brooke group. as to the ground or the contention  
or not punish for other  
uh-huh.
could the arbitrator decide that i'm   i'm going to apply the new statute rather than the old one?
i'm sorry, your honor.
because the federal question involved the preemption issue as to whether the state statute had been preempted by the anti-lien statute.
mr. chief justice, i think you got to the heart of the matter when you said that if it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on. the flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so good, the prosecutor would have every incentive at least not to put them on the stand. why would somebody put on a stand   put somebody on a stand that doesn't seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment when they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape recorder already?
i thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children.
and you're saying that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a conviction for a particular serious crime that's going to go unpunished otherwise?
does that   did that requirement apply after the ninth circuit decision? is there a requirement that the   the lawyer be investigated for possible discipline?
yes, your honor.
well, but i want to know what your position is. traffic offenders?
mr. blair.
justice ginsburg, i offer this one observation. under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. so in the sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. and   but i would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. under title ix, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to ocr and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. and we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. in a private lawsuit filed by mr. jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. if he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. in other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.
your honor, the finding of the district court, which we're relying on here, was that it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship rather than on the basis of race. now, they started out by trying to engineer the defeat in the   in the legislative process, engineer the defeat of the six democratic congressmen who had managed to be elected in republican-leaning districts because they were moderate to conservative and they were, as the district court put it, able to appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for them in 2002. by the end of the legislative process, they went further and decided to take the risk of eliminating one of only four districts in the state in which african americans had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of the hispanic opportunity districts in south texas. now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that with another hispanic opportunity district, but that was the one that we've called the land bridge district, district 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban concentrations of latinos in austin and in mcallen down on the mexican border.
but then, your honor, you run up against your decision in tyler v. cain, and that was the circumstance of the litigant in tyler v. cain. no   this court had not previously determined that the right at issue in tyler v. cain was retroactively applicable, and under the second or successive statute that   in the way the court read this, the court said that this court could not determine the retroactivity of, i believe it was, cage v. louisiana in that very case because it was contrary to the language in the statute.
i   i don't   i don't think so, justice scalia. i think it was certainly open to them and the   the ninth circuit, in its first opinion, made clear that it was open to them, when they went   when they did their williamson county ripening, to also litigate the federal constitutional question. and in that instance, if they lost in the california courts, of course, they could have petitioned. they couldn't   if they lost on the state constitution, the court would have had to reach the federal constitutional question as well. but i think, justice scalia, more to your point about what actually happened here, i think that a very good argument   i   i don't think that there's really much doubt that if they had petitioned for certiorari from the california supreme court decision, you could easily have granted review under zacchini and michigan v. long and ruiz because the california supreme court said, to be sure we are deciding only the state constitutional question. we are not ruling on the fifth amendment. but they made very clear that, whatever congruent means   they made very clear that they looked to this court's statements and expositions about the meaning of the fifth amendment to construe the claims the same. and as this court said in ohio v. reiner, i think 2 years ago, when a state court's interpretation of state law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of federal law, we may review. and in fact, if you think about it, think of almost every takings case that you've decided since williamson county. with the exception of the tahoe compact cases, they are all from state court decisions. lucas, palazzolo, first english, nolan and dollan, yee, pennell, mcdonald, san diego, they are all  
it's the application that is not subject to review. we review the state court judgment, not the state application, correct?
  hope not.
the   the question was whether the truck drivers counted as employees because if they did, they'd have enough?
  i think  
well, it may be that the in whole part of this may have been slightly misleading, although i think you can make an argument that you can end up with in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter. but that's not the   that wasn't the complaint at trial. it wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't the basis for the court of appeals decision. if the court wants to send it back and say, is there another objection to this instruction, that's fine. but it seems to me, this court ought to address this issue in the way it has been presented. official
and that position is incorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal matter. as a factual matter, lincoln is a completely proper party. its name is on the lease. it was the employer of mr. roche, who was one of the plaintiffs in the suit. it issued the mold policies that are at issue in the case. all of its advertising is alleged to have been fraudulent in the original complaint. and it was the director and manager of the agents whose acts were alleged to have been negligent here. there's  
that   that was a decision by the chief. so   (laughter.)
i think that it could still be a substantial federal question because it could implicate a substantial federal interest.
how long has this statute been on the books, this wire fraud statute? pretty old statute.
thank you.
  offering to the public communications service.
it's not preventing the lethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be performed prior to any part of the delivery, because there is no doubt there will be a lethal act. the only issue is when it may be performed.
why do you think it's totally inapplicable?
but couldn't congress forbid that under   by reason of its control of the navigable waters  
it would appear to   no. it would appear not to be, because  
it's recognized  
well, we think that that is   12 i'll   i'll say that there's no   we don't believe that 13 there is a requirement in the federal statute, in 14 agreement with   with your statement, to exercise 15 diligence and seeking the vacatur. but we believe that 16 that is a necessary consequence of the administrative 17 decision that this court made in custis and daniels to 18 send these back to the state court. it   it could have been the case that these 20 were all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, i think 21 that was the prevailing practice before custis, that they 22 were challenged at sentencing. but custis and then 23 followed on by daniels made a different decision, and i 24 think a good one. it made the decision to wrap these 25 challenges back to the state and that inevitably will 1 result in delays as it works it way through the state. the rationale for the court's decision makes 3 perfect sense when you apply it to this context. one of 4 the key concerns, it seems to me, that the court had was 5 that if you allow these federal challenges that are 6 outside the state statute of limitations, then it's very 7 possible the state is not going to have the records 8 necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected 9 to keep records outside of their statute of limitations. and that's simply not the case here because 11 these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be 12 within the state statutes of limitations, and as this 13 court recognized in daniels, the states have a powerful 14 interest in defending their convictions and that powerful 15 interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the 16 records necessary to maintain their convictions.
  thing here  
the jury instruction said less than what you have suggested, justice breyer, no question about it, but what they did require was that there be an intent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation. i think  
correct.
it doesn't have to be spelled out in the warrant itself.
well, that's why they had an en banc determination, because the judges were in disarray over that question. but at the time of this trial of the en banc decision in the ninth circuit, gracidas-ulibarry, had established concretely that the intent of the legislature was to incorporate the common law meaning of the word "attempt."
that's right. and how would he know except from published report that these blocks were failing?
  under these court's   under this court's decisions. but at common law, the prosecutor did have the protection of malicious prosecution, and as justice scalia observed in his concurring opinion in the kalina decision, the elements of the tort of prosecution essentially had a built-in qualified immunity, and the probable cause requirement was essentially that. it afforded protection for the prosecutor. the   the private citizen who   who   the complaining witness   he could not be the subject of a suit for damages if   if the charges were dismissed, not simply upon a showing   it required more than simply a showing of malice. it required a showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons that are essentially identical to the qualified immunity and absolute immunity   the   the reasons for qualified and absolute immunity.
and   and the difference   the difference is this is a content-based inquiry.
i don't   i don't understand that statement. you say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year. do you really mean it would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply be there to be used?
that's correct, your honor. she has   she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. she's a law-abiding citizen. this goes back to the issue of what the   incentives there are that are created by this. this is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.
counsel, i   i think he was given the death sentence. is that right?
i would certainly think, your honor, that a wise school board would use other methods to achieve that result. yes.
well, that would be my argument, your honor, that he was premature.
  if it meant a labor union there  
and the doctrine extended immunity to them on that basis, not   not as sovereigns.
  the   the argument you're making is really one of invited error, and i'm not sure it even applies on these facts. i mean, the   the defense lawyer didn't, as you hypothesized in one of your answers, say something to the effect of don't worry, you don't need to make any findings of the ends of justice or anything like that. he just said i'm waiving my speedy trial rights, and that may mean he's not gong to argue, you know, that the ends of justice don't justify it or whatever. he's just saying i don't have any objection. maybe he assumed that the judge would go on and say, okay, i'm making the findings required by subsection 8(a).
the reading in bishop against wood was really counterintuitive also, as the dissenters pointed out, as you would agree, i think.
it  
they are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for. that would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?
but you're   you're not asserting that the apa governs this.
or whether there are alternative theories of liability available under arizona state law.
it   it should get the job done.
i think the ruling from this court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense against likelihood of confusion.
i think congress enacted the statute in 1995 against the backdrop of   of settled law that federal programs are typically litigated in federal court. what happened, though, was that the states started   started enacting provisions in the area and congress went to work in 1978 and enacted a preemption provision to reemphasize what i   what it believed in the first instance. then in 1998, after courts continued even to interpret the preemption provision narrowly, they went back to the   they went back to the   to the statute and they strengthened it even further to make it absolutely clear. so i think what we have is a  
the tie would go to the prisoner, yes. were it in equipoise, because the state would have the burden the state would lose. i don't think that's what happened in this case. i think what justice breyer, what this court said o'neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in o'neal, is, do i think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict? and that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said "the court doesn't find that there's an insufficient showing"   that's the same way of saying i haven't been persuaded   that the error contributed to the verdict. so i don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court. this court was not persuaded and that is all that matters. when the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses. the second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of brecht, and we do. we've laid it out in our brief. we think that in no sense does this record support the notion, support the argument, that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded, talking about third party culpability. and that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, what evidence was in there about mr. hurtz. there was i think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved. but it requires looking at the whole record. and there were   the defense here was not a hurtz versus fry. this was a case where the defense did an excellent job. it was a well defended case, and threw up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it bought on. in the third trial you had what you didn't had in the prior trials. you had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime. you have his own admission, his own testimony, that he left the house that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out in the truck that was seen at   a truck of the same type, that was seen at the crime scene.
i'm sorry, your honor?
it seems to be. in fact, there was an indication in the brief that the government had taken the position that if the government came out front and said, "hey, we're urging you to eat more meat," that, in fact, it would be very unsuccessful in doing it. it seems to want to hide the ball here.
no, but you're saying   you're saying he could have been charged with second-degree murder  
well, there would, no doubt, be other restrictions. justice kennedy mentioned ethical rules. under the federal whistle-blower statute  
there is no harm in proceeding under 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing with a simple refund action. you're not dealing with trying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy. you're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.
absolutely.
the   i mean, the   the trial court did correct it. it may not be the sufficient correction in this court's eye, but the court did give an admonition that relegated the prosecutor's statements to that of the advocate and not to the instructions of the court.
nobody will even know what that means, but it has the   [laughter.]
that claim would  
well, again, your honor, the rule says  
when he turned into the   when he turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving through a parking lot. he was going through a private access road in a shopping mall which was closed at 11 o'clock at night. and the collision, the impact occurred when officer scott, who was going too fast to make the turn into the shopping center, went up to the next intersection, came around the other way to head my client off at the pass. and then what happened was that mr. harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when mr. harris   excuse me when officer scott   put himself right in mr. harris' way.
in other words, you take all the   there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number. so we write each one on a card. is that what we're, is that our distribution? we have like, let's say we have a, a thousand cards. is that what it is?
that's correct, your honor. and if the court would like, i could explain a little bit more about why that occurred. when the case was removed   the plaintiffs in this case, unlike plaintiffs in many cases, did not have a preference for state court. there was no attempt to plead around removal. and the case was removed, and it was an arguably correct removal. and plaintiffs' counsel were then in the position, unfortunately, due to  
that directs the general accounting office, first, to study the amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party. in this statute, only the parents could be the awarding   the prevailing party because, unlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street and provides only for awards to parents. and secondly, it says that for   for the  
i don't think so, justice ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that   that i think that the government would have had almost no ability to invoke a totten-type defense in webster or in a title vii case is because of its course of dealing with its employees. and i suppose that if the agency completely changed its course of dealing with respect to its employees or entered a very different course of dealing with certain select employees, then a totten defense might become available in those circumstances. but as i indicated earlier, i think if you look at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones, that's a very different relationship than the agency has with respect to espionage agents. and again, that's because they enter contracts with them. each side has certain litigation rights, and i think it would be a bit of a stretch for the government to come in and say that there's an implied term of that employment agreement that forecloses a judicial remedy.
but the difficulty i think we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity issue and the standard to which you are   are adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise unless we first assume that there is   that there is a constitutional violation.
so did the tax court judge  
yes your honor. the   and, in fact, the court has, in franklin versus linite, said that they have not distinguished between different forms of character evidence. and i understand that, in the past, we've always discussed background and character evidence as sort of the same thing. in this case, however, the ninth circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a distinction between different forms of backward-looking and forward-looking character  
what   what is the answer to my question? because i do think it turns on this. a lot does. the trial judge sat there and said this is very important. dr. blake is quoting from something called part 5, which i thought was his report. and then the trial judge says, where did you get that idea? where did you get that idea, that the   that the enzyme wasn't there in   in the jeans' blood? where did you get it? and he says i got it from the fbi report, i think. he's not certain because he's remembering his own conclusion. he isn't quite sure where he got it from. and now it turns out that the inc when they   it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much enzyme there. and then they say, well, maybe it meant inconclusive. and he says, that wouldn't matter because i guess i took it to mean that too would show there wasn't much enzyme there. both would come to the same thing. and now, if i'm sitting there and thinking, i'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this enzyme in the   in the blood that's right there. easiest thing in the world to prove. and if somebody is going to dispute it, the state will come back and say, no, no, the enzyme is there. but they didn't. so i read the testimony and i read the fact that you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's saying, yes, the enzyme is not there.
well, no, i've got that part. but the   and   and you're right about that part. but that   you know, that doesn't get over the   the hump here i think because of the   what we've written. the   i mean, where i'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases. and prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't   that 1983 applies here i think probably   i can't guarantee it   but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there   where it doesn't seem to make difference there. and now i'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose i say i see your point, i think you're right. now, what   what is your recommendation? what do we change? do we change the word necessary in balisok, which i'd be pretty reluctant to do? or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?
yes.
why do you   why do you put that in a separate category? it's kind of unusual for congress to put that type of a requirement in the statute. they could have normally   i suspect they normally would write it. you know, you   you   they're excludable only if the court finds in the interest of justice. but they went further and they said if the court sets forth orally or in writing in the record of the case. i mean, they set it forth as a separate requirement. i don't know that we can give it sort of a second-class status.
we thought we would not seek further monetary relief.
maybe the judge is reading. a judge doesn't watch   watch the witness 100 percent of the time. that's not credible.
the  
your honor, it's simply categories in there. we submit  
well, because   courts of appeals official have been doing that for years. there have been a lot   you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight cause, then the defendant gets slight cause. so that's a ruling that's been rendered for years and years. is that the most sensible way? i don't know. i think it would make sense for this court to address the more fundamental issue of rogers. because i think it is an important issue that needs to be decided. i don't think the court needs to decide it. i do think it has been thoroughly vetted for the court on both sides, and it would certainly provide significant guidance to the lower courts.
well right, but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out. instead what, a screening function turns into an editing function. the district court is supposed to just excise out the unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to continue.
is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the delaware case?
so   so these are modest.
can i just follow up on that?
  it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not   and the reason i turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets  
do we know the race of the school board here? i mean, that was not   how do we know these are benign school boards? is it stipulated that they are benign school boards?
well, somebody will be if it's random. if you have thousands of people, somebody will be if it is random. if there were nobody who was picked seven times, that would show it wasn't random. so, you know  
they're for different purposes.
yes, but a common, isn't the common motive consistent, just as consistent with no agreement as with agreement? in other words, they didn't have to agree; their common motive was operative agreement or not?
that's a different   that's a different reason. that's a merits defense. i just wondered if  
i understood the statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed after passing the anatomical landmark.
what can we do about that?
well, then   then you're not relying on morgan ii.
no. i'm not saying that, justice kennedy. i'm saying that the court isn't confronted in this case with a situation in which threats not to the person but to property or the need to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are present.
well, that's sort of reading the statute just to achieve a result.
but   but are you saying  
that's why they didn't  
may i ask you if you agree with general cruz, that if the results of the 20   section   district 23 violated section 2, it would not be a defense that was politically motivated?
absolutely. all that i am maintaining is that they would not be justified under a safety exigency to go in. certainly to   as far as disturbing the peace, then yes, but not where the proffered justification is safety.
you said in your brief that the remedy, if the petitioner wants to assure he's going to get chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert   direct review from the state court's conviction. did you say that?
justice alito, we   we don't have those   those facts here.
what did the special  
that's just not true. every day states and localities around the country are imposing use restrictions. they tell   they tell applicators and users when and where to apply the pesticide and what types of  
  you would say, i'm not challenging the right of the   as a member of this religious sect. i just say, me too.
our   our primary position is that issue preclusion does not apply for the same reasons that this court found that issue preclusion did not apply in england when you were required to do two separate litigations. the question of whether the ninth circuit correctly applied issue preclusion law   we also raise that as our last argument in our opening brief, but our primary argument here today is that issue preclusion should not apply at all to federal  
have the countries of the european union abolished the death penalty by popular vote?
it   it is our position in this case no because the ditch next to the site has not been regulated under the rules adopted by the respondent and   nor under the statute adopted by congress. the ditch is   has been historically designated as a point source or a source point, as has been the drain under the statute. in 1975, after the district court ruled that the respondent's rules were too narrow from a jurisdictional standpoint, the respondent then expanded its rules in 1975. in the preamble to those rules, it specifically stated that ditches   ditches of this nature, drainage ditches, were specifically exempted as waters of the united states. that is in the preamble. we then go to 19  
however, in the context of incarceration, a sacrifice of the right to assembly, the right to correspond in certain circumstances, to contact visits are things which are well within the ambit of what a prison needs to control.
yes, your honor. the   this court's decisions have struck a balance between respecting the need for the states to obey federal law and, at the same time, respecting the constitutional value of the states' sovereign immunity. what we have here in   with respect to the automatic stay and with respect to the discharge decisions, is states being bound by federal law, no different than the states being bound by the minimum wage law, for example. but what we have with respect to the trustee's attempts to augment the estate by collecting a monetary judgment against the states is an attempt to invade the state treasury, which this court's decisions clearly state is barred by sovereign immunity.
yes, i know it happens.
to be sure, this court could certainly determine that the vienna convention gives rises to the individual rights. that interpretation, however, would conflict with the express language of the preamble to the treaty, and would also conflict with the consistent position of the executive branch since 1969, when this treaty was ratified. for those 36 years, the state department has consistently answered the question, that the vienna convention does not give rise to individual rights. and, indeed  
no, your honor. that would be contrary to the express statutory scheme in michigan.
the trouble with your a fortiori argument it seems to me is this: if we accept your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial. and if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove the element, then it can either be thrown out because an element has not been proven or he can go back and revive official the motion to quash. if on the other hand the government gets its act together at that point and does put in evidence on the element, it's going to be harmless error. and so the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that someone will always be put to trial if there is any question about how the judge should rule on the motion to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will grant the motion to quash and the government can go back to the grand jury and get another indictment. it seems to me that something is seriously lost in that situation if we go your way.
yes. is that what they were joined under?
yeah, other financial relationships with the u.s. government, yes, your honor.
but state law   the supposition is that state law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract. that's the difference between void ab initio and voidable.
yes, but she's not   she's not even going after the assets in this case. she's asserting an in personam claim against the individual. correct?
  under slusa.
but it's clear, counsel, though, that the first prong of m'naghten adds something different, "you don't understand the nature and quality of your acts." in other words, it would be enough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought this was a martian, regardless of whether he knew it was wrong to kill a martian or not.
and you want criminal liability to turn upon that.
that's not discrimination. that is simply the effect of a free choice, and any business is free to make that choice.
that would be different in several respects, mr. chief justice. first of all, there would not be discretion. you wouldn't have the individual officer deciding  
i think i understand. that substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder, mr. james would submit based on the language of the statute, would not qualify and would not create that serious potential risk of physical injury.
right.
yes. and not   and not necessarily  
  it seems to me that's  
isn't the problem that the motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the trial? and we want to induce the court to look very official carefully at it at that point, because if the court is wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a result of it. and the way to induce the court to be very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not harmless error, and you've got to take this very seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error analysis later.
he's asking you, i think, justice alito's question, "do we have to get into that?" so long as this one's okay, why do   why do we have to get into whether there might be some other ones that aren't okay?
and   and is that standard less than going to a jury?
was the predonning waiting issue decided below?
sure. exactly. and that's   and that's why i think that that interpretation of the statute may be correct. but the problem we have here is this is a statute, and why it's unconstitutional is this is a statute that is saying this only with respect to a particular kind of speech. it's saying the union may collect a hundred percent of dues and it may spend them in whatever way it deems appropriate for  
i'm sorry. justice stevens, say it again.
you can   just like a corporation could reincorporate in another state, a bank could move its main office, which i think is the term that's used in 12 u.s.c., section 30.
suppose you were in a halfway house, and the state says, "we're creating a status. one is, you're a prisoner. another is, you're a halfway house. another is, on your   parole. but we want to subject you to suspicionless searches at   in all three stages   prison, halfway house, parole." could they do it for the halfway house?
yes, but that isn't   i take it you don't  
so you're saying it's the facts known to the officer  
right. it's not an issue in this case.
were   were both of the cases cases of the texas court of criminal appeals?
that's correct. sent back  
this court made that observation. it was one of two grounds upon which this court relied in holding that this court would not judicially impose a mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners under that decision. so, the first part of the decision evaluated the text of the former version of 1997(e), and, in the second part of this decision, this court said, "nonetheless, notwithstanding that the statute doesn't expressly require exhaustion, we will not judicially impose exhaustion in this case for the reason that such a requirement would, indeed, represent a possibility of forfeiture of a claim for an inmate's failure to comply with deadlines." and, again, as this court recognized in booth v. churner, that decision is a significant part of the statutory history of this provision, and this court presumed that congress was responding to that decision when it revised 1997(e).
but here it was not a matter of minutes.
  it really isn't.
would you answer my question?
and i'm not sure there's a  
all right.
i'm not quite sure that's right, justice souter, because i think that there's really two ways the government can establish religion. one is they can do it themselves directly. and if they do that, i think that the primary problem is the primary executive branch conduct in doing so. the other way they can establish  
i absolutely disagree with you, justice alito, because keep in mind  
once again  
we submit that the due process error is at the motion to vacate. at that time, again, after taking the position that wesley was the shooter, they came back and urged that   that stumpf was the shooter, that the record was ample enough to support stumpf being the shooter  
like what is his name? i mean, that's the present tense. not what was his name or what will be his name. what is his name? you think that's the present tense. so that shows that this is all seeking help.
that's right. that's correct. but  
no, the district court found that it did not need to resolve whether or not    
the biological mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.
but that's a direct allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.
well, the "in connection"   that's not the approach that the court of appeals took, of course, but   and also, as mr. kasner indicated, that issue has been dispositively resolved by this court and the commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition in section 10(b). and if your interpretation were the one that were adopted, that would not be the case.
you don't know what future speech is going to be. his future thing may be, you know, johnnie cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of san francisco. that would be a   a question of public concern.
as a   i do not agree that it came as a shock. and, in fact, i think that warner jenkinson, which is a second circuit case that allowed this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only cases ever that allowed it. and other reasons were found to dismiss similar kinds of claims. in gen-probe, it was a surprise that a licensee could do this. it   the law   by the time that this license was executed in the federal circuit, there was a case, called shell oil, where the court specifically held that a licensee cannot take advantage of the protections of lear until it has repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it wants to challenge validity. so that was the background rule that was in force at the time of this license. and then, when you couple that with the fact that  
sure, if they want to come in and argue that there is a violation of article 21 of the ucmj, or article 36 of the ucmj, after their conviction, they are perfectly free to do that  
okay.
suppose that everything in this case were the same. everything is identical except what the court of appeals or the state supreme court holds is that we think under rule 403, which happens to be the rule in our state, the probative value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the risk of prejudice. but everything else is the same.
if the government then singled out some of that money  
i think that   i think the reading of the statute is plain. if the distributor took the fuel, kept it, decided to warehouse it because the costs are going up or something like that, it would still have to pay the tax, because the tax is on the receipt by the distributor. in answer to your question, justice stevens, would those other exemptions, the united states government be required by the constitution, or the other states? no, not under this court's decision in the blaze case, which, as i understood it, was unanimous. the fresno case, u.s. vs. new mexico, it's not a tax on the united states. it's   or an agency of the united states. so they wouldn't be required. but they make sense, because the sales to other states are for people that drive on other states' highways. the sales to the united states government is an exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes back. so, there's a rational purpose. it's not discrimination. the tribe makes the point that it's generating real value and reservation value. this is fuel that's used in cars that are   drive all over the state of kansas. the casino is there, so people come to the casino. and, under cabazon, there might be some value added by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value created by an exemption from regulation. but the value for someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car will then drive. and that   cars that drive, in this case, drive on kansas highways. this, ultimately is  
in mullane, it was regular mail. it wasn't certified mail. right?
you have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to  
well, tell us  
in a hypothetical  
thank you, mr. tillinghast. mr. lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left.
  don't you  
all right. if for   somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a state law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in federal court. we didn't want the federal court to review the state court. we wanted our federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the state court suit. it has nothing whatsoever to do with rooker-feldman. it is parallel adjudication, just what he said. now, what's your response?
  can i ask you one question here?
we contend that in this case the removal is invidious because it was latinos that were identified and taken out and then   for incumbency protection, similar to what  
no. i think they would say absolute immunity, not qualified. i   i think they're saying if there's probable cause, the game is over. no   no qualified  
i guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at section 53, which i think is the part dealing with contributory negligence. i don't see anything else. it doesn't speak of causation at all.
ms. smith, could   could you go on to some of the other elements that are contested here? in particular, i'm interested in   in mr. muncey's confession. what   what do you   what do you say about that?
yes, your honor. now, the question is, of course, that's an attack on a probated will, i believe, and i think that this court's jurisprudence also supports the notion that  
so the identical claims have to proceed under two different routes.
  about that, which is what hicks says  
quite the contrary. this is exactly how the state may display the ten commandments.
  discovery that was a merits discovery.
but now you're getting into what has sometimes been called "residual doubt." you point out that a juror asked, "what if it were not unanimous?" and you also pointed out that there was an earlier hung jury in this case. but you didn't argue, below, that residual doubt counts. it's one thing to say, "if defendant argues it, the court should take it into account." but there was no such argument made in this case.
that's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. you decreased it.
thank you, mr. kneedler. ms. robin-vergeer.
  of how definitions work.
yes.
couldn't they have gotten all   wouldn't he have been able to testify to all of that without even entering the home?
well, i think   i think granting a stay could be seen as validating the position of the government without ever having an opinion on it.
was the argument below that     that imposing the sentencing enhancement was unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts didn't support it?
so, if  
your honor, the history of this court's treatment of grand jury is that they may consider any evidence; they may consider  
another way to look at the case is to say that ohio admitted that there were some improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned on the adequacy of the new policies. now, those are two different things. which is this case?
what's wrong with the opinion, your honor, is it still requires a warrant under the situation.
yes, your honor, deterrence is a basis for going to the third tier.
the case is submitted.
but they raise that there is still the question of federal forum over state forum.
it does have to   it does not have to be knowing as to every conceivable aspect of mitigation.
the case is submitted.
well, in the   sometimes despite the court's desire sometimes to have a less separate opinion, sometimes justices do. and what he said here is he was just explaining his reason why he believed that flast was distinguishable from frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have a clear stake because of the threepence comment. justice fortas did say, did have a broader theory, although he   in addition, that the court did not adopt   but he also said, recognizing very similar language to justice stewart, what the court's opinion held. so i think justice stewart's opinion is useful because he doesn't talk about congress, he talks about expenditures.
in other words, you're saying 9 due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you 10 could, in the simple sense, discover it. it applies to a 11 generated fact when you could have generated it.
but you concede that if   if it's a historical tradition to speak in one's own voice, it gets   for practical purposes, it gets a kind of absolute respect. whereas, if it's a historical tradition to choose one's own counsel, it does not get that   i mean, it's very   that seems to me a   a kind of historical dissonance.
i believe that it is, your honor, for the reasons that are laid out in petitioner's brief, but regardless of what the court decides about that question, the treaty of 1838 clearly disestablishes the reservation, which terminates all sovereignty prospectively. the language in the historical context  
and 2680   the introductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to such cases. and is it not true that 2676 is in this chapter, and does it not, therefore, follow that 2676 does not apply to this case?
that's not what advocacy groups are doing. you know, people who want   the wealthy people you're talking about have gone into giving money to 527 unincorporated groups that   that are using issue ads lawfully through that vehicle. but, you know, before this all happened, the 1996 and the record of mcconnell where, all of a sudden, there were more of these issue ads, the record also reflects that there had been issue ads, you know, throughout history. and   and, of course, those were all these efforts to influence the upcoming votes in congress. so that occurred before this effort with sham issue ads. it   it would occur now except that genuine issue advocacy through grassroots lobbying is now swept in under the reason that it might have an incidental effect on elections. this court just simply needs to recognize that there's more to government than elections, and even more importantly than elections is the lawmaking function and that   that people should not be disabled from using most effective means to influence that law-making with   on the basis that simply there's an election coming up. i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
i'm not sure i can answer right   i believe the instruction mentioned handgun. the instruction  
  out of the dealership business.
i'm not sure whether it   it would have an obligation to use the most humane method under the eighth amendment because this court's cases have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of pain is barred by the eighth amendment. i'm not aware of any cases  
your honor  
you're raising a provision that says just that, it's the absence of a provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.
i thought that the standing requires imminent harm. if you haven't been harmed already, you have to show the harm is imminent. is this harm imminent?
i don't think so, your honor. what we are talking about here are claims at the outer boundaries of patentability, even under the federal circuit's test. and in those cases there will no doubt be some claims, such as the claim in this case that can be resolved at summary judgment by a court, that the court can simply determine as a matter of law, it's obvious. whereas under the federal circuit's test it has to go to a jury and the somewhat unpredictable, at the least  
well, let's look at the way that equipoise can happen under the kansas statute   and i think justice alito alluded to it   that if the jurors can't decide between aggravated and mitigating circumstances, the sentence is death. the statute decrees death, and  
mr. madden, that's certainly an admirable goal. could a local unit, a municipality, or even a state have another goal? let's say what used to be great about the united states was the presence of various ethnic groups. i mean, there were the pennsylvania dutch, there were the amish, there were little italy's, there were chinatowns, and these things are beginning to disappear. and we think that we should encourage the continuation of that diversity, as the federal government has done with respect to american indian tribes. and therefore, we're going to use public funds for such things as street festivals, a chinatown street festival, an italian street festival. we're going to encourage those organizations that maintain that separateness. is there anything unconstitutional about that objective?
so perhaps the court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of rooker-feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided. it is claim-precluded. that's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do. so in that context, maybe this court used the wrong word. maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded. why do you need to interject the word review? isn't that   unless you're going to say every time court a decides a case and then you're in court b and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is   has been litigated and decided in court one.
thank you, general. ms. dalven, we'll hear now from you.
yes, sir, justice stevens.
yes, your honor.
what i'm now saying is i can understand exactly why you might feel the way you do. but our job is to not necessarily take that feeling. but shouldn't we presume that the state will administer words that comport with the basic elements, not every detail as you want, but they will administer this new policy in accord with those basic elements of fairness? isn't that giving a   sort of like a deference to the state, which maybe we should?
yes.
well  
in 8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(43)(b), what, in your view, does the first phrase, "illicit trafficking in a controlled substance," add to the reference to a drug-trafficking crime  
the answer is yes.
it doesn't   it doesn't have to be made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be made at any time after the opposing party has had an adequate opportunity to be heard. and so  
i believe that's correct, your honor.
were there any   were there any state decisions, or federal court decisions for that matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of   i don't know   professional class versus working class or something like that?
  right. that is exactly right. but the other answer, justice scalia, is that to get to that result   and i think it's remarkable that both petitioners' counsel stood up here, and the way they framed the question was, "this is just remedial for these actual constitutional violations in prison." to get to that result, you would have to rewrite the ada in a way that would make the reasonable-modification or reasonable-accommodations provision basically an empty vessel to put whatever constitutional law you want in  
johnson v. zerbst, i believe, was in the '30s.
i never heard of a point on the merits that if you   you think you're right. it's right on the merits, the element of the offense. you don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you don't raise that in the appeal.
so you   you think that the person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating the vessel, is not covered by the jones act?
what was it?
we believe this is in a sense the equivalent of a welfare benefit.
so  
your honor, i think that it would make sense because the statute requires it, and as a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, because the only category of cases in which the result would change under our test is the category in which as a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are required under graham, as a matter of law the court concludes that the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot be given the protection of a patent. and in those circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play. it's a legal determination; the presumption has been understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the federal circuit's view the measure of the burden of proof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the underlying factual considerations, not the ultimate legal determination. but one of the problems with the federal circuit's test is that it transforms what this court made clear in graham is supposed to be a legal determination. ultimately it transforms it into a jury question. because in a case like this one where you have as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts saying "oh, this would not have been obvious." and that in the court of appeals view is enough to create a jury question and then you then have to role the dice in front of a jury in each one of these cases, except of course the many cases in which the challenger can't meet the teaching suggestion motivation test at all and simply is unable to challenge the validity of the patent, notwithstanding this court's holding in graham that it's ultimately a legal determination   admittedly one informed by detailed factual inquiries. another problem with the federal circuit's test is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory focus and this court's focus in graham on the capabilities of the person of ordinary skill.
he could have asked for a heat of passion instruction, but  
  to say that a patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the misuse context and then just turn around and say, but if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it is sufficient as a presumption?
at   at least   my understanding is at least the fbi and perhaps the commissioner of ins at the time for   perhaps at the request of other agencies. it appears that all three agencies had the ability to create this exception to the normal immigration procedure. if the does can show on remand that the cia's regulations are as they allege and that pl-110 status generally, which is what the cia witness mcnair basically said, that many pl-110 resettlees are in continued danger because of the nature of which we brought them in, regardless of what they did before we decided to bring them in, or if they can show that in their particular situation there is a   a special relationship of danger created, we believe we would have a substantive due process argument and a procedural due process argument. that is not today's question. the government has agreed that for purposes of today's question, it should be assumed that we can make out a due process claim. that claim is  
thank you, general. general clement.
no, it would not have. bit that's because of the peculiarities of the difference between original jurisdiction under the fsia, section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the fsia. whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a conclusion that the defendant is not immune, congress conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign sovereign is defended.
so it seems to me that that is the difficult part of your case based on this evidence.
in  
might be a virginia resident.
mr. salmons, may i ask you this   this question? if you'd been the prosecutor in this case and you had   knew that the evidence would be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation, would you have conceded that there was a constitutional violation in this case?
the statute doesn't give a great deal of specific  
and is it collected by the wholesaler?
what does it mean?
this is very helpful to me, because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case, and i think you're endorsing the court of appeals.
earlier you   you suggested that in your view the district court could deny it.
that's where i am not understanding your argument. there is an iep in all of these cases. i would understand your argument if the state   the school district said, "we're not going to educate this kid. throw him into the pot with everybody else. we won't give you an iep." that's not what we've got here. and, in fact, if that's what we had here, the burden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because the state   the parents would walk in, and the only thing they'd have to do to satisfy "a" burden of proof would be to say, "they didn't come up with an iep."
then i   i wish we'd stick to this case.
i'm sorry. it was   it's the same situation there. the question is, where does the relevant sale take place? and it takes place   in the virginia/illinois situation, the sale takes place in virginia, which is why you don't pay illinois sales tax, though you may pay virginia use tax. it would be the same thing in the tribal situation. the sale in that place, just like the sale in central machinery, takes place on the reservation. and what this court said, in central machinery, is that a sale to a tribe of goods on the reservation is   cannot be taxed by the state. and, indeed, because this tax is on the sale on the reservation, the broader balancing principles apply. the tribe here has imposed the   its tax on a tribal station, on a tribal land, right where this court has said its tribal taxing authority is strongest, and has dedicated those revenues to improving the miles of dirt and gravel road on the reservation.
well  
but just realizes this person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the   in the pattern of challenges. would that be a justified challenge?
and   and that is a future event.
so you would say at the threshold level, there's no taking.
but, mr. porter  
the enterprise alleged here, mr. chief justice, is actually not a single corporation. that first list would not encompass a group of corporations. a group of corporations is actually not a single legal entity. it's a group of legal entities that have combined to commit a pattern of racketeering activity. it doesn't neatly fit into the first definition, which seems to encompass only single entities. and so every single circuit court in the   in the country to examine this question has held that congress didn't expect, anticipate, or intend to exclude groups of legal entities from being   being a   a rico enterprise. they were captured by the second part of the definition.
how do we know that?
in this case with the allegations of the nature of the conspiracy that precede that sentence, it's enough.
i think those are essentially the two choices, with one caveat. we would call it an accrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the reason that this court has always respected the tolling rules that states have whereas accrual is a federal question. but with that slight caveat, i do believe that those are the two main options. but i don't believe the court should be indifferent as between them. there are very serious practical reasons weighing down on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and filing not immediately, of course   the case need only be filed within the period of the statute of limitations. thereafter it might well be that some cases, maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a stay of some sort while the federal   excuse me   while the criminal case is ongoing. but that question, figuring out whether a stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether it's critical evidence, whether there was other evidence.
i think i am. the answer is  
well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development. do you   do you think that the efficacy of the drug being suggested plays a role in the ind application?
but it isn't up to the court of appeals to make some kind of roving inquiry of who would have been a better defendant. it just seems to me the fourth circuit rule is totally unworkable and unprecedented. i don't see how you can possibly overcome that, because the plaintiff is the master of its complaint, and it can decide who to sue. and lincoln was sued as a corporation, and i don't see what business it is of a court to say, "oh, it should have been somebody else."
i   i would  
  this is a  
why is that a reasonable assumption in response to their argument?
i think he could, justice stevens. as i understand  
but  
thank you, counsel. mr. bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.
thank you, miss mahoney. the case is submitted.
for how long after the judgment becomes final can a court engage in sua sponte consideration of whether to grant a rehearing?
  then we're arguing about words.
the prior regulations were promulgated when?
the claim was   the $3 million claim was not the amount claimed in the original lawsuit, which never got to the point of a claim being made. it was for damages in excess of diversity limits, the   for diversity of citizenship limits. there was not a $10 million lawsuit or a $20 million lawsuit or an $8 million lawsuit. the $3 million figure  
well, i   i don't see why i can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere else, justice stevens. we think that congress, in this action, did not do anything that triggers the suspension of the writ. but if you think that  
  let us look to and what kinds of things not? all we're interested in is what was he charged with, which of these three things.
meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds. i used to each contracts. meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.
these are in the joint appendix.
didn't we take a position in abood?
it's a fair trial. nobody is saying it wasn't a fair trial, but he didn't have the lawyer he wanted. i mean, we could assure everybody a fair trial by allowing nobody to pick their lawyers and assigning lawyers to everybody. that would   that would accomplish fair trials throughout the united states, but that's not the system we have. you're   you're entitled to the lawyer that you want.
okay, i see. you say double. both the income is earned by the attorney, and at that stage the client does virtually nothing. so it's the reverse of the earls or the lucases where the husband was doing the work and the wife is getting the income. it would be as if the wife was doing all the work and the husband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.
  arizona.
i don't think so, justice ginsburg. i think in order for the total exhaustion issue to be moot, the heightened pleading requirement would have to be resolved against petitioner jones, and the naming the defendants issue would have to be resolved in favor of williams and walton. i charted out on a matrix and verified it a couple of times. turning to the naming issue if i could, since we haven't addressed that, the prison litigation reform act simply sets a floor of how much specificity a prisoner must provide in his or her grievance. it does not require what the sixth circuit held here which is that as a matter of federal statutory law a prisoner must have identified every individual who he or she later sues in federal court. this is a kind of endemic, or flows logically from the court's decision in woodford v. ngo. woodford v. ngo says that prisoners must comply with grievance procedures.
and you say the attorney general of the united states could not deem it to be drug abuse under the act if a state allowed that for recreational use or to cure depression or   how about steroids for bodybuilders?   and decided that's perfectly okay. now, can the attorney general find that that's drug abuse?
i see.
well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.
no, but as to who did it and whether hurtz did it or whether   remember, what the defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or someone else is what we don't know. again, this is federal habeas corpus before this court, and i don't think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this court has in chambers, holmes, or any of the cases that were involved, was so   that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years after the crime. and yes, the jury   it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time. but at the end of the day, they were unanimous. there's nothing close about unanimous. and i think it would be the wrong message to say that a jury that works as hard as this one did, did the readbacks, culled through this record  
i wasn't  
the  
well, as i understand it, in some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge, there isn't any river down there. it's dry. it's   the bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by the impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were, taking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it into a river   putting the spoonful back into a river that's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there, as a result of your dam.
i agree. in   and atkinson trading makes clear that, even when the great bulk of the land is owned by the tribe or its members, the tribe's ability to regulate conduct on the non-indian parcels is sharply limited. that would be doubly true in a tract of this nature. but to return to the point about the state's reliance interest, i think it's   or the city's reliance interest   i think it's important to stress that this case is only about taxation, and a municipality can't claim to have the same sort of reliance interest in being able to tax that a potential defendant in a  
the   the only reason he would know that duty is because every   every property tax form has on it a change of address at the very bottom of it that's perforated. so every time you get a tax form, you get a thing that says change your   let me know if you've changed your address.
all questions, which were mixed questions of law and fact, where this court took the words, took the facts, and made a rule. and that's this case.
well  
yes.
no, they are   and i may have been misleading. the jurors are expressly instructed that is   that it is their duty to determine, and their only duty to determine, whether the defendant should receive life or death and parole, and   or life without the possibility of parole   and in  
that   that would be the theory under the ninth circuit.
how is the blue brief in response to respondent's argument?
yes, your honor, and to us that proves that congress knows how to distinguish between experts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to.
within the other facts that i was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here that competition as a clec would have been, in the absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege here, would have been a profitable endeavor.
i think to an extent there is a differentiation because this court has made clear that any assessment must depend on context. there is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context one must both look at the purpose and the effect. in gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation history, the social facts, the content and any changes. here the district court had not only the display itself but it had the announced purpose of the county. it therefore was in a unique position to gauge the purpose of the   the true purpose of these counties. moreover, it was in a unique position to gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in these small rural kentucky counties, the reasonable observer assessment of this particular display. and the court   mccreary county is a county with only 17,000 people. whitley city, the county seat, which is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people. the district court from its chambers in london, kentucky was well situated to gauge whether or not the reasonable observer, knowing the litigation history of this case and knowing the changes in the forum and the context of this display, would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of history or simply the third in a series of efforts by this county government to post the ten commandments because that is what it wanted to post.
yes, but we're still going to have to write something.
and i understand that. and you'd have to conclude, for them to win   but suppose i did conclude   suppose, for hypothetical   the sake of   for   as a hypothetical, suppose i thought, yes, this does include the safety part, looking at how effective drugs are, too. suppose i concluded that the statute meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary laboratory that didn't have the special certificate? suppose i concluded that, indeed, you could look well in advance of the clinical test period to get the information for the ind? and suppose i concluded that sometimes, where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do. if i concluded that   and i'm not saying i would   then would you concede that a directed verdict would have been appropriate against you?
even though she's assigned the cause of action to the state?
no, i think it would probably be inside the rule. i think   i would think, particularly for a   for an assistant da to make a recommendation about the consequences of illegal conduct would be within his   within his job duties. i also want to say that this court's decision in pickering, and in that line of cases, i think, fully support this, because, as this court pointed out in connick, this court has repeatedly stated that the protection afforded by pickering is for action taken as a citizen on matters of public concern. that "as a citizen" phrase was reiterated in virtually all of this court's cases in the area. and the underlying principle is that  
she's consenting. it's an intrusion, in the one case, on the conversation; in the other case, on the home. in the telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the consent of one party subjects the other to having the conversation monitored. in this case, the consent of one party subjects the other party to the search.
but just   just have it   just   whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. this whole court's jurisprudence since the new deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.
right.
may i ask this  
he   he is a subordinate because as the government keeps telling us, the tax court judge is the only official spokesman for the court. they get to make the final judgment. and the tax court judge reviews what the stj has done.
this is an academic question because he would have an offsetting theft loss.
so why don't we at least hear from the eeoc? that has happened in other cases where the department of justice and the eeoc take different positions, at least the eeoc filed a brief even though it wasn't the government's brief.
why? because the language, i don't see anywhere in the statute where   the words of modification are, it's a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant. now those words, "physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant," could mean different things in different places.
may i ask this?
i mean, my own  
but considered  
yes, yes.
even  
i don't think it's really up to the government. the defendant can seek mandamus, and if the  
but if the   the third   the third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but i take it you would agree that it is still the decision of the defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime.
that's perhaps so, your honor, and that's one thing   thing that, whatever rule you craft, you need to be very careful of and that is preventing gamesmanship on   on the part of attorneys and criminal defendants so that these vienna convention claims are not raised after the fact, which is another reason to   to  
under any standard that looks to the substantive lines on the map, anything that   and we have spent hours racking our brains trying to think of a standard for litigation purposes that would yield the old map being more fair than the new one. we're not aware of any coherent standard that looks to substance.
may i ask you this question? isn't it true that under some of the other references they refer to a constitutional right?
i think that would be contrary, however, mr. chief justice, to the previous holdings of this court where they say you do look to the logical deductions  
what is it?
some   some of our brethren don't   don't agree with it. they don't like the residue and would limit it to the eleventh amendment.
well, justice o'connor, i don't think upon analysis it is, and i think there's a couple of reasons why that's so. first of all, this is not an absolute entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every day. it is a balancing test, and i think things like getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison walls would not satisfy the test.
but the police officer who testified to what she said and what he wrote down in the affidavit that she signed, that does get in.
in the criminal  
  search is reasonable. reasonableness, or course, is a balance  
what other aspects of title vii do you think are jurisdictional?
we've done it before, there's no doubt about it. but the better practice usually is to have a case in which the issue really presents the hard question. and you're asking us to make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to official allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for example, which has a different atmosphere to the whole case when you're facing that kind of an issue.
  the special reasons. but   but i   but i   let me   let me   let me answer your question  
justice scalia, i concede that the court has accurately characterized the opinion. if i remember the cases cited by the opinion, they're concrete tie and hines, which lead directly back to the louie opinion, which was the decided at the behest of the government, because, in louie, there was a law enforcement operator who   a law enforcement official who failed to stop a drunk driver, and they said, "there is"   the government said, "there is no private person here." and, therefore, if you look to washington state law, which does not impose liability in these circumstances, you get a good idea of what washington law would rule if there were a private person.
why is that true? i mean, it depends. i suppose it may be harder for the company to mount a defense over time, so it may be to her advantage to wait.
right, and that is their position. and that position accords   yes, that is their position. and that accords no particular  
okay.
what if it's the case  
their   well, your honor, respectfully, congress created two doors. and they have a   a door which is the door that existed under the constitution, which is article iii jurisdiction. you can come in as a diversity plaintiff into   into the courthouse. now, congress says there's another door. congress went through and cleaned up 200 years of federal court jurisprudence. and incidentally, it is anathema to law professors who have written books and tomes and lectured to law students, your honor, who don't understand what they're reading. the notion that in 1367 in one page, congress could write down everything you needed to know about supplemental jurisdiction is horrifying to a host of law professors  
there wasn't any question that   that it was the right or the   that the defendant was a wrong defendant or that  
well, your honor, the rule says that it can be made up to 10 days  
that   that   excuse me. that's when the united states ratified the treaty, 1969.
well   well, whatever it is, he   generally they are not silent when the judge says i think step one has been met. i want to be sure understand california's position on one point. is it your view in   in california that the judge must decide himself that it is more likely than not that   that discrimination is present before you proceed to step two?
absolutely, yes, it would.
can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?
with its principal place of business in the united states.
i think leaving it to rule 15 is one way to do it. and doing it in these particular cases is another way. giving the courts discretion to raise the  
well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. if you look at page 15a of the appendix to   to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. you have to look at the particular context in which this statute  
i've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record. and what i've had a hard time finding in the record is what i think there must be some material that the state or somebody in a tourist office or a guide or somebody tells people what the 17 different monuments are. and all i've found is the general brochure which doesn't tell them what they are. and i found something on the internet. well, which is in the record. but aside from this page from the internet in the record and that, is there anything else in this record that if somebody wanders around, they're on the state grounds, they say, what is this, what are these things anyway? there must be something that tells them. and where is it?
the   the numbers are in the stipulation.
  may i ask you a question about the federal exemption? in your view, is that made available at the time of the initial purchase by the distributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit later on?
but a background rule is awfully tough. i mean, you could have lots of shalls in all kinds of statutes. if they said shall, the sanitation department shall inspect your home for tuberculosis, maybe that does give a right. if they say to the fire department, you shall put out fires, i wouldn't think they meant that every possible homeowner had a right to a lawyer and a full judicial hearing before they go and respond to an alarm. you know, i mean, it depends on the area. i don't know how to create a background rule.
no, but i mean, once it didn't come to a head in november and it was still an issue, why didn't you continue to run it?
yes, but it is limited to the right of self-representation for his defense, just as his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of counsel for his defense.
  as you express it, "mooting the case"?
of course.
correct.
is the rationale for the rule that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to minimize the exposure to   of our judges so that they   the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that   that are paid to our own government? i'm serious about that. is that the rationale?
the   the statute talks about costs, but the state has never interpreted that term to mean just sort of the out-of-pocket   those kinds of inchoate costs, and they usually talk about very specific costs like the cost of noticing publication and other   you know, other items that you can   you know, where you have a receipt.
but it's defenseless under the present law?
i think that's a fair comment. and let   let me say there are two   there are many ways that you can do that, justice scalia, and two of them were readily available to the state in this case. one is even when a witness goes missing or is unwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be other ways to prove the case. here, the caller said  
i don't because  
justice scalia, the way you know is because you look at the logical deductions that can be drawn from the congressional statutes, as this court suggested in aldinger. and with respect to the other definitions, i cannot speak categorically with respect to those other definitions because that's not the matter before this court. i can't suggest to this court a wholesale general policy of these definitions are jurisdictional and these definitions are not jurisdictional.
well, i think this is precise and clear. based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming mr. cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him  
but assuming in those cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as i'm assuming your answer to justice kennedy's question, that the normal practice is you don't bother because there is not enough involved?
well, and i appreciate that, your honor, because let me start with the first premise. three law professors didn't write this article   didn't write this language. that's incorrect. the article is written by a subcommittee of the federal courts study committee that was chaired by judge posner. judge posner is the author of one of the decisions that affirms the   has the same view as the eleventh circuit. judge posner had a member of his subcommittee, mr. kastenmeier, who was a representative who just so happened to be chairman of the senate judiciary subcommittee that presented this language. what happened  
well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that count as a violation?
and i suppose you could add to that, that mr. himmelfarb wouldn't even accept "reasonable." he said it has to be "impossible" to comply with.
well, are those 15 places   do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses? do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?
yes, sir.
how is that different from the separate but equal argument? in other words, it doesn't matter that they're being assigned on the basis of their race because they're getting the same type of education.
  the percentages are very small.
it was directly quoted. the ultimate opinion, with regard to the mitigator, was directly quoted. but the   the point that i was making earlier, this deposition in no way renders the   the defendant ineligible for the death penalty because it does not undermine any of the three aggravating circumstances. it does not even make a prima facie showing of insanity under tennessee law, as i've stated earlier. it simply tracked the mitigating circumstance under the statute, and as this court held in sawyer v. whitley, simply additional mitigating circumstances does not rise to the level of innocence of the death penalty. so it neither   it demonstrates neither innocence of the   the offense or of the death penalty. and even more so than that, it would not have even defeated  
well, that is precisely what we believe the oregon supreme court did here. when it talked about how highly reprehensible this was, extraordinary by any measure, it said those concerns override ratio by which they meant single digit ratios.
  where   where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into? but   but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to   to meet the contractual obligations. it seems to me a   a strange way to run a railroad.
  basically, "purge the files."
but they are regulations that the   that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal relationship  
well, counsel, just take it in   in an abstract way. if you think that the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in power, are you saying that when that shift in power in the statewide offices changes, that the new party in power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its predecessor?
yes.
thank you, counsel. mr. zas, you have 4 minutes remaining.
  if it really wanted to?
yes.
mr. gornstein, do you agree that just because it's a compensable activity doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a break in the workday? people have talked about the dog example, and there are others. i mean, and   so, all you're talking about is the determination that this is a principal activity. it seems that there's a separate   second question, which is, how do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, and they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?
but, in morrison, did the court's opinion not say that congress cannot justify commerce cause   clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? i mean, the court certainly made that statement.
okay. bottom line under my reading of turner and safley is that there has to be first that logical connection under the first prong. but that's not a   an imperative  
well, we have the check already that these are   these are places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together. so  
yes, your honor. the ninth circuit.
i do not. i do not concede it.
would a state court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?
yes, i think  
don't you?
  so that a burglar could be searched for burglar tools  
thank you, mr. stancil.
yes, so  
well, maybe they don't know the leaks. the only thing they can prove is that there was a gross false statement at the time they bought the stock and they don't know what happened to the decline. later on they find out that it gradually leaked out. do they have to prove exactly how the information became public?
what about the solicitor general's reference with respect to the differing protocols on dilation which suggests a different intent going into the procedure for the d&e and d&x?
is there any doubt about that?
i'm sorry, your honor.
could they have said in the ad, call your elected representatives, not naming any names?
well, in this case the immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the government forthrightly said at the beginning right in terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope of his employment. secondarily, as you said, the government in effect elaborated on that and said the reason he was not acting outside the scope of his employment is that these acts which would have been outside scope didn't happen. why is that any different from the claim in the chief justice's hypo that there was no intent to harm?
what is the reason?
all right. so, if balancing  
how is your statement that you just made consistent with the court's holding under the taylor line of cases?
it's the difference between acknowledgment and endorsement. of course counties and other governments can acknowledge the role that religion played in history. that is very different from acknowledging religion as a general matter and asserting that a specific code that is central to specific religions is the one   not only the one religious source but the one source, religious or moral, that provide   religious or secular that provides the moral background of the declaration of independence.
  principles  
i thought they were just cheating the state. what was specifically directed at the customers of your store?
well, in st. cyr  
once you get out of the sphere of   of kind of sham ads that just hit you in your face, there isn't a practical way to tell the difference. there isn't a kind of magic formula. we rejected the magic word, or congress rejected the magic word's approach. and therefore, congress came up with a rule that it did within certain time limits, identified candidates, identified audiences. you can't do it within this period of time unless you do it through a pac. what is different in your case from those paradigm examples in   in mcconnell?
you're assuming they're not in competition on a continuing basis, they're only in competition for one isolated transaction after another.
i think you would say they were irrelevant, justice stevens, and that's because  
respectfully, your honor, not with respect to the medical emergency exception. i think that was true with respect to the spousal notice provision, but not at all with respect to the medical emergency exception. in this case, it was   we're talking about the same conditions that were in casey and here as well. and actually here there were additional considerations because in casey, there was a medical emergency definition that extended to some health threatening circumstances and here there is none.
what about  
but there's beyond and there's way beyond and there's beyond the pale. and i think if you look at all these things that were said in this case   i have read hundreds of these arguments   no conscientious prosecutor could have thought that this was appropriate.
gwinnett   franklin versus gwinnett county.
for, you know, using the mails or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of taxes?
5520, a school policy of the board that says emphatically that political speech is protected, embracing tinker.
and   and  
  your honor, we would prefer the "almost always."
well, we can also say   we can also say that irrespective of whether the federal courts collect it or the state courts collect it, it's still going to end up in the federal treasury, and that these are  
is that because  
once again, that may be, but after casey, i don't think one can plausibly argue that the salerno standard is the correct standard. whatever their position may be, whatever fractions of substantiality may mean.
not contract. i mean, the historic rule is that the government is not bound by statutes of limitations, because what it's doing is enforcing the law in the public interest. now, in 1966, congress enacted section 2415(a) so that there would prospectively be a contract limitations period. but it's strictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and the importance of enforcing the law in the public interest. so that's why we do have a strict construction canon here. as a  
so is the answer   in   in case the court does not agree with you, can you then say, i would like to resurrect rule of reason or do you agree with your adversary that   that that's out of the case because you forfeited it?
thank you, ms. mahoney. ms. vullo.
in this case, it actually   the decision of the respondent did displace the state. the state, after years of examination and determination of impact, made a decision to issue a wetland permit to this project and, in doing so, found specifically that the issuance of the permit would be better, effective method of dealing with pollution than not issuing the permit. that was the specific finding made by the administrative law judge in that appendix, and those findings are the first part of the appendix in this case, detailed findings after a 2-week administrative trial where witnesses were cross- examined and examined. in this case, the respondent has ignored those state powers given to its traditional waters and has said, we're going to ignore, number one, your claim of jurisdiction, and number two, we're going to ignore your finding of no impact and completely disregard that. so, in fact, the framework in this case did shift. the state did what it was supposed to do under 1251(b) and the   the respondent in this case usurped that responsibility and those traditional powers granted to it traditionally and both by this statute, and then determined that what the state of michigan did had no relevance. it was unwarranted. so the framework in this case did specifically change. and in doing so, we get back to those same factual findings they've made. we are here only today because they found that it is adjacent to a ditch which they have said is not a waters of the united states. so in this case, the  
you've mainly attacked the plan as a whole in your briefs. and i'm wondering. i often look at particular districts, as you may know. are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that are plaintiffs?
the state maintains, justice souter, that the decision that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors is a decision, and it is a  
it   it came forward at the   at the hearing regarding the public records that it was going to be the sims   that it was going to be the sims procedure.
the value of finality is what is really at stake here.
i thought their answer on that was that sometimes the d&e procedure will lead to a d&x procedure, but that the requirement of deliberately and intentionally removes those situations from the scope of the statute.
yes. the principal instructed him to do so and he did.
and you don't agree that that necessarily makes it valid, that that's necessarily a defense to section 2.
well, the argument on the other side, as i understand it, is that the   the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is   is relevant. it has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. what   what is your answer to that?
  take the case in which the employee says, "it was accurate." the employer says, "no, it was stupid. you got everything wrong." i take it, in   your position is that regardless of whether the employee got it right or not, there shouldn't be protection, because it's within job duties. is  
thank you, counsel. ms. millett.
  it's within the exception. and, yes, there are fine lines, as with any of these distinctions. in practice   in practice   for the practical reason that you don't have the sheer volume of claims, against which the postal service is largely defenseless, that you have when you start talking  
  with all due respect, your honor, that's a real-world example.
is there   is there   i mean, you're giving me the answer i thought the other side would give me. all right? and i appreciate it actually. (laughter.)
mr. frederick, may i just follow up on justice breyer's question? it seems to me that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the apple because you   all the way along, you might win. and if you won, then it wouldn't matter. if you lose, you always have the argument that you've made here, let's go back and start over again.
but what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue.
not of autumn   not of autumn bockting. but the important point that i want to make before i reserve the balance of my time is that the question isn't simply, is crawford accuracy-enhancing? the question is is it a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished. in other words must all  
so then it doesn't matter what's being said.
i took a liberty there with the justice. i don't think you can ascribe a percentage to it. i think  
  the california supreme court says, "despite all of these, in this kind of a situation, we think a year is a reasonable time"  
may i ask you this question? with a warrant to conduct a wiretap, does the warrant just merely specify the telephone number and the time at which the   the officer may listen, or does it have anything to do with what   what   the content of the   of the conversation?
well, on   on that point   and i   i recognize it's   it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present   he did say   this is the prosecutor. the law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the   the conversion. so there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k)   under factor (k). but here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.
well, i   and maybe i misunderstood. was it   was it paying for it out of general taxes or taking this money and putting into the focus  
that's the   that's the question i asked mr. salmons  
there are a number of florida cases that involve open carports. how would you apply it there? somebody, if you had a carport that's not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a garden rake?
i believe, your honor  
justice breyer, if i could respond to that.
i sure do.
well, and justice kennedy, i think the point i would say is, in terms of gaining access to campus, we want to gain access at a level, and under circumstances, that perhaps some other employer would be excluded. well, once access is gained, then the question arose under the prior version of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what level of access suffices? and on that second-order question of what level of access suffices, then you look to what is provided to any other employer. and so, that's why, when i say that we don't ask for any predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a year, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address system or the e-mail system. we simply say, "once you let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others." and that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment that the military is competing for the same pool of students that the other employers are competing for.
how do you   how do you reconcile that with the heat sensor case then?
your honor, i think in fact it is undisputed in   in the   in these cases that if the payment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly rate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the entire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included in the   in the respondent's gross income and nothing about the contingent fee arrangements here should   should alter that result. the respondents

  testimony.
yes, but  
it   shortly after the smack in the face by the juvenile, your honor, the officer entered the home, and by his testimony, it abated right after he entered the home.
you would basically end up going to a federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for processes to be changed prospectively.
yes, justice stevens.
all right. then if your only problem is second habeas, there i'd agree with you. there's a big problem. but it says here the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized. now, i guess a person who's filed a habeas doesn't have a right until the supreme court has made the   the rule retroactive. and therefore, until the supreme court makes it retroactive, there was no right recognized for a second habeas person. and therefore, for that case it does begin to run when the supreme court says it's retroactive because prior to that he had no right  
just to be clear, it is your position that to get   you think everyone's entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or not.
can i   can i ask you   it goes back to the first point your opponent made. what is the purpose of granting the priority? it seems to me the purpose of the priority is to increase the likelihood that the wage claims will be paid. and if you   if you win, it won't affect it one way or another, as you acknowledge in your brief. but it seems to me the priority should serve the purpose of increasing the likelihood that the benefits would actually flow to the employee benefit plan.
what about   what about the reliance interest, though? i mean, hasn't a whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance on the dr. miles rule? and don't we need to be concerned about the disruption to that established practice?
i believe our, i believe our right to be
