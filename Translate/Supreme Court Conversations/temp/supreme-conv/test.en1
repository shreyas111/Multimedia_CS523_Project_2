but we  but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief. we've simply said whether equitable relief would normally be available. and now you're  you're trying to rewrite our cases to say that only certain types of equitable relief are  are available.
well, there's no colloquy requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of mitigation. and i think it would have been enough if the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my  if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be adequate. if a defendant chooses to make a claim that his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.
thank you, mr. chief justice. first of all, to respond to one of the questions that was asked, it's very important that it is equally consistent in the 1992 plan to effectuate or to prevent white flight that the plan itself was changed to subjugate african american kids to the worse performing schools. if you find that equally consistent, then you have a question of whether or not illegitimate notions of racial inferiority applied or racial politics applied 
the case  the cases are uniform, including decisions from this court, that a mail fraud case does not require the element of reliance. it doesn't exist in the statute. the  it's the same mail fraud statute that's a predicate act for  for rico under section 1961.
 claim.
no. they certainly have an incentive to do that under both the equal pay act, which everybody acknowledges puts the employer subject to liability for any present disparity based on any prior decision that can't be justified as based on some factor other than sex, and that incentive has been around for a very long time and respondents aren't able to show that that's been an unmanageable burden. but employers as a matter of basic agency law know from the very beginning whether or not they've been paying the plaintiff less because of her sex.
surely there will be some people who  who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty.
uh-huh.
but congress has consistently  well, and the repeal  the reason the repeal of the miller-tydings act seems particularly relevant is that it is indeed  it was an amendment to this statute that this court is being asked to interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning of this statute as it stands.
well, under oregon law, is it possible that some of the mother's testimony would be otherwise admissible at the penalty stage?

but it's high.
there's a lot of legislative history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, your honor, about efficiency and  and the convenience. but it's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies, about rights once there's a breach.
 an opportunity 
thank you, your honor. we agree with general gornstein's statement of the test. the test is a state cause of action that necessarily depends on a substantial question of federal law arises under for 1331 purposes. the difference between my argument and the argument of respondent is the meaning of substantial or what constitutes substantiality. and in merrell dow, the court held for all federal statutory purposes the federal law is not substantial enough to confer arising-under jurisdiction unless congress created a private remedy along with the statute. that's where we part company.
thank you, justice stevens. neither section 61(a) nor any other provision of the internal revenue code expressly requires that a federal civil rights litigant, such as mr. banks, include in his gross income the portion of a litigation recovery that was earned by, retained by, and already taxed to his attorney as a contingent fee. the commissioner's position in this case relies exclusively on the misapplication of a judicial doctrine known as the assignment of income doctrine. that doctrine originated and developed as a judicial anti-abuse rule, designed to prevent high-bracket taxpayers 
 the statute says it's a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.
do you agree that in that context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we  that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then supplement it with other, with other means of, other ways of showing obviousness?
but it's clearly a 2 to 1 majority in favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the government.
the term "micro color" describes  this is not my area of expertise, but  describes, as i understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent make-up process. and the reason it's called "micro color" 
 reason that the defendant couldn't introduce other evidence in his resentencing trial, is there?
well, we accept cert before we do that. i thought the question was that the denial of an application for appeal does not have any merits consequence. wasn't that the question?

justice o'connor, section 1519 was enacted after the events

well, do you say that a tribe can never lose its sovereign rights to land? can it acquiesce in the loss of those rights?
but then they couldn't file 
well, the plea proceeding. it's the plea proceeding. and it's 
 that period has how many months to run?
i'm sorry, your honor?
no, i do not believe that is incorrect. i'm sorry, your honor. what i do believe is correct is that under mississippi law, the jury, because of the bifurcated nature of the  of the case, is given at least the preliminary reference or preliminary instruction that if there is a guilt verdict, then there will be a sentencing phase. but we submit that that is a distinction that this court has not adopted, nor have other courts adopted because in this situation 
well, it doesn't happen in michigan because 
you would agree, in my hypothetical, there's discrimination, but you'd say there's no injury to competition.
in addition, the court's recent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction have all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of what does the text say. the  the issue of not conflating the use of the word jurisdiction, which has been referenced in a number of the court's opinions, steel company, kontrick, eberhart, scarborough, all point to the fact that where the text is clear, as it is in this case, and there is no ambiguity, then subject matter jurisdiction lies if a claim is brought under a federal act. if there's no further questions, i'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
encompasses a lien for a refund action in the case where you took the property via a lien. and you'd say  they say, i guess, but it doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. why not? because of the specific, the same thing i just said. now i want to be sure i have your whole answer to that.
yes, your honor.
well, we haven't challenged the conversations as such. we think it is  it is suspect, however. under raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, i don't agree or i think you may be wrong in your credibility determination, i'd like you to reconsider that, that's a serious raddatz problem. and the only cure for that is to make the first report part of the record.
 that in the decision. the phrase from the tort claims act about "as a private party" was repeated, but i don't remember any discussion of what that private party would be, in muniz.
well, the test, as the fifth circuit stated, justice stevens, is whether a judgment against dow  i'm quoting. quote: whether a judgment against dow would cause it to need to alter the strongarm label. i'm  and that's the  those are  that's the test that was applied here and is always applied.
was  was that the ship or was it longshoremen?
okay. but you say that when it gets to whether it's a  there's a  involving a covered security, for some reason that can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.
well, i think it derives in part from the sentencing reform act, which contemplated individualized sentencing.
well, i think that there is a possibility that he  he could qualify for a nonimmigrant visa at some point 
we have not found a case on that. however 
 that's not  that's not established. that's not established at all. his supervisor obviously thought he didn't 
well, your honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. we believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. but it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the first amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the first amendment.
because it  it is no  there is no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the aryan brotherhood and  and hispanic gangs and  and black gangs. there's no doubt that that exists. is it 
well, i was using it as a synonym for the "virtually per se unconstitutional" rule.
correct, your honor.
and i think that's why this test works. the third point would be that there be timeliness.
why  now, why should that not be binding on you if your allegations were, in fact, insufficient under penn central?
except if it's a will  will-specific. in other words, you  it seems to me you're in for a penny and in for a pound. you recognize the existence of this exception in certain cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well, congress wrote the statutes broadly. the latter argument disproves your first point.
 that's out of sync 
21a, correct. each provision of the indian self-determination and education assistance act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor. that statement is repeated as well in every 
yes, your honor.
because of the very practice that's being challenged here today, right?
and the best that i can do  the best that i can do, when i put together flast 
so in practice the answer is no?
well, schlup shouldn't  shouldn't have expressed it that way then. schlup must have  must have made a big mistake when it said no reasonable juror could. it should have expressed it differently and said a reasonable juror would not  would not have found, but they didn't say that. it said no reasonable juror.
 "substances act."
you don't contend the rule would be different if we were  if it was all prospective, do you?
why  why do you  are you sure that kyllo, you know, the  the imaging case, would have come out the same way if the only thing  the only thing  that the imaging could pick out is not any of the other private activities in the home, but the only thing it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife through the heart? are you sure the case would have come out the same way? i'm not at all sure.
well 
well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the attorney general's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal.
well, your honor 
well, justice kennedy, it's a difficult question to answer because i think there are a lot of different strains underlying the totten decision, and i think there is 
wasn't solitary confinement involved in sandin?
but the point  the point i was making is that it  it doesn't necessarily have to be the same rule that it is for a corporation, and  and that  that's what this court decided in the carden case.
but once you start from the premise that these are functional appeals, which they are, i don't see how you could read aedpa any other way. i mean, aedpa says that if there's an available method to challenge and  a petition, whether it be by review or original writ, to the california supreme court would be available. so, you could be sure that if prisoners 
 "reinforcing," and maybe it's "changing." i mean, you're characterizing it one way. we start with a different canon of meaning, and that is that we look to the words around which, in connection with which, the word is used. in here, it's being used without certain modifiers or descriptive conditions. in other cases, it is being used with them. and that's a good reason to think that probably the word is intended to mean something different in those situations.
then there would be a case with a controversy problem, i should think.
well, why would he be drawing it down, except to sell 
i don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.
 with one 
i think the most important point that i'm trying to make, justice souter and mr. chief justice, that when someone says, i do not want to give you my property, you have to take it from me and give me just compensation, the position of the government here is that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of retaliation they can engage in.
no. mr. chief justice, we don't think that the court should do that kind of nose counting based on whether a statute was enacted in 1800, 1850, 1900, 1950 and potentially have different rules for each statute. we think that the court should look at the entire 
well, thank you, justice souter. first, i'd point to the language that the judge provided, which was in regard to juror 16, the only one that is at issue, the court did not observe the demeanor. however, 16 was a youthful person, as was 6, and then prepared to give the district attorney the benefit of the doubt.
which is what is specifically precluded by the requirement that  that you act within 30 days, and  and all the rest of the time, the clock is running.
 and then renewed at the  at the end of all of the evidence?
 suppose that the attorney is  is waiting for payment of  of his, say, one-third contingent fee, and the client just absconds with the money. how is  what  what happens from a tax standpoint under your theory? i take it the attorney has to declare the income on his return and then declare a loss?
the rocks of crack cocaine, for which he was convicted, were found in his left front pants pocket.
well, it was not the applicable law at the time. the decision related back to before that hearing.
justice o'connor, the government's interest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope of what the statute at issue proscribes.
so it's carrier-based.
yes, your honor. i think the answer to that is in the statute. it's a  it's section  it's 21 united states code 355(i)(3)(b)(i). and in that 
mr. taranto?
and he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, so the money wasn't given to the government. so i don't see that that's a difference. and then the second case 
she's sitting down at  at a table, as i recall it, with the  with the police officer on the other side of the table.
you  you can make that argument, but it  it depends on, like you say, what  what do you mean when you ask that question. if you're going out to buy a ford car, then you obviously would want to know where it's located other than in michigan. you'd want to know where the nearest ford dealership is. located, obviously, can have several meanings, but that's one of the points, i think, that judge luttig made in his opinion, is you've got to look at it in the context in which it is said in the statute. and looking at the statute, in the context in which the word located is there, it says where  in  in the states where it's located. now, there are other places in the statute, which i'm sure they will argue or have argued in their brief, that  that say, you know, it's located, when they're talking about a bank  a branch bank where you can do insurance or whatever, that it can  it can sell insurance in any branch where  where it's located, and that means another meaning to locate. but you've got to look at locate in the context in which it's used, and 
i think that it  it fits the defense and that you can draw a distinction between excuse and justification, but i don't think the distinction ultimately matters whether you call it an excuse or justification. it's still the burden of proof should be on the defendant and it shouldn't  the nomenclature shouldn't matter.
no, because usually the court doesn't decide important  the construction of a federal statute, a federal criminal statute, without discussing it. it was  i don't want to say "buried in footnotes," but it was mentioned in the footnotes at the petition stage the second time around, and then it dropped out of the case. and even the united states didn't discuss it 
well, are there manuals  are there any  here is the cop on the beat.
all right. but what is actually worrying you, which probably you can address at some point, is this: there are remedies one by one. that's true. and each has one. and maybe you can even get injunctions against harassing.
it is indeed a different case, your honor. we do not 
the  the first one, obviously,  there's three. the first one is evidence control. the state has a pile of bills but no evidence about liability. now, beforehand, if they're involved, their  their interests and the beneficiary's are aligned to maximize recovery. after the fact, the state is going to go in, either at a post hoc hearing with the beneficiary or try to sue some third party, and the beneficiary is going to say, oh, i fell asleep at the wheel, i was on my cell phone, i had preexisting conditions, because her incentive is now to reduce your recovery. this is the exact opposite of the duty of cooperation that federal and state law envisioned for this process. the second 
and can they 
it's an agency policy and troopers with the washington state patrol are trained to it.
why isn't the obvious difference  i may have missed this  but you say, in the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the government via a lien took property from a different person who then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the lien and wanted it back. and in this case they did exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. so you say if the first could sue so could the second. but the difference, the obvious difference, which maybe you have explained and i missed, is that in the second case, namely this case, there is a specific statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine months, and in the other case there wasn't such a statute. why isn't that the obvious difference?
we do not, your honor. the fobian rule is wrong at least, especially as to the distinction that it draws between state law and federal litigation. there's only one answer to the question 
by analogy, you know that the period of time for seeking direct appeal is 60 days. so, it is  it's deciding something by analogy, in much the same way the federal courts do for a federal cause of action that has no statute of limitations.
can't it just say no signs when you're supposed to be learning?
i hate to say this, your honor, but it depends because at some point, for example, when the person is brought before the magistrate for the probable cause determination, they're not operating in a vacuum. there will have to be 
and you have a similar infirmity associated with the other methodology. that is, if you have a number of leas which are small in numbers, as in new mexico, particularly if you had a number of small leas at the bottom, which is i think a huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and let them to float off in their poverty. i think, i can understand where there is 
you're talking about geographical diversity 
 standard.
 do. they join in the consensus position of the united states. this brief has been coordinated not only with epa and ferc, but also the department of the interior and the army corps of engineers. this is the position of the united states.
 for thinking that it doesn't. and so, what's the special reason 
well, in that  you know, in  under those circumstances, it seems to me that the standard is slightly different for quid pro quo violations than they are for simply tangible employment actions.
thank you.
yes. and when i say it was not before that, i'm talking about on the date of the california supreme court's decision. at the time of the jury determination, this court only had  or that court only had lockett to make a determination as to whether the evidence could be  could be considered. and the court made the decision that he thought the  it could be considered, but then refused to make any adjustments once it became clear that both counsel were going to argue their respective positions on the law. the  the court earlier talked about other instructions as impacting upon the  the context of the case, and those were important considerations in boyde, especially the observation that the jury was to consider any other evidence presented at either time in the trial. but in the context of this case, your honor, it means nothing. as i've indicated, the jury was required to ignore any evidence it heard at either phase of the trial unless it fit within factors (a) through (k). if it didn't fit within there, even though they heard that evidence, they were instructed to ignore it. beyond that, they were also instructed that the  that they were to consider the arguments of counsel. now, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury that they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant evidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on counsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important. so the other instructions, when you put them all together, rather than putting in proper context what did occur in this case, in effect make it even harder for bill payton's position that the jury should consider factor (k) to be relevant.
how does 
 i think we can decide it on the basis that we know that when the distributor puts  delivers gas to the gas station, it's not instantly sold. i mean, even we know that.
yes, and i think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. for individuals 
but your honor, this court has emphasized that content and context matter enormously. and what i'm trying to do is to distinguish the situation where in texas, it was clearly tablets with the words, i am the lord, thy god, with five commandments for religious behavior and five for secular behavior. from justice souter's question, there are five others and especially those that are reflected in state law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal. i think that the message is different there. it is the words, i am the lord, thy god.
but 
no objections at all. there were no objections at all. in our case there were 12 objections, so clearly the defense attorney was on the mark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the prosecutor. of the eight comments that the eighth circuit found objectionable in this case, only three of them were objected to.
but you're saying the argument 11 could have been made at  at the time of this trial 
yeah. they had to pay these unlawful charges under securities laws, no matter where they went. and in terms of the inextricably intertwined, it is the qualitative difference that stops that. i think behind the solicitor general and the sec's proposal is a fear that the syndicates, the underwriters are vulnerable to an antitrust case because they operate together. that's not true. there's never been a case precisely like this; and the underwriters as brokers, as market makers, they operate together and cooperatively all the time. five years goes by. seven years goes by. there's no antitrust case 
yes.
 the question 
and there is nothing express in the statute suggesting that it's designed to put in the hands of the federal government or the attorney general the regulation of the practice of medicine, is there?
your honor, because that  again, that was what congress was trying to clarify in 2004. and if you look at the dibuo case and the lesesne case cited on page 27 of the sg's brief, both those cases make clear that notwithstanding procedural violations, there must actually be a causation, there must actually be substantive harm before any relief can flow from that.
well, if we're talking about complicated financial crimes, that's not unusual.
and 
there isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.
that's correct, and this court handled that in wilander, your honor, that it said in 
yes, the entire penalty evidence and all argument and the instructions is in there. and that's  unless the court has any additional questions, i have nothing further. thank you.
yes.
 original 
well, there  as i say, the court  the court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.
well, you 
take justice alito's case, and nobody litigated it because nobody doubted that it was a loaded gun. now, what's the result?
ms. mahoney, you argue, in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis of equitable considerations under the declaratory judgment act. we can't reach that argument unless we rule against you on the article iii question. is that right?
absolutely not.
like the says that was argued, the first case this morning?
well, actually the district court established that this was not on the record at the time of the plea. the district court took evidence on this issue. the statutes to  that are underlying these convictions, to get back to justice scalia's question, are nongeneric, and they are nongeneric in the sense that they make it unlawful to break into structures other than buildings or in addition to buildings.
that is correct. and, again, the district court could be called upon to address that question, as appears to be the case here, and the district court would endeavor to apply the rules of the grievance proceeding to the facts regarding exhaustion. if, in the event the grievance proceeding didn't, for instance, sufficiently put the inmate on notice, didn't provide clarity on whether or not  on what he had to do under circumstances where there's a continuing consequence to a decision, perhaps in that instance it would be appropriate for the district court to decide, yes, indeed, he had exhausted, given the ambiguity on that point in the regulations.
 they're addressed  is it  they're addressed under state and federal whistle-blower laws, or 
your honor, they are both benefits. i would point your honor back to this court's decision in gratz, where the same analysis would apply. and if your honor's analysis is correct, that would mean, i think, that the gratz case would have been decided differently.
well, that's 
there would have to be at least two, and there would  it would have to go on to meet the court's pattern requirement. two generally is held not to be enough if it's a closed period of time that's over. but this complaint alleges an open period, and two would be enough, coupled with the allegation that this is the normal way for the company to conduct its business.
the seventh circuit went out of its way to say it was not finally resolving the question. but, justice scalia, it, again and again, went through our arguments and rejected them. and then, at the end of its opinion, it said it would be better to read the statute at  take the statute at face value, and that, it suggested, was what respondent's position was. so, i think it went as far as it possibly could to resolve the question and reject all of the arguments that are being made here. so, i think it  to go back to the district court, it would be a foregone conclusion, and it would just result in further delay. this case has gone on for almost 
so it just doesn't happen very often to begin with.
and even if he said, i hereby waive?
no. our  our view is that, i mean, like anytime the waiver or estoppel is at issue, one could say that that's being read into the statute, but the point, as this court has explained in hillen and  and mezzanatto, is that those are background principles of law that presumptively apply. our view is this: a court should make the finding, but a  a defendant may not challenge the finding if a few conditions are satisfied. first, the defendant was the one requesting the continuance and benefiting from it. second, the finding could have been made on the record in the case, and third, the defendant is responsible in some way for inducing the court not to make the finding. it could be by a waiver or it could be the defendant's  or it could be the court saying, i've decided it's appropriate to make an ends of justice finding. now, let me record this in the record, and defense counsel saying, your honor, please don't bother. it's late. we've got four more things to do. we don't need the findings. in that circumstance as well, it's not a waiver, but defense counsel would have  the defendant at that point should not be heard to complain about the absence of a finding that should ultimately 
but that  it could be remanded sua sponte for any number of reasons, so  so, you're saying not that there is some wiggle room to allow "may" to operate, you're simply saying it depends on the party that initiates the remand. and i guess my question is, could you give us an example, or examples, of a remand on a party's motion, on a plaintiff's motion, in which the fees would not be allowed?
no. i'm talking about just mississippi law. you're the prosecutor saying, we  we may not get robbery here. the  is that the only thing they charge is robbery or let the man go after he shoots and kills the person he doesn't even know?
it is, indeed, your honor. we acknowledge that, although, again, as i say, in some of the lower court cases there have been challenges where the claim that the plaintiffs did not have standing with regard to was challenging a different outcome in the same transaction or occurrence. the specific example was a challenge to an environmental impact statement, where the plaintiffs had standing to challenge certain elements, but did not have standing to challenge the potential  the failure of this impact statement to consider impacts on indigenous tribes. and the district  the district of columbia circuit held that they did have standing, based on their other standing claims, to reach that claim, as well. if i can turn, your honors, to the merits, if ohio were to impose an income tax on those corporations which did their manufacturing outside of the state of ohio, but not to impose that tax on those businesses which did their manufacturing inside of ohio, there's no question that such attacks would violate the commerce clause by facially discriminating in favor of in-state business activity. it would be a tariff, by any other name.
but this is  it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. and so it's  then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted  the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a  a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title ix sex discrimination complaint.
i mean  i mean 
 without regard to whether they're running for election or not.
i  i take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the united states as a necessary party defendant, that suit  any  that would be a suit pursuant to this section. i  i don't know what other meaning that  that sentence could have. when you sue two parties, one of whom is the united states, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and it can be brought in any united states district court in the state in which the land involved is situated. i  i don't know what  what other suit that  that sentence could refer to.
so you can have these banks  i don't know  presumably a state that they bear little or no relation to could offer some favorable treatment of them and they could suddenly say, you know, wachovia's main office is in wyoming or something, even though it doesn't  it has one  it has one atm or one branch there. and that would be all right with you? that would be where  where they were located?
if i may reserve the balance of my time.
yes.
i think that you could look to your area of administrative deference, for example, under chevron, where you do also defer to the authority of an agency, the interpretation of an agency. the determination of its own authority the court has upheld. thank you, your honor.
yes, but it's very hard to compare those two sales, because they all depend upon the special features on the trucks that are ordered by the particular individual, and also how  you know, how much of a hard bargain that individual is driving. i don't know how you can compare a sale to one  one person with xyz features on the truck with a sale to a totally different person with abc features on the truck.
 could we go back 
right, but that's the heck 
they do indeed, your honor. those surveys were surveys by the university of kentucky research center of parents.
well, we believe that  that it is the same. and in fact, the  the case that the state cites, state v. goodin, explains that. the representation of goodin in the state's brief, as it appears in the respondent's brief at page 23, we contend is not faithfully representative of what the court said in that case.
well, they didn't have to take it as true. as i understand it, when they went back before the  the two original judges on the motion to vacate, they didn't have to take the  the testimony about the jailhouse admission as true, and they didn't have to take the state's position at the wesley trial as true. it was evidence. it was before them. they were in  they were required to consider it. but as i understand it, the state at that point essentially was  was agnostic. the state said, you know, this is what happened, this is what we said, this is what the jury did in the second trial, but regardless of how you determine  of  of any determination about triggerman, this man stumpf still deserves death, so don't vacate the sentence. and  and there was nothing i guess  number one, there doesn't seem to be at that point a  a problem with the state taking inconsistent positions, i.e., with its position in  in the  in the wesley case, and there doesn't seem to be any  any lack of candor. there may be a  a lack of initiative on the state's part to fish or cut bait, but there's no lack of candor. so where does the due process violation come at that point?
that's correct, and i think that it is unreasonable. i think the state court in this case had essentially two lines of authority, that it was trying to decide which one controlled this case. it had penry which involved evidence of mental impairment and child abuse, and it had johnson and graham which involved evidence of youth and other background. and i think that the facts of these cases, given the facts of these two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say they fit over here with johnson and graham rather than they fit over here with penry. and that's why i think the decisions by the state courts are not just wrong, but objectively unreasonable. if the court has no further questions, i will reserve the remainder of my time.
i mean, it's not beyond the pale to consider this testimony.
well, it seems to me that you might  you might have alleged that  that you've read articles, lancet articles, and so forth, and that there is a substantial risk that they're going to do this. i think that might suffice.
i see.
well, they may not have to 
it could have, your honor, but i don't know why it did not except for the fact that it could have been built into the curtilage 
counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the supreme court of oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed. the supreme court of oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?
your honor, it is an assessment of all the circumstances, that if you're a trial judge 
 which is why my answer was as to the common area. certainly they can get a warrant that says we know that there's an item that represents evidence of a crime and that it's going to be at a particular location upon delivery and we can go in and search that location.
 yes.
general clement 
how would you do that? how would you do that forfeiture?
no, i mean 
oh, i'm not focusing.
 the context in which this law developed. it developed, originally  if you were a public employee, you did not have free-speech rights as a citizen. as justice holmes said, you know, you might have the right to speak, but you don't have the right to be a policeman. so, the "as a citizen" part didn't come out of happenstance.
that's correct.
can the student be allowed to wear a button that says "rape is fun"?
well, i think, justice breyer, it depends on how the fraud plays out, and  and i would acknowledge that this is a  a somewhat nebulous area when you 
but why is that? i mean, we spend a lot of time with these old english cases. why  why did congress  it seems an arbitrary line.
well, your honor, in day versus mcdonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas statute of limitations, this court approved the court of appeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they  although in that case the court 
they  that's not their allegation, though, in this sense. the theory that your hypothesis is postulating is a money laundering predicate act, but they don't assert money laundering as the predicate act. they assert fraud. and it's exactly the same conduct, the alleged underpayment of taxes that is fraudulently sent to the state of new york, and through that, an indirect injury. so their theory under (a) and under (c) of section 1962 factually is exactly the same. the only reason that they brought in an (a) claim is, as i pointed out, to get at the pocket with suing national as a corporate defendant. but i would point out here, in further answer to your question, justice ginsburg, the state of new york, under the holmes test, is the proper plaintiff for purposes of vindicating the law's purposes, which after all, is to negate the activity of fraud.
in a case of  of 
we 
 taylor were not on the books. what  what would be the basis of your argument? you say that it's all right to look at a plea colloquy, but it's not all right to look at an arrest report to which the judge referred. what's the basis for that distinction? what sense does it make?
but i'm suggesting to you that it often happens that there are false charges made that the  that the police believe to be true.
yes.
i'm  yes, but you're talking technically.
so, then what you're saying, it 
yes.
that is right, although we have  we would win the case on the internal waters and the territorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this court a claim relating to the high seas. if i could reserve the remainder of my time.
and you need an objection or else it's, it will be okay?
thank you, mr. chief justice. the respondent came to this court saying that he agrees with mr. medellin that america could keep her  should keep her word. here's the situation we have. everybody agrees that these treaties are binding. everybody agrees now that the president has determined that mr. medellin should get exactly what he came to this court asking for, which is review and reconsideration from the state courts. the  as mr. dreeben has pointed out, and as we advised the court last week, in order to protect against any statute of limitations bar, we have, in fact, filed in texas, in order to make these claims, pending the disposition here. and mr. medellin is prepared to go forward in state court, making exactly these claims, which the state courts have never had an opportunity to occasion. the question here is, how does this court fulfill its function of ensuring that the united states complies with its international obligations that the president has now confirmed he will comply with? and, of course, the question here is not whether this  whatever this court does with respect to the question presented here  that is, does the avena judgement having binding effect under the supremacy clause?  in this case, would no in any way constrain the president's determination at some future point, because here we have a situation where the president has said "comply." and so, this case does not raise questions  if it operated directly under the supremacy clause  does not raise a question about what would happen if, in some future case, the political branches made a different determination once an icj judgement came to this country. here, we have the president saying, "you should do exactly what  the united states  what the icj said to do." so the question is, how does one proceed? we have proposed a means of going forward that, in our view, is respectful to the authority of this court, that is respectful to the texas courts, and that's respectful to the president; and that is, to go forward on the subsequent application in the texas courts, giving them two issues that they've never had a chance to address, the avena judgement claim and the claim under the president's determination. what should not happen is, that application should not be compromised by any adverse action on this court, and the suggestion of a dismissal might have compromising effects. at a minimum, it might be perceived as leaving in place a judgement that this court has already said warranted review and is now, in our view, fatally undermined by the president's determination, as it has been previously fatally undermined by the plain command of the supremacy clause. in addition, we would, no doubt  we're already hearing arguments from the opposition to the motion to stay  we would no doubt hear arguments that, on some subsequence habeas which the united states says is  would be available, that that would be a second or successor habeas, even though mr. medellin has never had a chance to bring the  otherwise, to bring these claims to the court. and, therefore, the court might, at some point  at this point, the best thing to do, if we are going to achieve expeditious compliance with the president's determination  is, in fact, to stay; not to deal with any of the questions that have been raised here, but to let the texas courts deal with them in the first instance. if it comes back to this court in the posture of a direct  for example, request for certiorari review from a judgement of the texas courts  there should be no adverse impact from anything this court did at this posture, simply because mr. medellin came here. and, indeed, it was mr. medellin's case that presumably prompted the president to act. that would be unfair, and it would complicated the court's own disposition. what do we have texas saying before this court? effectively, texas has come into this courtroom and said neither the president nor this court can effect  can give effect of the avena judgement, because texas has opposed the court's authority under the direct operation of the supremacy clause, and now texas has told the court that the president can't do this either. and in the face of that suggestion, mr. medellin has every hope and expectation that the texas courts will see their obligations under the supremacy clause in a form of both the avena judgement interpreting and applying the vienna convention and the president's determination, differently than the texas authorities have so far announced. but if it does not, this court should have the full complement of means at its disposal in order to ensure that the united states complies with its international obligations. mr. dreeben has, himself, just suggested that there may be circumstances if it were not otherwise achievable. it's hard to think of a more important case for the exercise of this court's extraordinary writs. but none of that should be in any way compromised by a dismissal, at this point, simply because the president came in in the midst  in fact, concurrently  into mr. medellin's own case before this court and made this determination. instead, as we'd suggest, the appropriate thing would be  to do is to stay the case, to allow it to go forward in the texas courts. but if the court does not wish to stay, we would respectfully suggest that, at this point, under direct command of the supremacy clause endorsed by the president's determination, as well as the president's determination itself, the court should give effect to the united states' promises. thank you very much.
well, i'm  i  i don't think so because on the next page she continues discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10.
then let 
the court 
 in our brief we suggest it might not 
i would respectfully say to your honor that it's not an automatic stay. i mean, perhaps there would be a stay at some point. but there are things that can be accomplished in federal court before the undertaking of the review. there is the rule 4 screening process in habeas. there is the initial review by the district court to see if the filing itself meets the procedural requirements. there is the asking for an answer by the state. there is discovery that can take place. all of this can take place while the cert petition is pending before the federal district undertakes any review of the merits. now, if there gets to be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is going to be a conflict between the federal district's court's review of the substantive merits and that is going to conflict with this court's certiorari review, well, then i think a stay would be implemented.
that's correct, mr. chief justice, which is the reason 
that is correct, justice souter. in the case of the shoshone-paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.
the district court can refuse to issue a stay and abeyance order. it can put tight deadlines on a stay and abeyance order. the district court can revoke a stay and abeyance order. it can alter it if there is delay. i believe that is a decision that should be left to the court that's closest to the facts, the district court.
may i just clarify one other thing? capacity to fire doesn't mean it had to be loaded, though.
right. and  and 
no, i'm talking about the only remedy available after the motion has been reserved, after 
 the way it structured 
but that is not our case, is it? because our case is not, "we don't find that the mitigators outweigh." our case is, "we find the mitigators are of equal weight." that's why you get to equipoise. it's not a question of the failure of mitigators to predominate.
now, that was enacted, was it not, in 1887?
and  and does it on a pervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis.
if he wants, if he wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the ninth circuit, right? because the ninth circuit held that he didn't waive 
you either cough it up or you lose.
yeah, that's what i'm trying  i'm trying to get to, which is, what is actually the practical thing to do now? should we stay it, with a short per curiam, which says, "texas, go ahead," or should we do something else? suppose we just dismiss this, as you say, on the alternative ground. well, then what happens if texas objects to the president's order and turns out to be right, legally? see, if that were true and then the review showed that it was true  - i don't know that it is true, but if it were, then we should turn to the fifth circuit claim, and there are 51 cases that depend on it. but if we've dismissed it, by that time it's gotten mixed up in the very issue you raise. the question is, does "constitutional" embrace "treaty"? and i think there is one case that says it does, actually; or a treatise, anyway. so that's an issue. and then they might refuse a coa on that ground. and then there might  and we'll never get this basic question decided. i'm trying out on you the argument for actually staying it, rather than digging it.
so that even if the intent was primarily political, it would still violate section 2.
yes, or sabic brings a motion 
why? he went through the entire guilt phase with the more moderate restraints, just the leg brace, and there was no incident. there was no disturbance in that trial. he didn't try to lash out at anyone. why wasn't that the best example of what one could anticipate in the penalty phase?
yes.
no, there isn't, justice ginsburg, but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it applies to efforts by the united states government to secure punishment by  for a criminal conviction. but, justice ginsburg, if the court were to disagree with that and were to believe that restitution, even when it's been sought by the united states  not by a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to instigate a lawsuit  but that even when the united states does it, that somehow falls within the parameters of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that problem would be to interpret the restitution statute against the background of the revenue rule, not to interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the united states is wholly barred. the petitioner's submission here is really rather extraordinary 
i see  i see that. that's a good answer. and the  the question i have is if i now, since we have real indigents, believe that there absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus brief. suppose i believed that, and i do believe it actually. if i believe it, then does your third party standing claim disappear?
i'm laughing at the statute, not at you.
it is our position that in 1998 when 17 the state courts ruled, it was entirely reasonable for the 18 supreme court to view simmons as requiring that issues of 19 future dangerousness be generated by the prosecution's 20 argument.
either one.
and the same thing in the bar case. the  the restriction against the sale of  of liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking to raise the third party right. but here, there's no restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking to raise the third party right.
and you say that if that's the case, you can file a  a state  a state claim that is plainly no good and until the state court finally gets around to  to telling you that it's no good, your  your aedpa claim is tolled.
well, the case has settled, justice ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of trial procedures, and so 
lane and hibbs. tennessee against lane and nevada against hibbs. i can't imagine after those decisions that somebody 
wouldn't it at least be theoretically possible to differentiate between setting aside a preference, on the one hand, and just bringing a suit for a tort or a breach of contact, on the other? one could treat the assets that are  were transferred prematurely  or hastily, whatever you call it  as part of the estate. at least it's conceptually possible.
well 
they're  they're moved when their behavior improves. the average over a long period of time has been in the range of a year or so.
i'm borrowing the language from the midland asphalt opinion, but i think that it was a poetic way of putting the point that if you don't have 
the government wouldn't  wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case. it would just have to prove hate.
yes. and the land, when the oneida's possession of the land, actual possession is unified with their underlying federal property and treaty rights, the land is inalienable and cannot be sold today out of the oneida's possession any more than it could 200 years ago.
i think i probably would have argued in the alternative, your honor. i think that's probably the safest 
 is that they can find this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive selling market.
there is an offset. i 
well 
first of all, that  if the  if the exception, as i understand it, is that of harms to or from the content of the mail, that isn't going to 
may i ask you this question? excluding capital cases, in your view  anecdotally, if it has to be that  what percentage of cases that go to juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated proceedings for sentencing purposes? 10 percent?
well, it contains a time and a place. it's quite specific that there was an accident and that defendant, defendant of a certain name at a certain time and place negligently drove. what it doesn't tell you is the details of the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is specific in time and place and person, which is one of the  one of the concerns, i mean, if you strip away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to use a discovery process to find out whether or not that's true. isn't that essentially what this complaint is?
what do you mean 
exactly.
now, am i 
 wrong in that?
why should we  if i can get back to one of the factors. why should we draw a distinction between the  the sole inventor who needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery and  and somebody else? why  why should he lose the leverage of the normal injunction and have substituted for that a duel of experts over what a reasonable royalty should be?
the problem with that is  certainly, it would solve things, but the problem with that is, it would require the  require the california courts to make both of those determinations in every case. and, as it is now, they use a procedure much like 
general clement, can you be affirmative now? because we have an example, from justice stevens, which is the yale example. the  it was the main campus, instead of the law school. what  - the recruiter is there. he's in the same room that other recruiters use. what can the law faculty do to disassociate itself from  to say that, "we don't tolerate discrimination of any kind"? what can the law school do, concretely, while the recruiter is in the room?
by mistake. but i would not assume a mistake unless it's very clear.
yes.
well, it 
because i don't believe that's a public forum.
okay. she said, "i think you should go in there and get it."
the  they're focusing on the pool. petitioners and the government have cited a number of economists who talk about price discrimination in the abstract. we're not talking here about senior citizen discounts at the movies. we're talking about price discrimination with respect to a tying market, in which, by the way, the dangers of shrouding information to the consumer are demonstrated by this case. the  the petitioners 
and  and the measure of compensation would be? how would the state  let's take a  an ordinary rental property, and the city puts a rent control ordinance into effect. you say that's a taking, and how would one measure the compensation?
but then, at the hearing, who  who introduces the first exhibit or the first witness?
 to run effective campaigns.
that is  yes, your honor, that is 
fine. now the question is, why doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection system put a different kind of thing, a sorting system or a system designed to maintain a degree of integration, why doesn't that difference make a difference?
well, if there were more, if there were other people who had causes of action, then i think there is a problem. in your hypothesis if only one person is injured 
before you go back, let's hear official about the accounting rules. what would they be issued under? would they be issued under 201?
may i ask this question, just to get it in the  supposing volvo had a policy of granting everybody a 20 percent concession, and they had  except reeder  and they always granted reeder just a 15 percent concession, and the  you had the same sales pattern you have here. would there be a violation of the robinson-patman act?
mr. utrecht, if i understand the respondents' brief correctly, there is on pages 10 and 11 a whole list of issues that they say were determined  raised, litigated, and determined in the state court. so, for example, that the hco's housing replacement fees bear a reasonable relationship to loss of housing, the use of a defined historical measure  measurement point reasonably related to the hco's  and it goes on for a paragraph, citing issues that respondents say  says were raised, litigated, and decided in the california supreme court.
well, justice breyer, i, i would respectfully like to go back, not to what we are trying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what congress accomplished through its decision.
it may be a defense. i'm not quite certain how agency law principles apply in that circumstance when there's been a change of ownership. but certainly when there hasn't been it's not unfair to the employer to say that so long as you base present pay on long past decisions it's your responsibility to make sure that that present pay is not discriminatory.
but why in light of 4(a)(1)?
in this case, it's invalid as to both, because it serves both purposes. it's  first, sees it as an eligibility factor, and then the  the provision says  it doesn't say just consider special circumstances in some vague, undefined way; it specifically refers the jury back to its findings at the guilt phase. section 190.3, subsection (a), says, "consider the existence of an  any special circumstances found true at the guilt phase." that's telling the jury, "your  the findings that made the defendant get the death penalty" 
no. no, but let's get behind the rhetoric. is there any reason my hypothetical could not, in fact, turn out to be true?
yes, but you don't go up on appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment rule, as there is in the federal system, from the denial or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.
i'm sorry, i didn't hear the last part of your question.
i  i guess i  i would just think it's unlikely because although this statute has some drafting  it certainly raises some drafting issues, i think they likely  that basic element of this court's retroactivity jurisprudence, which has been true for decades, i think likely 
thank you, your honor. first of all, the default rule, that rule being that unless the state is invited into the negotiations, that liability  the extent of the liability of the third party can be considered to be 100  the full amount that medicaid had to pay  that is a very important rule. and it makes sense because money that has to be spent  there was a suggestion of post-settlement hearings to determine what portion of the money is for  for medical costs and what is for something else. such hearings would be incredibly expensive, horribly inconvenient. the state would have to, you know, burden  shoulder this burden, and this is money that could be going into the medicaid program. every dollar that's recovered from liable third parties is put back into the medicaid program, and if the state has to keep hiring more lawyers and has to have administrative hearings or proceeding in judiciary proceedings to determine what part of a settlement constitutes a payment, then that  that is just a very inefficient use of  of very limited federal  or state funds. i heard a comment in mr. blair's argument that arkansas law  i think it was 
and your claim as i take it, that there is an infringement with the union's right of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme restricts the union's use of its own funds?
well, first of all, justice souter, motions like this are typically made long in advance of trial, as this one was. waiting until the day of trial is far from the optimum practice.
right. and  and  but he's not necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.
we would say that's fine. we would say that that is permissible, for the school to pursue that. just to get back, though, again, we say that that avoiding racial isolation is  i just want to make the point, we say that racial isolation is an important government interest. i think if you put this plan up against that objective, it solely fails, because there are two high schools that i think you would look at as being racially isolated. they're cleveland n rainier beach, and this plan does nothing to directly address those high schools.
what  what about a religion that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation i want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my race?
justice scalia, what it does is, it allows the jury to know that just because something hasn't been re-presented to them in the penalty phase, but came in, in the guilt phase, it's open for their consideration.
yes, your honor. i'm not here to refight the battle of boyde. you know, i spilled tons of hours of time and printer's ink in an amicus brief in 1989, and i understand the concept of "you lose." what we are arguing is that the boyde test should be applied to the circumstances of this case, and that factor (k), standing alone, in a  in a case where defendant relies on skipper evidence, does not warrant relief by that fact alone. here we have much more than that fact which, under boyde, does call for relief. i would like to give 
no, no, but the question is suppose we have a different case, not this case. everything is the same but for the fact we know for sure it wasn't a robbery. that's all. now, in that different case, is it a crime under the law of mississippi what happened?
mr. ayer, let  maybe i'm going to oversimplify to the point of the absurd but let me try it. the argument that you're answering is the argument that there is no textual basis in (a) to distinguish the geographical diversity requirement from the amount-in-controversy requirement. your answer is, i think, that when the drafters in (a) refer to action and jurisdiction, those terms have to be understood historically as we have understood them, and the significance of a  a geographical problem, which does destroy jurisdiction traditionally, is different from an amount-in-controversy problem which is  which does not and is dealt with more simply. is that your 
it does seem as if the argument, that, "oh, this all comes in under second  under the second prong," means that if there's a  there's another inference. it's a  it's a secondhand argument about lack of mens rea.
why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim? as i understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case. you showed that you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the men are getting much higher. but the employer has come forward with any other factor other than sex and the other factor is that, your inadequate performance.
section 3731(c) does not require, in its application, the court to construe a civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other than what its words import because it only relates to the united states' burden of proof. the petitioner suggested that it implicitly was limited to an action under 3730(a). well, that's certainly not true because if  if an action is brought under 3730(b) and the united states intervenes, section 3731(c) establishes the standard of proof. if congress were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the united states to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms, establish the burden of proof that the united states would have to meet. so there is no inconsistency there.
yes, there would be. and there would be  their argument about the missouri pacific case is wrong because what the  what was going on there was the remand determination, not the underlying federal right. and that's what would be appealed, and there would also be appeal of the preclusive consequences because that would be a question of federal law under this court's longstanding determination. the restatement 
well, congress could have  could have said  could have thought not only do we not want people who  who file complaints not to suffer those things that would deter a reasonable person from filing a complaint, but we just don't want them to suffer at all for having engaged in this protected activity.
but they can't remove the action unless it could have been there in the first place.
well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that state court suit. there wouldn't be any recovery from which you could claim reimbursement were it not for that state court lawsuit.
we would believe that, in fact, in this case, i don't even think they thought about whether there were different versions but we certainly believe that they could have the text there and talk about the ten commandments.
no, i don't think so. i think in the  i don't think so. the court could apply just straightforward "law of the case" principles and say, "regardless of whether we actually reached the four predicate acts, our judgment spoke clearly that the injunction had to be vacated."
with respect, justice souter, i think they were 
well, the point, justice souter, is that they have to make a judgment that criminal conversations are what is going to be intercepted.
right, and 
it's not romano. romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?
well, if we disagree and think it should be, i guess that would open a door down the road for people after this court made such a determination.
she  she clearly didn't forget. the prosecutor said to her the evidence was testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it was a .32 
well, the  the court of appeals here said what it would  it read in a check. it said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction. it had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair. wasn't that what the court of appeals said?
i'm surprised that that's the  i would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support. was there no first amendment interest.
do you think the defendant can subpoena the prosecutor?
your honor, that question has been posed by some of the amici and it is a good question, but not the question before you.
well, it's certainly relevant to bill payton, and  and i don't demean the position of the court. it's not relevant in terms of its impact as to future cases. there are some cases left that are still dealing  out there, dealing with factor (k). the best our knowledge, we've  we've done a search and we believe there is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned factor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from  and we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've reviewed, none of them deal both with payton's pure post-crime evidence, coupled with the prosecutor's unrelenting position to the government that they cannot consider that evidence.
absolutely, your honor. but it was also before the 1974 amendment. so if the question is, what was congress intending in creating two types of rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit, and the general rulemaking authority, i think we need to consider congress's intent at that time.
it wouldn't be bad that's what  well, yes. in this case it's very bad because it's a search. there's no question. i'm not coming off of that.
that's  that's true, your honor, but it is available to the court as an alternate ground of affirmance of  of the decision below.
ordinarily i would agree with that. and if we knew, your honor, that he was speaking about these killings, then certainly it would go to the weight. but since he was speaking about killings that she said she didn't know if they were in california, new jersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and therefore  in california we ask that before you present third party culpability evidence you tie it to this crime.
but suppose we 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: title ii of the americans with disabilities act validly abrogates the states' sovereign immunities as applied to the class of cases involving the unconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates. that result follows from this court's decisions in nevada against hibbs, and tennessee against lane. in lane, this court held that it was clear, beyond peradventure, that congress had an adequate basis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that individuals with disabilities had access to public services. in reaching that conclusion, this court surveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to the court-access context, and, indeed, surveyed evidence involving prisons, in particular. as a result, the sole remaining question, and the only question in lane on which this court applied an as-applied analysis, is the question of whether or not title ii's remedies are congruent and proportional as applied to the particular context; here, the context of the discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise unconstitutional treatment of inmates with disabilities. now, if one applies the congruence and proportionality analysis of lane, in particular, in the prison context, it easily passes constitutional muster. for all of the factors that this court emphasized as making title ii appropriate in the court-access context  the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent flexibility of the reasonable modification standard, the fact that benefits are limited to otherwise eligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental alterations or undue burdens  all of those factors apply with full force in this context.
well, it's not very different from when the federal courts adopt a state statute of limitations 
we believe that  that there are, in effect, two forms of simple murder because of the structure of  and in fact, the mississippi supreme court has said this  because of the structure of the mississippi murder definitions. they are contained in a number of separate sections, but the most important of which is that a killing, not done in certain enumerated felonies, such as robbery or attempt to rob, would constitute simple murder. we believe that the simple murder instruction would have been correct. but even if it were not, we would respectfully submit that that is sufficient to raise the question.
and under your view of the facts, as i understand it, he would have been entitled to a manslaughter instruction.
 mr. hill, where it wouldn't give rise to another 1983 action?
if that's yes, then the category here is election speech. if you're going to call a statute that treats election speech especially, then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in that category. and if you're going to use that distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation. and courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny to campaign finance regulation because there are speech interests on both sides of the equation.
yes, the patent  well, no. i mean, not necessarily. their view is that, because of the terms of the agreement, that the patent holder has no choice but to  because they're receiving the royalties, to simply 
and that takes you back to what the district court ruled in zahn and  and, in effect, what this court affirmed in zahn, which is that there's a fundamental difference between sort of finding a single, individual plaintiff and saying, you know, this person, if you could just excise that claim, drop it under rule  that person under rule 21, that fixes it. there's a fundamental difference. i mean, the question here is what's the civil action because there are res judicata, collateral estoppel 
 and wright and miller confirmed this, that actually courts have tried to develop different tests: is it the same evidence that they're going to use? is it a core of operative facts? and, in the end, they say there's no better test than the one set forth in the rule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence.
but the whole point  at least i understand  of justice breyer's question is that you have taken a step to make it more difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously more likely than not he's not going to be there. and if you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, i think more likely he would have gotten it.
and i thought that, at least, would be open on remand.
well, your honor, the perils of the sea, which this court discussed at length in the papai case, we  we say that  that is further evidence that mr. stewart is not entitled to jones act remedies. mr. stewart was on a construction site. it happened to be a work platform in site of land. he was never more than 500 yards off the coast. the dangers that he was up against were more akin to that of a construction worker or, at the very least, a harbor worker or a stevedore. they were not the same perils that are normally faced by a true seaman. now 
in the afternoon he was.
the contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram. and the appropriations 
is there  may i interrupt you? because your time is getting short. is there a difference between a presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and a rule that says the further you get from them, you can get as far as you want to, but the further you get from them, the more extensive your explanation has to be? is there a distinction between those two, two rules?
it would be because of the anti-lien provision. but because she assigned her right to payment for medical care, that  the anti-lien provision doesn't operate with regard to that amount of money that is recovered from a third party in a  in a third party settlement. if there are no further questions, i'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
and that's  that's a special use of the term prima facie. now, if  if we want to be consistent with the use of the word  of the term, prima facie, from batson to title vii, then it seems to me this inquiry is necessary. but  and you're the one that puts it in motion by setting this rather high threshold that is the same as to go to a jury. i disagree with that.
which is 
well, i think that happens. that is, as soon as the prosecutor is asked to defend her challenge, she does, and she talks about youthfulness. she says the young person doesn't have ties in the community, doesn't have a stake in the community, is unmarried, perhaps has a greater tolerance for drug crime with a small amount. this is a three-strikes case. it would be a natural worry, i think, for a district attorney to think that a third strike, even though one and two were armed robbery and rape  that a third strike that's a possession of a small amount of drugs, you might need to worry about a juror's tolerance or worrying about that severity of sentence.
even though it's going to bilk people out of millions of dollars?
did he 
but does  does 
i  i think that is  i think that is where we  where we are. we have a policy that was not placed in the record by the applicant for this priority. we have our general knowledge of what workers' comp insurance policies are. we have a statutory requirement which reads, a calculation with 180 days, which i suggest is an anomaly when we compare it to the statutory language.
may i 
i'm not sure, your honor. i don't know.
understand, you keep asking, quite properly obviously, how does strong inference change anything? the test we have proposed and the test i believe the seventh circuit applied is not the classic 12(b)(6) have you stated a claim, because we all know at least traditionally, under notice pleading, you can march through that. this test, if you follow that time line backward, is in effect asking that district judge to make a decision on looking at the totality of this complaint, is this case trial worthy? it's a curious thing. i don't envy district judges who have to do this. is it trial worthy? why would congress say, if a district judge is willing to say under the classic test, i think it's trial worthy, there's no reason to believe that congress wanted to cut that case off.
that's equitable in your view? what?
that was not the situation in this case, your honor.
no, your honor, because 
well, there would have been a need to under your view now.
they specifically did not transfer 
i can't  i 
or activities. but, again, justice souter, all that suggests is that there are times when somebody who's working in a clothing operation may  you know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may spend time actually sewing the cloth. those are two separate activities. they're different activities. but it doesn't mean  and it certainly doesn't convert anything that had  can be described as "integral and indispensable" into a primary activity which such employee is employed to perform. no employee, in these cases, was employed to perform the act of putting on clothes or the act of picking up equipment.
no, i don't think it is an inducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to requiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've got intent. but i do think that the issue is, you know, really  in the real world, you know, it isn't the case that these guys have gotten immediately sued. that's just not right. and the  and the reality is that what happens is what happens here. there's perfectly valid uses 
it cites rcw 9.994a.125 and 9.94a.310. is one of  is one of those the 3-year enhancement?
well, then where is the authorization? i think that's what justice alito's question goes to. you have to come up with some statutory authorization to pay expert fees. now, attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any costs. it just says whatever costs are otherwise authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.
 one of the judges said, it may have made a difference. of course, they had before them a motion to vacate the  the sentence at that time, and they denied that motion. so apparently it didn't make a difference to that judge. two other ohio courts have independently reweighed all of the evidence and found that the death sentence was appropriate.
but what  but what does that benefit you? i mean  i guess this is justice scalia's question he asked earlier  the treaty is  it seems to me if you're willing to override a duly enacted statute, the treaty shouldn't have any greater status.
 well, it does seem to me that 
 stamps said no.
 separately, then when you sell a cake 
that's correct. and those prosecutions were inconsistent with the written guidance of the department of justice in a longstanding interpretation of the hobbs act, at least since 1965, that it required an intended robbery or extortion.
what's the effect, in 1512(b), of the word "knowingly"?
as briefly as possible, official one, two, three.
that's correct, your honor. we think that 
well, your honor there is testimony in our case, in the california case, that a few doctors that testified said the beginning at approximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women the option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before the procedure began. but the testimony was also overwhelming, including from the government witnesses, that that injection procedure carries significant risks for some women. for example, women with either susceptibility to infection, like women with hiv or hepatitis, you definitely don't want to do an additional injection. that in addition 
yes, justice kennedy. in our reply brief, we do cite to collier, where we talk about exactly that scenario and it is described. and it basically works like this. a claim under the bankruptcy code is defined under section 1015. the claim includes any right to payment whether it's contingent or fixed, matured, unmatured, et cetera. any right to payment, literally any right to payment, when the debtor files for bankruptcy, that becomes a claim. if the right 
are the police instructed  the city police instructed about when the telephone warrant procedure is appropriate?
that is correct. our position is that as a matter of substantive antitrust law, what this court said in matsushita is that antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct. and if all you have is parallel conduct that's consistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on the other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you cannot draw an inference of the sort that the plaintiffs depend upon in this case.
under california, they're advisory anyway. i mean, even if the judge makes the necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose the lower one.
so they could have banged on the front door.
well, i think the fact that the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in erisa, employee benefit plan, is significant. erisa was one of the most substantial legislative accomplishments of that decade of the 1970s. and so i think the mere fact that the exact same language appears in both places, importantly, however, with  without the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4) that exists in erisa itself with respect to workers' compensation plans. i also think that if the court does look at the legislative history, what  what one learns from the legislative history is that when the bill was originally introduced to  to create this priority, it created a priority for  proposed to create a priority for pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit plans. the union representatives came in to congress and said that's too narrow. we need something significantly broader to ensure that the full range of employee benefits is protected and granted this priority. what the union representatives all urged congress to do was to adopt the erisa definition wholesale. now, we don't have anything in the  in the house or senate report saying that's what we did. in other words, we intended to adopted erisa wholesale, but we do know that is what, in fact, they did. they used exactly the language from erisa and they moved it into the priority in section 507.
well, it's what the 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the fundamental question that's posed in this particular case is whether or not the court of appeals by adopting a rule that declares categorically that three out of the four traditional factors for deciding whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been infringed. the rule in the federal circuit for at least 20 years has been that if you have validity and infringement decided by the jury, that then there is irrebuttable finding of  of irreparable injury, of inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue that remains available to the defendant in that circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard of whether or not the  the public interest commands that an injunction be denied in a particular case. and even in that context, the federal circuit's rule is extraordinarily stringent because not just any public interest can  will satisfy, but instead, it has to be a public interest that endangers the public health.
well, i think that the court decided that it made a difference, and i think in terms of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps flast is going to be overbroad and the need to have congress involved, which i think is key  there was no congressional involvement at all in designating those properties and there is in the appropriations context, and i think that's a key difference. but i think what's important here, and the court's colloquy in the first part of the argument showed me this  but the government's position, the idea that it's only grants to third parties  - the government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, because all it is is executive pay; and the idea that there's some difference between a bowen v. kendrick situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion in terms of where it was going to give the money, and the situation here, which is the exercise of precisely the same executive discretion, makes no sense. the injury is the same. the conduct that's  that's the core of the violation is the same. it's an executive branch decision to use funds in a way that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and we've been drawing the lines that the government has been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of what madison was concerned about. so our submission is that that really makes no sense. there's no basis in history, for example, for the government's claim that executive branch decisions are somehow different and insulated with respect to spending. it's the spending of the same threepence, and if history indicates anything it's that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the king as on the parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood. and for the idea that the executive would be given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to spending and there would be no concern about the types of injuries that gave rise to flast we think is just not right. if the court has no further questions, thank you.
yes, it does, your honor. but it does  it refers to it in the context of phases two and three. and the simple fact is that until there's clinical trials in humans, there's no way tell whether this drug is going to be effective.
yes, if i could 
60 days runs after his final conviction and then between the 60th day and the 365th day, he has discovered his brady claim and has not got into court within 60 days.
your honor, i think, in that situation, that the two are very similar, in the same way when a state sells at a state liquor store 
mr. stewart, i'm trying to understand not your theory but its concrete applications. here we're dealing with the rent to be paid by a lessee of a gas station, but what you're saying, i take it, would go for any kind of rent control. you could make the same argument. so you're  so you are saying that rent control is a taking and the state could do it with compensation?
so, there's no way, i  under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind.
so we don't really know 
your honor, this court does not have to get into rule 50 review of the evidence here 
and the only reason it's a water of the united states is that there are some puddles on this land. right? and if there were no puddles, it  it wouldn't be a water of the united states. it would just be land of the united states.
of course you can ignore it. official that doesn't prove anything. you could ignore an agency complaint, too 
yes, sir, we do, your honor. we know that. and it is throughout our brief. there's many mentions of it, the fact that there have been non-native-american members since the beginning of the native american church. i would direct the court to the easiest one, which is at the joint appendix at page 500, which is a memo from a dea legal counsel talking about this. and, in fact, at the hearing in our case, on the very last day  it was on november 2nd, 2001, at page 1933  mr. adam zubin, representing the government, specifically said, and i quote, "the federal government places no restrictions on who can participate in the native american church." so, we have two things. we have the exemption in 1965 
because then 
yes, congress has done nothing about this, has it? can  has the tribe asked, administratively, for the bureau of indians affairs to recognize it now as a tribe?
oh, i think  i think you may have misunderstood. the immunity is not from suit. it's an immunity from damages and the impairment would be the immunity from damages. section 332 is not designed to impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not immunities from suit. they are generally from damage liability. the officers are subject to suit because these are subject 
one quick question, if i may. would one of the issues open on remand be the construction of the contract? is there an issue at state law as to whether travelers pays for these particular services?
 which is an interesting point because if zurich prevails, we have the  the camel's nose is under the tent because in all the self-insurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an equivalent claim to zurich. under their broad reasoning or broad interpretation of the statute that should be considered narrowly  under the broad interpretation they want, that camel's nose would be under the tent, and the bond issuer would have an equivalent claim to zurich on its policy. to extend that a little further, what zurich did here  was an insurance company  it required letters of credit of howard delivery, the debtor, to issue its policies. it drew down those letters of credit $1.1 million. f&m bank, the letter of credit issuer, of course sought security from the debtor, but not enough. as is commonly the situation once the liquidation is finished, there wasn't enough security. so f&m, which had facilitated zurich's workers' compensation insurance by its letters  letters of credit, would have an equivalent claim to zurich as well. so more and more of the camel is going under the tent. this is a very broad interpretation with major implications that they seek and it is completely inappropriate under the bedrock principles of approaches to priorities under bankruptcy law.
the agency pointed to the term "air pollution agent" in the statute, and concluded that because global climate change was not air pollution that congress intended to address 
right.
so 
your honor, it's certainly true that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs. but in the cases we've cited, including two i just cited today, it applies to defendants, as well, because rule 17 doesn't confine the limits. in navarro, the court said that it articulates the same principles, but it's not completely congruent with the "real party to the controversy" test.
but is sudden provocation or heat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part of his  one of the  is it a matter of defense?
well, i don't  i don't agree, your honor. the way  the way we look at the congressional intent  this court has already decided in  in several cases that congress left it to the court to decide which persons are  should be granted jones act seaman status. this is what the court has said. why then would the congress in  in the same statutes have sort of handcuffed the court by saying it's for you to decide who's a jones act seaman and who's entitled to those special protections, but we're going to handcuff you and  and say this is what you have to decide as far as vessel is concerned? 1 u.s.c., section 3 was not followed. i should also point out that the petitioner is a recent convert to this position, and it  it hasn't been followed in the circuits at all. there isn't a lot of cases out there where a lot of circuit judges have stated section 3 should be the definition for the jones act.
no, i knew that, your honor.
well, if his union had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to make him go through it, but they didn't do that.
one of the things i think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. it's not open-ended. under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never really quite have that assurance, would they?
the other two are, your honor, that we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to establish the system that reduces the amount of waste that we generate and recycles as much as possible. that's not necessarily something that the private sector would do. a landfill is not built to discourage the amount of waste that comes through it. our system is designed to try to change the habits of our citizens and increase recycling 
no. i think if  if we  if this court adopts the position the petitioner wants, they would be deemed a  a citizen of north carolina, not south carolina. and if i had  if i got into a controversy with them about something in my account, i would have to go file court  file suit in a federal court to bring them to south carolina where i would be drawing a jury from 8 or 10 counties as opposed if they were a state bank or 
if it's an undercover law enforcement 
it's only there that they've required it, but lower courts now defense counsel are making these arguments that, boy, you know, and the judge is concerned this is a strategy decision.
that's the only thing we know for sure that they voted on.
well, we could say is their opinion  that's their opinion. it's beside the point, et cetera.
i think that what the court needs to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in relation to third-party consents, generally. matlock makes quite clear that if the objecting  potentially objecting party, the target of the search, does not voice an objection, then the third party has full authority to allow the search, even if they're 
i understand that, but 
but the creditors aren't official going to let him just run away with the assets, are they?
suppose i took justice scalia's rule and i said, that's the rule. now, i would say that's the rule of a federal law. very well. that turns on your decision here being final as a matter of state law, but it seems to me we have state courts here saying, at least for double jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of state law. and therefore, i want to know how we reach your conclusion here.
well, it has been established since the beginning of the national banking system that  and this goes back to the history of the first and second bank of the united states in mccullough against maryland  that the national banking system is protected from possibly unfriendly state legislation.
i'm sorry. i  i didn't mean to suggest that. i was sort of just describing how other states do it and the relevance. then they also  many of them have  they articulate it different ways, but it's basically relevance with a 403 type of exclusion, that if the evidence doesn't meet the third party guilt evidence on its own terms, doesn't meet a certain quantum, back  doesn't get over the laugh test, then it's not admissible. other states do it and they say, well, it's got to create a reasonable inference of innocence. that's fine. or it must create a reasonable likelihood about the defendant's guilt. that's fine too.
well, i 
probably not, justice souter, that you would analyze that under strickland and you would find that that's not the reasonable performance of counsel in that circumstance.
yes, of course. and another route is simply that the agency has 
well, i'm not quite sure what it means to say that you otherwise prove a violation in that example.
presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability. if they said this subsidiary is a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be obliterated.
yes, because the state court found it timely, and that would be 
it was made in the senate.
do you think there would be a case or controversy if genentech were suing to establish the validity of its patent?
i'm  excuse me, justice. and again, i wanted, as i was saying to justice alito, you do need to distinguish between patents and claims. and claim 13 is the only claim that's been asserted here. it's the only claim that's being challenged. and let me just 
 liability for a slippery fall in the post office.
may i ask one preliminary question, mr. phillips? do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?
we don't accept that, but even if that's the case, the rogers  the parties to rogers immediately interpreted that decision as affecting proximate cause. twelve years later, this court did say that in crane. the lower courts have uniformly, nearly uniformly interpreted rogers in a certain way. and at this point, stare decisis suggests that this court should not overrule.
and was that this habeas? then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?
no, but it  but it would mean that just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some categories and not to others, so also, by parity of reasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some categories of violation and not to others.
considering that it's a summary judgment issue.
certainly, your honor. and applying  because when we  when we take a look at penry i, this court said  in response to a teague argument by the attorney general, this court held that penry got past the threshold teague issue because of  at the time of the finality of his direct appeal, in 1986, the rule was well-established that the sentencer may not be precluded from considering relevant evidence in mitigation, by lockett, eddings, and others. so if that was a firmly established rule as of 1986 
yes. the literary agent 
it dealt with that. i mean, specifically at the legislative history level, it dealt  it enacted that statutory exception because some states had made these types of business crimes punishable by more than a year. so that's what it was responding to.
simply the aedpa 2254(e). i don't have a specific case that also would go directly to that point. your honor, i would also 
but it refers to his rights, to make it clear that the consular office does not have the right to contact him in the situations where he would prefer not to be contacted by his consul.
two in 20-something years.
that's correct.
it's draconian because by the time the prisoner refiles his or her action there could be a statute of limitations problem. the prisoner may not be able to bring those claims any more. in fact the fifth circuit in 
but 
i was unable to find one, your honor.
suppose 
you  well, you can have such a dispute on a theoretical question between, i don't know, the aclu and the national rifle association, but that doesn't create a case or controversy. what is the injury, the imminent injury to your  to your client that is the basis for the case or controversy?
your honor, i don't think that's the 
for all of the affirmative defenses, i think that's the  the leland decision would allow a state to do that. leland said that you could put  require the defendant to show beyond a reasonable  i'm sorry. is it leland?
i would not, your honor. in our brief we did list a number of felonies that mr. harris, that we believe he committed. but i would go back to garner, and garner says that an armed suspect would have been a different case. and garner also says that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime. so i think the question should not be whether it's a technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to felony, but the harm that is being caused by the continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this case. and if i could respond to justice breyer's question about what to do in terms of responding to mr. marx's question, i think the ornelas case says that you would review it for clear error. and in this case you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the lower court.
right.
and that's this  that's the first of the two periods that's involved here.
 put them in the whole bag. say give the employee his appeal because most of the time it's totally to help him from being harassed. now, what's the answer to that? and i'm not  i'm putting it because i want to get your answer.
well, your honor, i think it can't be a quantified, quantified inquiry. ultimately this court has never looked at the constitutional question of when an abortion statute interferes with a woman's health to an extent that it's unconstitutional, in terms of how many women are affected. the question is, is how seriously would a woman be affected if she affected? and the evidence here is overwhelming.
here's why. i don't think official there's any dispute under 
well, but the  but the court has  it  the court has regularly  and it has never been an objection to article iii power to give effect to a judgement that has been rendered in another sphere by another adjudicatory authority. that happens all the time with respect to 
i think that's just because each side filed summary judgment. each side filed extensive 
i don't think so, justice stevens. it's the same reason as my answer earlier, which is, i think you have to look at this regime, and read it in light of the 90 years of federal involvement in the regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a traditional federal role in regulating medicine qua medicine. and i think this is on the  on the side of the line of regulating controlled substances. with respect to the commerce-clause issue, i would  thought that one thing that came clear out of the raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is not the class of activities that a state decides to decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that congress decides to regulate. and with respect to schedule 2 substances, i would think this case is a fortiori. we're not talking about substances that are homegrown and are never part of a commercial transaction. and even those who were in the dissent in raich, i think, would think that this was an appropriate commerce-clause application. this case is to raich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to wickard against filburn. it is a much different situation. congress's commerce-clause power is more robust here. i wanted to remark and focus for a minute on what an odd statute oregon has passed. the practitioner respondents point out it is a prescribing law only. and oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the prescription, but not the administration, of these substances. even what oregon does, does not purport to be medicine, as one traditionally understands it. i can think of no other medical substance where a doctor can prescribe it, but not administer it. and i think if you look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is that oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to basically take a federal regulatory regime that allows doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances. thank you, mr. chief justice.
our view was that  that  our view is, justice stevens, that an exception needed to be taken if the master's methodology was under challenge.
not for a false arrest. as long as you're not convicted. so malicious prosecution, you would 
may i ask one quick question?
i don't believe that, that the results are going to be considerable disparity. certainly no more disparity than existed under the mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed particularly. i think indeed there may be more non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity, because it really is kind of idle to talk about disparity unless you are measuring it against something. and 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity is measured 
i agree with that presumption against preemption, where the question is, does this federal statute, which says nothing about preemption, accidentally preempt some state law?  that there, the presumption makes sense. but here, you have a statute, the whole object of which is preemption. and i'm not sure that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on either side of the scale.
well, that's certainly true when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously. or even when the, when the general is enacted after the more specific one and does not thereby limit the more specific one. but, well 
well, you  you could say the same thing about  about a  a second claim that destroys diversity. you could say the same thing. does that  does that  does the absence of diversity in this second claim destroy the diversity that existed in the first claim?
i must be missing the thread of the question somewhere. i was just 
because?
so then the state court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment.
mr. 
well, there might be a pattern over time.
but if 
 those damages advance. colorado's  kansas' view is that commencing in  in 1985, all of the damages from 1950 to the present should receive prejudgment interest. the difference then becomes, if you use the master's methodology, the  the current amount of money in 2002 dollars which colorado would owe kansas is approximately $29 million. if you use the kansas methodology  and this is the impact of prejudgment interest  it would be $52 million. under the original formulation that was presented to the court, the value under the master's formulation, which did not charge prejudgment interest on the '50 to '68 dollars, both states agreed that that would have been $38 million. so from colorado's perspective, having succeeded in our  in our exception that the year should be 1985 instead of 1969, we in fact, under the kansas theory, lose some $20-some million in the proposition, which we don't believe is what the court intended. let me  let me turn very quickly to the model, if i may. the  the issue here is not colorado's obligation to deliver water to  to the river system. colorado has both senior surface water rights and the state of kansas that it has obligations to protect. remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent development can't injure water users in either kansas or colorado. as a result, colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis, water is placed into the river so depletions are  are compensated for in the system as they occur. the problem here is not that process. the problem here is a model that is inaccurate. beginning in your first report, you quoted with favor the special master's comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program, which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago. you indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing.
how could it be 
 seemed to focus on the use of the word "micro color," just the word. it didn't bring up what was new in 1999. that is, a brochure appears where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. and as i understand it, the district court said you could use "micro color" as you had been using it since 1991. it didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. so 
the former regulations were promulgated in 1976.
well, i don't think  i think there is a reasonable argument that could be 
oh, absolutely not, your honor. this court in cope and earlier cases has long equated a vessel with transportation. that's what the first circuit did. they  they needed a bright line. they chose a bright line, and the bright line was transportation. is the structure primarily engaged in transportation or commerce? and navigation, transportation, and commerce are all intermixed, and  and the definitions include each other. and they found that it was not primarily engaged in transportation. it was primarily a work platform doing construction.
 with respect to liberty, as it  it's not disputed, is it, that your client could have had his parole revoked even though the search was suspicionless? so, what we're talking about the difference between revocation of parole, on the one hand, and a separate criminal offense. is that right?
well, they argue very strenuously that this is really just a "group of people" 
mr. utrecht, you  you refer to the primacy of federal courts. i'm  i'm not clear as to whether you are arguing for a different disposition where a suit is first brought in federal court erroneously because there's been no exhaustion and then the plaintiff is sent back to state court from the situation in which a plaintiff does the right thing and goes to state court immediately. now, in that case, would  would you still argue for primacy of the federal court?
i don't think that would be a warrantless search or i don't think that would be a violation. that might be 
there may be an adverse inference that would be drawn from that. there might be issue preclusion. there might be a termination sanction. there's a range, as i understand civil procedure, of  of options that are available. in this context, of course, petitioner asserts that there could be an adverse inference drawn from silence. however, if the standard is, as he proposes, that there is simply a mere inference from which discrimination can be detected, the silence of the striking party may have no informative content.
i  i would respond to that by saying two things. he does say that, but after he says, ladies and gentlemen, i want to address some of  of payton's evidence. i'm not suggesting and i'm  and i don't believe that it applies under factor (k). but then he went on to discuss that evidence. and i agree he did. i certainly can't say he didn't. but  but the real issue here is what effect likely did that have on the jury, and i  i'm indicating that  that given the preliminary  his preliminary part about it still doesn't apply but i will address it, that is unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that evidence could be considered. so it's not at all a concession that occurred in this case whatsoever.
and dr. gross is the one who  14 who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism i 15 think.
but, i mean, they don't have that big burden to show. they have to just 
well, ordinarily in a complaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion and ask for more specificity. our problem 
 and that's in title 28.
he says their claim is  is very simple. you didn't tell us that using this in our kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the weeds.
right. that's why i asked.
no.
well, except that with aliens, they can be deported, whereas a citizen can't be, upon release from prison.
mr. richards, didn't the second circuit say you don't need a plus factor? they said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs could show it, but the second sentence is you don't need a plus factor.
well, of course, if one looks at 1334(c)(2), one sees that congress itself contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction under circumstances where there was no diversity jurisdiction and when there was no federal question jurisdiction. so it  it certainly is true that rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have before it matters over which there would be no diversity jurisdiction.
why not? what in the statute or the law or the constitution says that a district judge, although it might be good form in a difficult case to write more, but i've often written opinions where i say, and the remaining arguments we feel are not sufficient to change the result. that means i don't think they're that great an argument, and i don't answer every single one.
yes.
yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes epa to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? and epa does nothing on the subject of efficacy.
that's contrary to federal law. i  certainly would be severe civil consequences. and my guess is there are criminal consequences for doing that, too.
doesn't that negate your argument that the treaty as such disestablished the reservation?
i disagree, your honor. for the state to put that symbol between its state capitol and the state supreme court is to convey a profound religious message. if you're just saying, now, this isn't there for its secular reason. if someone were to read this monument, one sees that it emphasizes its religious content.
well, i think what's wrong with the argument is that what congress did with respect to indian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and conclude that, for a variety of reasons  and, particularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an independent indian tribe to control its internal affairs this exception applies only to members of recognized indian tribes  that, in that context, balancing all of the relevant considerations  not the sort of balance under rfra 
well, the michigan court of appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support that finding. and this is completely different than in scheiner. in scheiner you had a  a trial, you had evidence before the court. this court noted that the  the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was five times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in pennsylvania. you just simply don't have those facts here. what you have is a discrete or a distinct local activity that is something that doesn't affect the interstate commerce.
sure. sure, he does. and if it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out again.
if you do it with a stay, i mean, i see that disadvantage. if you do it with a stay, the federal judge is going to have to sit there with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, think what's going to happen in the trial at the criminal case which i'm not quite certain yet, and then make a determination. it sounds like a very difficult decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it wrong, sometimes they'll get it right. the defendant might be arguing two different things, you know, one in the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the other to try to get them to go ahead in the federal court. what do you

general clement, if you could clarify for me some  a response that mr. bopp gave. did this ad run, was it broadcast or televised before the blackout period?
well, why isn't that an operative fact?
and there's a textual reason 
well 
does the record tell us that?
okay. i understand you now. let  let me ask you this as a matter of  on  on the second point, as a matter of mississippi law. under the charge of capital murder, was there a possibility of sentencing to life or life without parole, as well as the possibility of the death penalty upon conviction?
i think that would be correct, and that would be consistent with the court's habeas jurisprudence.
they are saying it is likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point for point percentage correlation between reduction of gas and coastline loss. you're saying, it seems to me, that they have somehow got to pinpoint this mathematically 
 but there might, and those people all have the same right.
 or the other.
in any case 
he had a counsel at the plea hearing.
i don't, i don't think that  our complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the money. our complaint is with how much we're being punished and what the procedural regime is that has led official to punishing us.
yes, the percentage goes up, the percentage goes down.
justice ginsburg, my reference was to the fact that every case that has considered the specific  every court that has considered the specific facts of this case, meaning the texas case

in  in the hypothetical. no. i think the government would agree that the rule of ferris and blackhawk, the dougherty rule from the court of claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the 
i think your 
well, there's  there's going to be difficult questions of proof. our position is that, by taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign everybody else to ten point times new roman font, and that they can do some colorful display, but not a mark.
the answer is no. the statute expressly covers this. the last provision of section 507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation situations. so the statute just expressly covers it. they aren't  they don't get bumped up in the line, period. i don't think there's any dispute about that. if i could, though, return to a  a point that 
my response would be that, as the questioning already today in the court has revealed, there are two questions on a fee motion. one is entitlement, the other is amount. "just costs" refers to amount, not entitlement.
most states do have statutes, but a few states by court decision have allowed for the issuance of no-knock warrants. my point 
your  your complaint is no matter how much time you're given 
now, i'm confused. i thought the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of confusion. and i guess now you agree the answer to that question is "no." is that right, you agree with that?
well, i, in no way, think that congress believed that by enacting the special provision for indian tribes, it was thereby opening the controlled substances act to individualized 
what you're arguing is that what is, for all intents and purposes, "conduct" can be infused by the school, at its option, with a first-amendment quality. yet your argument would allow schools to exclude anybody in uniform from a cafeteria.
we do not.
okay. yes. yes.
 why can't you just do that? or is your answer to me, "well, then, it's just formalism, and you might as well rule for me now?"
well, i'm not sure that that was the only concern of the founders, i mean, the  the  you know, the  the fact that  that the state could corrupt the  the statement through the interrogation. i'm not sure that was the only concern. i  i think the founders believed in a judicial system, at least in criminal cases, where the person has a right to cross examine his accuser. whether the fact that the  i am  i'll put it this way. i am quite sure that it would have been held a violation of the confrontation clause if, as the prior example i gave, someone wrote out an affidavit and sent it directly to the court, no intervening police interrogation at all, just wrote out an affidavit from  from france, mailed it to the court, and the court has this affidavit. i am sure that would be a smack-bang violation of the confrontation clause. and there's none of the  the abuse that  on  on which you  you would hinge the entirety of the violation.
you don't.
well, excuse me, justice scalia, but what i think it does prove is that when congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations as to how the creditors could best be protected. let me  let  yes. i'm sorry.
does definiteness describe this second aspect that you've just 
well 
well, i used to teach the subject and i can't say you're wrong. but i knew that it was a fairly common thing to have a certification that gave you a  as a company, it would give them a local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly. and that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, i never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because i thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service. i mean, it's a fairly obvious thing. and i might be wrong and i mention that my memory  i've never focused directly on it. just everybody i read and everything i read, i assumed the constitutionality of this. but of course, memory is fallible, including mine. therefore, i raise the question.
excuse me. you mean it's up  i don't understand that. the judge, in order to issue the injunction, becomes a second fact-finder, and he can find four  he can pick four out of the twelve, perhaps four that the jury had not picked?
all right. now, what is the difference in this case? in this case, we have a private administrator of this federal  of this  of this federal program. there are federal employees throughout the country. they are supposed to receive uniform  reasonably uniform health insurance, and the private administrator wants to obtain money that it thinks it's entitled to to put into the federal treasury. now, aside from the name, what's the difference?
you're talking about the two individuals, but they've been dismissed.
why did they use credit reports? is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk factors generally?
because, your honor, the  it is exactly the tribal taxing authority that interfered. it's a  it's quite a strange form of taxing authority that says you can tax the  you can tax the station, but then  but then essentially have to operate the station at a loss. that's not 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: kansas imposes a tax on the distributors of motor fuel. the legal incidence of that tax is explicitly, by statute, imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the fuel. the tax is, thus, imposed and collected off-reservation from non-indians. the who, when, and where of the tax is all off-reservation and non-indian.
i believe that is  is correct, justice scalia.
 saying something very different there? he isn't  he's not saying, "this doesn't fit within factor (k)." and he makes no reference to factor (k). he says nothing about "extenuating." he says "excuses." isn't that something very different, "excusing" the crime?
yes, correct, justice 
well, just so that i understand 24 your argument then, going back to justice o'connor's 25 question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there 1 for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier 2 conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with 3 due diligence i'm here at the courthouse because, although 4 i waited 10 years, i have brought my 2255 as soon as i 5 learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? your 6 answer to that question, i take it, is yes, he satisfies 7 the statute.
would that apply to a prisoner who claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but was afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks, until the guard was transferred to another facility? and he alleged those facts, and then he was denied relief because it was over 15 days. would that be 
but, still, the question should be broken down into two parts. the  as the court said, in oregon against bradshaw, you have to  it's useful, at least, to separate the question of initiation, which is a more limited question, from the broader question of voluntariness of a waiver 
i  i 
at the 
was in the first trial?
yes.
suppose  suppose i disagree with you as to the standard, that is, i think 704 and 703 both require something related to the employment. would  what would the outcome be? would  would the case have to go back to be submitted to the jury under that standard? what standard did the jury find 
i have  i have two different ways to get to that. first of all, section 1983, by its terms, provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. it also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that are brought under 1983.
a better analogy might be if he had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in some expressive act, and there happened to be a school group there at the same time, could the teacher with that group then have disciplined him for what he was doing?
then, in those cases, you can say the conduct would constitute a felony under the federal statute; but here, if i recall correctly, the amount involved would not have qualified for possession with intent to distribute, under federal law.
your honor, we could have proceeded in state court if we wished. the state, of course, has limited resources, and we learned that the 
well, there could be no picketing for purposes of  no  which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting mr. cochran. but 
yes, although again that  that court had been hearing these matters for many years in  in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.
but  but the  the injuries on the body are simply not consonant with  with that manner of her  of her death. a police officer testified not only to a head injury, but to blood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and bruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face. that simply is not consonant with one whack on the head.
but the question is, how far ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a settlement?" in the sense that you're using that term.
so that wouldn't apply here because you're relying on the contract.
he wants to know whether you would like to be thrown 
you could also  you  you could, but you  and we did take that position in tyler. you could also read it, though, the  the presence of the word supreme court right before and the absence of the words, the supreme court, here and the presence of the supreme court in the first one  you could certainly draw the inference that this was not something  this part of it didn't have to be made by the supreme court. and perhaps congress was recognizing that it  it does take this court a longer time to reach a retroactivity decision than it would take the lower courts hearing cases. once 
perhaps. but that's very different from this case and it's different in that an automobile accident is something that happens all in one moment in time. an antitrust conspiracy like the conspiracy alleged 
how  how do you tell where a bank's main office is?
all she said is, "he's a cocaine user." does that  does that  does that give probable cause to believe that there are  you know, that there's contraband on the premises or

 sort of administrative proceeding. and that raises the strong inference that, in fact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it simply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because they're an exception.
 reading from their brief. what they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence is important. the equivalence of what? under washington law, state and municipal government entities are liable only to the same extent as a private person. and they cite page 825. and they stress this equivalence, because a finding of immunity for state employees under state law does not determine the scope of the u.s. liability, etcetera.
i  i mean, i  you know, one  one way of thinking about it, but i think it's a very rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract. it's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. and i think that  that reflects the underlying reality of these cases, which is there is something inherent in an espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage relationship, you understand that you have no protected status under the law. i think that has, with respect, been clear in the  not just in the totten decision but from the very beginning of the republic. i mean, ever since nathan hale agreed to cross british lines as a spy, it was understood that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that was not recognized at the law. and i think that is  it has always been thus, and i think there is no reason to revisit the 
your honor 
that would be one significant factor to consider, your honor. there are certainly others, but that would be one significant factor to consider. that is true. and i  i suggest to the court that when we look to the legislative history, as the questions were asked about the legislative history, it is devoid of any reference to the commission that recommended the law, the house report or the senate report, or even one stray congressperson suggesting that workers' comp insurance policies should get a priority. not one. the industry didn't even put up a representative to make that suggestion at a hearing. it is devoid of any support for putting this nose under the tent in the way they suggest, and it truly is a broadening. it is not subrogation. the bondholder would not have a subrogated claim. f&m bank would not have a subrogated claim. they would have a claim, a direct claim, just as zurich does here. and i think that the issue we come back to  and i'm glad my brothers ended with that as well because that's where we began. the issue is what is the court's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the priority under subsection (a)(4). it is not correct that this court departs from the idea that priorities are a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality of  equality of distribution. that remains good law, cited by this court a number of times. the cases they purportedly cite to the contrary were plain language cases, were embassy restaurant and joint industries board. this court didn't even feel necessary to cite that principle because of the  because of the plain language. where is the plain language establishing clearly, as this court requires, that this is a plan? where is the plain language establishing clearly that this is an employee benefit? the insurance policy. that's what we're talking about. not the workers' compensation statute. the insurance policy may benefit the employer. the statute may benefit the employee. but we are talking about contributions to an employee benefit plan. zurich's insurance policy is neither. unless there are further questions, mr. chief justice, that concludes my argument.
i need the money. i don't have the money. that's a hardship. if you  if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, i think that's why we would say ira's are similar plans or contracts because this court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. so if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. and that's why in section 
and they  and they could have  they could have named senator kohl, i take it.
well, i think dura is 
they didn't recall it, didn't  did they? did they recall it? they issued it and then recalled it?
your honor, it's not at all clear. and, just as in boyle, when this court faced a situation where it wasn't clear what the federal  or, excuse me  what the court of appeals held, the court , "the best thing for this court to do is to address what appears to be the threshold question that the court of appeals decided," but then also to address the subsidiary questions on the basis of which integra is defending the judgment below.
that's correct.
i disagree with the sixth circuit on that, but i don't disagree with the sixth circuit in that when he actually got to court, he sued four other people who were never mentioned in any grievance by anybody.
i agree with you on that one. but you said you wanted to do something else. you wouldn't say, "we don't want to do something else." you 
but that never 
well, as i said, the  the court's commentary in riverside bayview is not good law because the  the court was not addressing the  a tributary's question in that case, and it was not faced with a commerce clause challenge as it is in this case. and at that time, the agency did not interpret tributaries to include every hydrological reach of the  of the tributary system.
it would be, your honor, or in the case of our case, an employee benefit policy. and i would like to pick up on that, if i may, because it is not 
sorry, go on.
that's excellent.
just to be clear, our answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation, no racial classification, is that it is still okay. now, some members of the court may disagree with us on that. but what i would say is it probably doesn't have that great an import in practice, because although it is easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the absolute and sole motivating factor, i think in this context in particular, i mean, nobody  you know, nobody is trying to do this solely for a race-based motive. in this context, they also have an educational goal.
well, your honor 
well, this court did not 
 made.
there was no lack of standing below. the problem was that the  craig turned 21 while the case was pending in this court. there was standing below. he was 18 when the litigation started.
well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending state suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?
or maybe it's like a trailer. so if we run into that case, we'll deal with it. you know, i'm perfectly capable of thinking that if this is a charge where there is a dispute on the contested point, fine, we won't take that dispute into account, maybe decide it in the favor of the defendant, maybe. but this is not that case. and by the way, if he's going to say, how do you know? i'd say, i know. i know boston and i also know that breaking into a boat at least is unusual. so if he thinks it wasn't that, let him say so.
it doesn't play out that way. doctors do have different dilation protocols, but they are often looking for as much dilation as they can get. on the other hand 
i think if the complaint just gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the relator's possession is just barely good enough to sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public disclosure 
for a time before that ship moves into another market.
yes, but we've got a case in which knocking on the  the noise is so loud nobody can hear the knock.
 is reasonable jurors, who are finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter.
can you tell me just a little bit about that, how it works? suppose that you prevail in this case  and it does seem to me that the  the charging the double doesn't involve modification of the ship, obviously. how does it work if you have, oh, say, an english passenger who buys an english ticket and is charged double  i don't know if that's the english law, but let's assume  then he comes on a cruise ship and he goes to new york and miami and  and new orleans? can he  does he  could he then sue, if  if we rule for you in this case?
right.
that's different from saying not decided. i thought the kansas supreme court didn't speak of not decided. i thought it didn't speak in kleypas about a jury who  a juror who can't make up its  his mind. i thought it said the jury has made  it assumed the juror has made up his mind. that's why i think it's artificial. it says where the jury finds. it finds equipoise as to the mitigating and aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has to find that.
justice stevens, and may it please the court: in the decision below, the tenth circuit stuck  struck down an election rule that has been adopted by nearly half the states pursuant to their authority under article i, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding elections. in so doing, the tenth circuit in our view made three fundamental errors that i'd like to address briefly. the first was the tenth circuit's per se approach to determining whether the alleged burdens here are severe. that's an extremely important issue, of course, because to our knowledge, this court has never invalidated a state election regulation under the first amendment without first finding that the burden at issue was severe. but instead of looking at that issue closely, the tenth circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply assumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any regulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties seeking to define the scope of their associational rights. now, one would have thought that it's for courts to determine the scope of a  of a party's associational rights rather than  than the party itself. but in all events, that was the sum total of the tenth circuit's analysis on the  on the question of severe burden. now, the respondents cite that finding, but they  they make no attempt to defend that approach. they argue instead that the burden here is severe because, at bottom, oklahoma requires a republican or democrat, wishing to vote in the lpo primary, to  to disaffiliate from the party 2 months in advance. but that burden is no more severe than others that this court has found constitutionally acceptable. the burden on voters, for example, is less severe than the burden this found  this court found acceptable in rosario, which was a  a requirement, as mr. poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a  in a party's primary, register as a member of that party some 8 to 11 months in advance. the burden on the party is also less severe than a burden that this court found acceptable in burdick which is that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot gather the necessary signatures, in that case 1 percent of the voting population, 5 months before the primary. it's 2 months here. and it's also similar to a burden that all the members of this court found acceptable in burdick, which was  which was a requirement that a candidate wishing to run on a nonpartisan primary ballot collect the necessary signatures about 2 months before the primary. and the message of these decisions  and i think it's fair to say the holding in burdick  is that requiring participants in elections to take action a few months sooner or a few weeks sooner than they might prefer does not amount to a severe burden. and that's the only real burden here. the lpo has to 
then the 911 statement could come in. right?
well 
but that's  that's the situation in any tort. there doesn't have to be a police report, necessarily, in an automobile accident. and in a  any slip-and-fall or any tort, beyond the motor vehicle accident, it's the same situation. it's not unique to the post office.
how is that, on your theory?
well, only if you assume that letting out the same water into the same river is pollution. it seems to me you're begging the question.
that's correct. you can always posit, under the categorical risk, you could always posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted burglary. and so while you could posit a hypothetical where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think categorically about people who are trying to surmount, get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the court can conclude that it also  within the otherwise clause, the burglary under florida law is not so different from the kind of burglary that congress had in mind that it would just drop out of the picture entirely. armed felons who have the propensity to go into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in the house or right around the house, present the very kind of risk that congress was concerned about.
reasonably  that does not answer the problem.
have funds 
you filed your case 4 days before the execution.
do you have any other cases besides logan?
that's right.
 show it's normal.
no, but your  your immediate concern is how do i get into a federal court. whether you win or lose once you get in there is another problem, but i  as i understand it, that's not what we're dealing with here. and  and the  you  you were kept out of the district court on a statute of limitations issue. if you can say  if you argue all i've got in front of you, us, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all i want under  to raise under 60(b) and i have an extraordinary claim here because of the subsequent artuz decision, that will get you into federal court, if we accept that argument. whether  whether you win or lose, once you get there, i don't know, and i don't know that that's before us.
that's correct, your honor, in people v. easley the california 
does your position in this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?
on which the allegations of the claim is based. in other words, it, it's not  it has to be  and the government says this as well  they say under that section d(1), the relator isn't entitled to share in the proceeds of anything that the jury gives. the relator is only entitled to share in the proceeds of a claim for which they were an original source or for which they brought the  brought the action under, under section b. sometimes the government intervenes and adds its own claims not on behalf of the relator, because it doesn't have authority on behalf of the relator, and it takes the position, i think correctly, that the relator isn't entitled to a share in those circumstances. and your honor, this  the courts have identified all the ways in which this statute doesn't make any sense if it is looked at on 
 hear your word.
i presume, then 
i think the way it's used, it says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a permissible purpose. permissible purpose, that may not be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that your purpose wasn't permissible. and even if they were using it 
but  an injunction pending litigation? is that the idea just until you resolve whatever claim it is they have to  to the money, determine it. it may be a legal claim, an equitable claim, but until you sort it out, you can get an injunction to prevent them from dissipating the  the claimed funds.
 the rest of the 
 don't you  excuse me. excuse me.
now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?
under that  under justice breyer's hypothetical, a court, consistently with erisa, could give an equitable remedy?
and you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. it would violate the first amendment. but since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? it's so easy. say this is aimed at the heartland just as i said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.
 that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that north carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that state?
may i ask 
i mean the sovereign immunity didn't exist from the outset. nothing changed.

what about the case, the name of which i cannot think of, to the effect that requiring procedural action by the defendant which would simply be a useless formality and so on?
 the very narrow 
no, no. we have a genius  we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff that we stole from england, with the  with the  remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners and so forth? this genius comes over here; he looks at a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head, the precise details that nobody else could do. he runs back to germany, and he builds it. well, he has absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex details of this machine.
it said that originally, and the courts interpreted that so narrowly that congress took that out. took the contradiction part out. there was an inconsistency requirement in the statute. congress took it out specifically to knock out even supplementary or 
you're a good lawyer that they hired, and the oneidas may not have had as good a lawyer. i don't think this was done around the campfire, do you?
but do they have to?
well, mr. shapiro, you're doing a good job of defending the sec's interests but your position goes considerably beyond their position today.
two responses to that. in terms of the dangerousness, again, this jury in particular knew that mr. deck had been convicted of murder. they knew that the choice they faced was both stark and very serious: life without probation or parole or death. and so to present mr. deck in restraints could hardly come as a shock. to the contrary, it might be confusing and cause consternation to have a twice-convicted murderer sitting at counsel table no more restrained than counsel or the people in the courtroom.
because i think they viewed those as absolutely synonymous, justice alito, and  and the reason i think that is because we know that in some instances they use including but not limited to, which reflects that congress recognized that includes in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and i think they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it was an exhaustive listing. and also, it's important to look at the other definitions of 1961(4), and i think this is the most important element of the other side's submission in this case because they do no business with any of the other definitions. the attorney general, the definition of property for forfeiture purposes, those are unquestionably exhaustive lists. at least, that's the way i  we argued it. they didn't respond to that. and yet, those are introduced with the term includes. so it strikes me that the best contextual evidence of what congress intended here was that includes would be used exhaustively and that the use of individuals of associated in fact would be used as a limiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive principle that expands the scope of this beyond  beyond  into a realm where it becomes nothing but a mere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today under this  under this particular theory. that's  unless there are further questions about the straight statutory interpretation question, then i would go to the second issue, which is assuming that corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in association-in-fact enterprises, does this state such a thing. and here, you have to go back to the court's opinion in reves, and in reves, what the court held is that liability depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs. okay? so it is an element of rico liability that you have to distinguish the  the corporate defendant's affairs in that case and  and the affairs of the  of the enterprise in this case.
should they 
are you saying that the infringement act that happened in the united states involved no components?
yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship. the more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as i understand it.
so we'd be punishing this person for violating canadian law, and then canada would punish this person for violating canadian law.

there  it is the

 based on the extreme conditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see another human.
even in that case, even in a hypothetical where they used the dog for a toll booth, i have a problem with that. that to me is a search. it's different than  i would assert it's different than if they walked  one of the hypotheticals that the justices asked my adversary in this case, when they asked, well, what if they walked the dog instead around a  parked cars or parked cars at a stadium? it depends for what purpose they want to walk those parked  that dog around those parked cars. my assertion is 
 the state court.
how is that relevant here? where is the post-removal event?
that are operating solely in interstate commerce.
you're now saying majority, not vast majority.
are you saying that the error is simply that it wasn't done via rule 15? what if we were to say that the same considerations apply when it's simply raised sua sponte by the  by the  by the district court? what would be your objection to that?
 that's  that's a deterrent. shouldn't it?
correct. correct, justice souter. but here the succession was determined under the living trust, and in sutton v. english, that's exactly the same scenario. moses hubbard left a 
with respect, justice breyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching the statute. that might be a permissible way of official approaching it if what the evidence on the other side was, that well you know there are cause-specific reasons why you need this procedure. there are particular conditions where you need this procedure. but that's not the evidence on the other side. what their doctors say, the doctors who perform this d&x procedure, the dr. chasens, the dr. fredericksons, what they will tell you is that every single case the d&x procedure is better and safer and they want to do it. and so it doesn't make, i mean congress can't pass a statute that bans procedure a, and that ban doesn't apply any time a doctor prefers procedure a.
that's right. and that takes you down to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10-year limit. but just as today congress certainly is free to say, "from now on, social security benefits and all offsets will be subject to an 11-year limitations period," it doesn't have to expressly reference 207 to amend the debt collection act. the debt collection act is what's being, in effect, amended or an exception. and the debt collection act doesn't contain its own express-reference requirement before it can be amended. congress didn't say, "we're forever binding ourselves," or, "we want some different canon of interpretation here." and so, you have a very extraordinary provision in the higher education act that says, "notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's not going to be a time limit to offset in order to collect student loan" 
i think what's wrong with the logic is what was wrong with the logic of the olc opinion. we don't mean to defend the 
may i ask you this question: it seems to me there are two ways to read the burglary, arson or extortion examples: that they are clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put in the statute to say, even though they don't involve serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered, because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the statute nevertheless defines it. so do you read those terms as giving examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of injury or as examples of crimes that would?
they  i think it's perfectly  well, it's a  it's a  it is a possible reading to say the dta authorized some sort of military commission. the text doesn't say so. it is, of course, addressed to the jurisdiction of this court, and not in any way to the  to the  to the  to the underlying merits. i do think that the  that there is a  you know, a conceivable argument. however, the reason why i think this court, if it did decide to reach that ultimate question, should reach it against the government, is that that kind of back-door kind of  you know, approval by inference has never been sufficient when it comes to authorizing military jurisdiction, in the most awesome powers of the government, to dispense life imprisonment and death. that is, i think, a clearer statement would be required in this unique setting, because we aren't talking about, after all, minor things. we're talking about the most grave powers of our government, the power to dispense life imprisonment and death. and i certainly don't think congress, on the basis of a few hours of debate, intended to ratify this entire apparatus. if i could turn to question 2 and the geneva conventions, i'd like to start with common article 3 and its minimal baseline requirements that a regularly constituted court be set up, and one that dispense  that affords the rights indispensable to civilized peoples. as judge williams found, below, that article does apply to mr. hamdan, and protects him. it's the most minimal rudimentary requirements that the united states senate adhered to when it ratified the convention in 1955. and those requirements 
well, there is the possibility of director- initiated re-examination of patents as certainly an administrative remedy that does exist. but where a case is in pending litigation such as this, the traditional way that these disputes are resolved is for a court to apply the law to the facts and render a judgment on a defense of invalidity which has been pleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement in this case. this issue arises in the context of a defense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and i'm not sure that the patent office really could swoop in and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner your honor is suggesting. the federal circuit in this case applied the approach it's applied in previous cases, which is a categorical approach. the federal circuit says that no matter what might be the nature of an alleged invention or improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim made in an issued patent, no matter how small might be the difference between a patent claim and prior art, and no matter how modest might have been the degree of skill needed to devise subject matter described by a patent claim, the federal circuit says regardless of any or all of that a court of the united states can never, ever sustain a defense of invalidity under section 103 of the patent act except in a very limited and narrowly defined circumstance. that circumstance is a record that includes clear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury verdict or specific finding showing what the federal circuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art teachings in the particular manner claimed by the patent at issue. the decision in this case treats section 103 not, as this court has said, as a codification of a condition for patentability whose benchmark is skill and ingenuity. the decision in this case treats section 1 as implementing a supposed entitlement to patent protection that a court 
that's true of every public employee government  excuse me  public employee speech case, period. almost all of these cases go to summary judgment. they can't be dismissed at the pleading stage, by and large, because they require factual development. so, all that  all that this per se rule does is add complexity and the need for greater factual development. it's not the magic bullet that the petitioners seem to think it is. the givhan case suggests the unworkability of drawing the first amendment line as what's part of an employee's job. conferences between a teacher and her principal take in the same level of generality as writing a disposition memorandum 
oh 
but it does seem that this court was operating on the assumption that the eighth amendment required it to let in this alibi and other evidence.
thank you, mr. chief justice.
yes.
are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in florida, had been brought or removed in  more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the federal court, the federal court should do just what the florida supreme court did? or would the federal court say, well, we've got our instructions from prima paint? it says excise the arbitration clause. if that's okay, we decide the other questions.
well, i think whether you look at it from her perspective or from the officer's perspective, that something did change in the moment between the oral statement and the affidavit. if you look at it from  from the officer's perspective, once amy hammon disclosed to him what had happened and  and gave him information that he needed to handle the situation, then he could go about handling the situation. he didn't need the affidavit to do that. once he turned to get the affidavit, he  he was transitioning to  less from an emergency mode and more to an evidence-gathering mode. if you're  if you are looking at it from the standpoint of amy hammon, then at that point, when  when officer mooney is  is in the house and has her husband, you know, in another room and she's trying to just describe what's going on so that she can be protected, that's a far different mind set.
not  not even to prevent retrogression, which would violate section 5.
well, why shouldn't  why shouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to the state court and exhaust the state court claims? here that wasn't done. the petitioner eventually ended up in federal court with a laundry list of 30-some unexhausted state claims, for goodness sakes. why shouldn't those have been presented in the first instance to the state court?
but if the employer can show in fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is prejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of the claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable defense such as laches. i think it's important to keep in mind that this is not the first time that this court has struggled with this question when does the unlawful employment practice occur in a disparate pay case. this court confronted precisely that question in bazemore and held that  and rejected the fourth circuit's interpretation in that case that the present payment of a disparate wage was simply a consequence and not in itself a present violation of title vii?
 get to the issue, in accordance with justice breyer's question, whether or not the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving us with the position of the united states that the congress may validly suspend it inadvertently. is that really your position?
so, if you're correct, how would the result you want affect all the other creditors in these bankruptcies?
well, which of the ones that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a percentage of market value?
right. what was the main 
i can see how you would read it that way, your honor, but the offense 
that is our argument.
yes, but the petitioners requested it. did  did you oppose that request below?
justice kennedy, that's not precisely accurate. the way it would describe it is this. as to the first question you have to ask, which is are the tributaries covered, we think an important component of describing the reach of the tributary system is whether there's a hydrological connection. on the second  and that's subsection (5) of the regulatory definition that brings within the scope of waters of the united states tributaries. then you get to the second question which actually implicates another subsection of the definition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent wetlands. and as to the adjacent wetlands, as the carabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn on hydrological connection for purposes of asserting the corps' jurisdiction.
that would be narrower ground. that is certainly our fallback position and we would not be at all unhappy if the case were resolved on that ground.
no, your honor, because congress has not mandated, as it could have done, that the choice of the specific interpretation from among the permissible options must be identical across both programs.
and yet, you  you acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.
well, he may have done it voluntarily here, but i find it hard to believe that he could be subpoenaed, when  when he has absolute immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a suit against somebody else. it seems to me a very strange kind of a 
it's an extreme case, because there's insufficient evidence?
so judge  judge bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor? he dissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the basis of on clearly established law.
 or the issue letter, but either way 
well, what it says about 
well, the  "loss" doesn't cover mail that would be delayed or damaged.
that's not an aggravating factor. it's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime committed by other individuals. it's not an aggravating factor.
yes, i did. i filed that about a month ago.
later on 
isn't  isn't that your standard?
why can't  why can't the batson question similarly be decided but decided under state rules of procedure?
yes, but the point we've tried to make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop his claim about whether his  whether he made that statement and whether he intended to instruct his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence. he submitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had told me there was this evidence of a genetic predisposition to violence, i would have allowed that to be presented. the court  there was no need for an evidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted  accepted as true that landrigan would have provided that testimony.
we don't think it does. under the colville's decision, if the state is not just  or the tribe is not just marketing an exemption from state taxation, we think that the tribe  that the state tax is preempted there, as well. but here, where the tribe is asserting not simply a commercial interest, selling at market value and not marketing a tax exemption of states 
well 
yes.
right, but the reason why is that there is a body of case law that determines  that's told us what that means.
may i ask you, what would you do if arizona had a statute that said that any company that contracts privately to do mine inspections must obey the standards in the federal guidelines? what would the standard be?
that's correct, your honor, and those are the neill v. yett and the thompson  thompson v. deloitte cases, which i was reading to before. and the court said as a matter of law, the final probate court judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance expectancy because, in light of the final invalid probate court judgment, appellant has 
justice ginsburg.
 a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially 
so are you saying that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component?
yes. i'm focusing on the definition of "drug-trafficking crime." it  also, there's the illicit trafficking piece of this. and, i should add, any state offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be an aggravated felony. we recognize that. if there are no further questions, i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
thank 
i did  i did have one 
our definition 
well it there, if there's a minor variation, you know, something like that, i certainly don't think that disqualifies the relator from, from being an original source. and again, here he wasn't an original source even under his own theory at the outset of the case. what happened at trial is the one little thing that he knew or claimed to know, his prediction that a pipe would have a problem five years before, was dropped completely from the case. so he went from being a relator who knew something very small about the case or about the theories to nothing at all. it was never good enough, but certainly once, once that theory was  once that piece of information dropped out, it just demonstrated, it just highlights that he's not an original source. and your honor, here it wasn't just that they didn't want to use that bit of evidence. it was actually inconsistent with the theory that they, that they pressed with the jury. they said the equipment was fine. rockwell was making pondcrete just fine from 1985 forward until it stopped adding the cement. and that's what they  that's the theory they went with. but again, measure it at the outset of the case, and he still wasn't an original source. if i could save the remainder of my time?
no, chief justice roberts. you can readily divide the court's precedents into two categories, those where there was impermissible interference and therefore no jurisdiction, and those where there isn't. on the impermissible interference side, you have a case like federal court cannot determine the validity of an estate plan, armstrong, gaines v. chew. a federal  a federal court cannot determine 
i think, you know, traditionally this court has been very deferential to state decisions on  you know, on efficacy, on whether a particular program is going to be efficacious  i mean, cases like martinez-fuerte and the sitz decision involving checkpoints for drunk driving  in a court. even with, you know, very strong, you know, low efficacy rates  in, you know, a program that's showing very low efficacy rates, the court said that these are judgment that  judgments that the states need to make, and they ought to be given a lot of deference, even if, you know, their  the numbers, you know, of  don't show, by clear and convincing proof, that the problem isn't being ameliorated.
right, but the 
and neither did the instruction. it just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also. but rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the slightest. and that has been the law for 50 years. and it would be a massive change in the law, as justice scalia said earlier, for this court to depart from that at this point in time.
i think  i think where i would disagree, your honor, is that the entry is lawful  in fact, it's not simply authorized, it's commanded by judicial order. the use of force 
oh.
well, there  in  in answer to your question, there's never been a  a requirement that a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a constitutionally acceptable alternative.
you  you have piqued my curiosity and  and didn't satisfy it. you say there are variations on make-whole. what  you were about to describe the variations. what are the variations?
but the only way that the petitioner could exhaust that claim in state court on a second round of post-conviction review would be to put it in terms of ineffective assistance of first post-conviction counsel. and, of course, he can't then take that claim and come to federal court because claims of the ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel are not cognizable on federal habeas review. so not only did he wait 4 years when he had no filing deadline impediments to come to court, but he then raised in state court claims that he couldn't have turned into exhausted federal claims anyway in order to add to what was available to him, to the universe of claims that were available to him after his initial round of state post-conviction review. and we're talking about equitable tolling for somebody who only has a problem because of his own inaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 3 years in state court on claims that he couldn't bring to state court, and even then, in the face of developing state law about the time bar, refused to look at it. so not only did we have a statute that says you're in trouble, you're time-barred now 
had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.
well, several thoughts on that, mr. chief justice. i think the problem with that approach is that the reason why it makes sense to regulate that very first tributary that flows into the mississippi is the reason that it makes sense to regulate the entire tributary system. all of that water is going to flow down into the navigable waters, and if there's going to be 
i mean, isn't one way to look at this  i mean, the concern is that your constituents probably have a higher priority and a greater concern with the environmental consequences of generating power, while ferc's priority is to make sure that we have sufficient power. and you're likely to weigh these competing uses in very different ways.
 and another discretion.
that, and it is really an analysis of roberts. is, is that judicial determination of reliability under adequate indicia of reliability, so fundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that were, that were arrived at pursuant to its authority must be undone, and new trials must occur with respect to those decisions because it is so fundamentally flawed. and our point is that it is not. it does not rise to that level of inadequacy and crawford is therefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is seriously diminished. mr. chief justice, may i reserve the balance of my time?
yes. well, justice ginsburg, the  the experience of prison administrators is that prisoners are less likely to use religious and legal materials for mischief, and as to paperbacks as well, they do supply an alternative means of receiving information from outside the prison. but again, if i  if i allude frequently to the experience of prison administrators, it's  it's because that's what these  this policy is guided by. newspapers and magazines have a high value to inmates.
i think probably, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that he did that in the context of analyzing the public interest consideration and he said that didn't

 we could  we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on the federal judge to raise it, but the question is, you know, the  it could be a "must," it can be "may not," or it could be "may."
you do not have the probable cause question before you. this dog was determined to be reliable by the trial court and the illinois appellate court, and it was not part of the illinois supreme court's decision.
as such. i mean 
well, respectfully, your honor, i would  i would disagree because that what  what we do have from mr. nixon is he stated that  that he had fired his lawyer. he wanted a black lawyer. he wanted a black judge, and that he didn't want to go into the courtroom because he would be railroaded. that was after in the newspaper it had indicated that he had  that his counsel had pled him guilty in his opening statement, and he was clearly objecting to that conduct.
 the statute actually, you know, now gives some firm statutory basis for that exception, which may not really have existed so comfortably after this court's decision in smith. and there was, it's true, nothing specific in the statute before. the critical point, though, to bear in mind for the sort of claim that respondents are arguing for here is that it would turn over to 700 district judges a determination based on particular records, particular credibility determinations, the judgment as to whether 
what does that mean? what does a fair price in this, in this context mean? does it mean the price that's necessary in order to keep an inefficient competitor in business?

it means that this kind of a situation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was not jurisdiction over that action. so i agree with you that those words are what their claim depends upon, but what is the answer to that contention?
it  it is what it is, justice breyer. the  the oldest case that is in the briefs on the other side is white v. illinois in 1992. so for some 500 years before that. and  and perhaps when we have to draw an inference, we do have  to a certain degree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark. we have evidence that was out there and simply wasn't used. let's look at the history of the marian statutes. and i'm  and i want to refer the court specifically to page 101 of sir matthew hale's treatise. he talks about the  both the problem with the hue and cry and then the reason we have the marian statutes. the reason we have the marian statutes was because for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial reports. they wanted a formal examination of the witness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain the person pending trial. and sir matthew hale at page 101 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue and cry, is that  is that they're not under oath. they don't  they don't even answer all the questions that we would want answered. so what the united states is asking you to accept is that the kind of evidence that the framers would not have even been prepared to allow at a pretrial bail hearing  rather, they wanted to have something more formal  they would now accept to be used in the trial itself. and what we think is that this turns everything on its head. the reason the marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in continental europe that was an accepted form of evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these formal statements could be used. no one ever suggested the hue and cry could be used. finally, let me say a word about police incentives. if you accept the rule that the  that the united states and  and the state is asking you to accept, think about the incentives you put on 911 operators. they're not supposed to ask too many questions. they're not supposed to get too much information. the same would go for the responding officer. they don't want to ask too many questions, structured questions, make sure who did it, make sure they have the details because then somehow these statements become testimonial. what our rule says is it frees the 911 operators, it frees the police officers to do what they're supposed to do, which is immediately start responding and both help people and start gathering evidence from the moment that a crime is reported. and that's what we think the confrontation clause is all about. it's not  it's about the way the case is proved at trial. the confrontation clause  as opposed to other emergency doctrines this court has in the fourth amendment area, for example, the confrontation clause has zero to say about the way police officers do their jobs or the way the 911 operators do their jobs. if they go out and collect structured affidavits under oath, if the 911 operator put the caller under oath, there's nothing wrong with that. if the 911 operator says, i want to be sure i have this right, describe to me exactly what he looks like, and tell me more about him, that's what we would want somebody to do. and we shouldn't put a perverse incentive for these first responders that, all of a sudden, once they start gathering useful information for the criminal justice system, that some sort of new rule triggers. all we're saying is that these are the kinds of statements that were  that the framers would have cared about and that they did care about, and that nowadays if the state or other prosecutors want to use them, they should be duty-bound to bring the witness into court as well to submit the witness to cross examination. if there are no further questions, i'll submit the case.
well, it may very well be necessary depending upon the totality of the circumstances.
that's correct, justice 
right.
regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.
 other words you're maybe entitled to damages. and that may be measured by the license fee that you agreed to pay.
thank you.
 here's my problem with your assertion that we have to decide it in the way that furthers the purposes of the statute. we said, in other cases  and correctly, i think  that no statute pursues its purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon its purpose. it, of course, wants students who need this special help to get it, but it also does not want students who don't need this special help to get it. and for you to say, "there's no harm done." you know, "if he  if he's given it when he doesn't need it. what's the problem? he goes to a better school." the problem is that this is not play money. it's coming from somewhere; and, namely, on the citizens who have to pay for it.
well, you know 
they are not in the record in this case, your honor. they were in the record in the hampton case, so if you read the hampton 2 opinion you will see that the district court included a lengthy footnote in which he basically summarized those scenarios.
oh. but of course, i want to injure competition always when i in fact sell at a lower price that i very much hope my competitor can't possibly meet, indeed would go out of business. i cheer. i would love to get a monopoly. i would love to make a better product, lower prices, et cetera. do you see the problem? and so what you've told the jury there on that instruction 
on that one point of the blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on  or the victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers? on that one point, do you claim that the district court was clearly erroneous?
suppose they didn't have all the information. suppose you enter into a license agreement  you're convinced, as the one that's going to pay the license fee, that it's a good patent  after the agreement's signed, the technological advances, other disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient. could you sue then?
and you have in one of these cases, the person has said: i didn't know who was the person who said i couldn't have the operation until the prison identified him.
but you say this is 
all right. well 
but what  what i mean is could you have  without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? i'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.
i think that that is right, justice kennedy. i suppose that if the perceived constitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of likelihood that is required, it could be applied simply at the summary judgment stage; but to the extent that the court believes that it is a matter for the jury to determine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an inference of the requisite strength then yes, the jury would need to be instructed in a manner consistent with the strong 
well, but only  presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the good samaritan law.
yes. it was handwritten 
 an enforcement action.
not by this treaty. but that  marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically covered by the 1961 treaty.
i think, your honor, justice scalia, if you imagine a situation, as justice kennedy was posing, where the jury was presented with two options and they were going to choose one or the other, you might be able to make that argument. but here, the jury was presented only with the definition saying deadly weapon is a firearm, whether loaded or not. and under those circumstances and under the circumstances where the only weapon associated with this assault is a firearm, the only thing that they could have premised their decision on was the firearm. so, as i say, it's not as though they were choosing either or. in justice kennedy's hypothetical, you might have had that situation.
and that is correct. because these districts particularly in new mexico serve a unique purpose. new mexico has pockets of, of urban and populations, and then they have got small traditional villages; they have got farming communities; they have got indian lands; they have got military bases. and a school district whether it educates 100 children or 1,000 children or 5,000 children has a special value in the state and in our educational process. and simply because a child in new mexico attends the school district that does not have particularly many students in it doesn't mean that he has to suffer a poorer education than his brethren and brothers and sisters in the metropolitan area.
it's indefinite because we don't know where our thoughts will take us? suppose there a patent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for 10 minutes. i mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly definite.
 you're avoiding my question.
yes, your honor. it's in the appendix. and what the judge 
yes, perhaps convicted terrorists. you know, that  and it  that's very different from what we have here, because 
no  no question about that. at  at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they  they both have it. i  i grant you that.
i think that it was primarily, it was, the debtor was litigating and we did not make the jurisdictional argument.
you say regardless of the strength of the evidence. how about no evidence at all?
allows you to come into court if the claim that would have been brought against you would have been brought in federal court, and the claim that would have been brought against you would have been under arkansas law.
it  compliance with state procedure informs the inquiry and once  once we have what is determined to be a resolution 
the oregon question.
well, your honor, the court, last year, in alaska versus epa, said, there is no single rule, or principle, governing the allocation of the burden. and in that case, this court also said two other things that are important here. one is, it put the burden on the government in that case, regardless of whether the government was the plaintiff or the defendant. so, the idea of burdening the party who initiates the proceedings was rejected there, and this court said it looked at the purposes of the statute and saw no reason to place the burden differently, depending upon whether the government came to court as the plaintiff or took unilateral action forcing the other side to come to court where the government would be the defendant.
but in your view, is based on reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative defense?
it would still apply because different factfinders, different juries, might reach different conclusions on the same evidence, assuming that a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper. what you're doing is preempting, you're allowing a potentially aberrational verdict, which there could be in many cases, to preempt the work of other juries. the whole essence of the idea that we were trying to convey official here and the legal principle that we are arguing today is to confine the jury to its proper domain and its domain is the case before it.
i think 
mr. chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count? after all, we have had the question of prayer in schools, and the court has said that that was not all right. prayer in the legislature was distinguished. so it's not just prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it is okay.
this case, your case?
what i would say, mr. chief justice, is that if the tributary flows in. i would start with the tributary, and i'd say, now, there's clearly a significant nexus between the tributary and the navigable waters to which it flows. i would then look at the wetland, and i would say for purposes of the regulation of adjacent wetlands 
does that imply that your answer is yes to the question? if we say, as you urge, a dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to parade up and down every street in the country with dogs sniffing car trunks.
there's  under the statute, her assignment  she has a duty of cooperation, first of all, to cooperate with the state in receiving these recoveries. the assignment allows her to bring a lawsuit. it does not require her to bring a lawsuit. primarily the obligation is on the state to sue 
yes, it could, and the fcc could double fine  the fcc could do lots of things. that's our very purpose, is that the fcc ought to be the single forum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is best, not leaving it to federal courts across the country. and as ninth circuit invites, state court rulings across the country with varying rules. official if there are no more questions i'll reserve the remainder of my time.
that's absolutely correct, your honor. we would suggest that, in keeping with the consistent holdings of every circuit court that has addressed this topic, it would make sense for this court to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or, at the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles, any obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are prudential obstacles, rather than article iii obstacles. there are actually other reasons why we believe the article iii barrier is crossed. we believe that this case  that, as judge posner wrote in a recent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the court  it came out after our brief was filed  in his analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he concluded that the court's burden on taxpayer standing was based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds. we believe his analysis is correct. once this becomes a question of the prudential standards, we believe that the very particular factual history of this case provides ample reason for the court to find that there should be standing in this particular case to reach the investment tax-credit claim. respondents brought this case in the ohio state courts largely out of a recognition that the standards for standing were different in the state and federal courts in this area. in fact, if petitioners felt that we didn't have standing in ohio, perhaps the wisest strategy for them would have been to oppose standing there. but, instead, they chose to remove the case to the federal court. and there, we requested that the case be remanded to the state courts, because we identified to the district court the risk, that if the federal court kept the case, we might find ourselves, years later, before a higher court that might say, "but you don't have standing," and require us to go back and begin all over in the state courts. petitioners, at that time, argued that, in fact, we did have standing. and the district court so held. and then petitioners have not again raised the question of standing until before this court.
we don't take a position on whether there's a constitutional problem with regard to non- germane expenditures, your honor. but we do believe 
it does, because if the employer makes a judgment  as i said before, if the employer makes a judgment that the employee has carried his job duties poorly, incompetently, insubordinately, and so on, that interest is  it's either dispositive of the balance, or it's nearly so. and it  so, from that standpoint, the court could put a gloss on the pickering balance that explains or emphasizes that the employer's interests are controlling how the jobs are performed, prevails. but to get back, for a moment, to the 
you're looking at what texas law forced him to do.
statements in furtherance of a conspiracy, if i understand 
but if he did, he would be making a credibility determination, wouldn't he? he would be deciding an issue that normally would be submitted to the jury.
so you're arguing they've waived the  your argument is they waived the objection basically.
there  your honor, there are varying degrees of specificity, but yes, they  in some cases they do provide for that explicitly.
well but, justice kennedy, precisely because you can't engage in just a formless content-based inquiry and precisely because there isn't any neat division between issue ads and candidate ads, that is why you need to have a different regulatory approach. i mean, this court recognized 
well, i think the court referred both in taylor and shepard to the  to congress's approach. and under the statute, that sort of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to crimes that are inherently presented 
so i just briefly want to go, justice souter, to where you started about the consecutive sentence issue. we believe that consecutive sentence is quite different than, from what exists in blakely and that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings of fact. i think you referred to about the crime, about the circumstances, about the character. in fact, in this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial court in order to justify the exceptional sentence  this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of fact 18  if the court were to sentence the defendant to a standard range sentence on each count run concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if he had committed only the rape in the first degree. this would effectively result in the free crimes of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first degree because he would receive no additional penalty for those crimes. now 
and the secretary retains complete discretion as this court taught 
 a few cents a bottle, yes.
why does not having a possessory right mean that the city could tax them, or the state?
that's correct.
well, the context was very different in mullane because in mullane there was a large number of interested parties with very small interests in a trust, and what they were being given notice of was an accounting to settle those trusts. and as long as some of the people who were similarly situated received notice, they could act in a way that would protect other members of the class. here, we're talking about real property with just a single owner, and in this case, where we have an $80,000 house that was lost and sold for only $21,000, it would seem to me that due process would require more than just regular mail.
it's not really clear from the record, justice scalia.
well, i think that our point is that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute because there is this background rule. when a litigant comes to a court that's already abused the court's process or seeks relief of bad faith, it is a core element of a court's inherent authority to simply deny relief. you can toss out an entire complaint when a litigant seeks it in bad faith. if there was an apparent benefit to this, go to 13 first or deny it, the united states trustee wouldn't be here. we see no benefit to the debtor to require the court to convert and then reconvert. all it is is an unnecessary waste of everyone's time, and this is a core element of an inherit authority.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: in enacting the federal tort claims act, congress recognized that suits against federal employees, based upon their official conduct, constituted a very real attack upon the morale of the civil service. congress addressed that concern in two ways. first, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the united states directly, but secondly and importantly, it provided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity, the judgment in the suit against the united states would constitute a complete bar to any action against the employee.
i don't know, your honor. a couple of responses to that. first, to the extent this spurs investment that otherwise would not have taken place anywhere else, of course that's just positive sum. that's new economic development that wouldn't have occurred, but for this incentive, or incentives like it. of course, at some level there's going to be competition for where these manufacturing facilities are located. but, again, this court has noted that competition among the states for their share  or their fair share of interstate commerce is not, in and of itself, a commerce clause problem. the question is only when that competition becomes discriminatory in some way. and what the court has meant by "discriminatory" is, does it somehow tax your decision to be somewhere else? when you decide to be in missouri, does that increase your ohio tax bill over what it would otherwise be? camps newfound, perfect example. you decide that you're going to serve an interstate clientele, your tax bill goes up above what it would be if you didn't serve an interstate clientele. and ohio's tax credit doesn't have that characteristic that the court has found so troubling. in fact, looking back through the court's cases, over and over again this notion of burden comes up, and  whereby, "burden," it means "imposing taxes on the business of other state," all the way back to guy versus baltimore, "you can't build up your commerce by means of an  unequal and oppressive burdens upon the industry and business of other states." so, certainly if ohio were attempting to tax daimlerchrysler, or treat daimlerchrysler worse because it had put a plant in missouri, that would create a dormant commerce clause question. but here, there's simply nothing like that. in fact, respondents' theory would dramatically expand this court's dormant commerce clause jurisprudence, and would strike down a whole swath of state laws that have engendered substantial investment-backed expectation at this point. billions of dollars have been invested by thousands of companies in reliance on various forms of locational credits, whether it be job incentive credits, whether it be investment tax credits, whether it be environmental cleanup credits. all of those credits would be at risk under the theory that plaintiffs espouse. your honors, this court has more than once noted that the commerce clause demands that the states must sink or swim together, but it has never suggested that the states must be indifferent between those two options. frankly, your honor, the states would prefer to swim. itcs like ohio's help the states keep their economies afloat. respondents disagree with this, as a policy matter, but that debate belongs in ohio's statehouse, not here. the itc is not protectionist, and it imposes no burden on interstate commerce. and, thus, it does not violate the dormant commerce clause. ohio respectfully urges the court to reverse the decision below or, in the alternative, to vacate the decision for lack of standing.
now, why would the school district have to take any action? why wouldn't it just 
yes, it did.
it's in  in the chair.
but  and which  many of which may be quite easy to  to dismiss. but i would say ms. bergmann's reading has a kind of  the opposite problem with it, which is under her reading the  no one  when a court holds something retroactive can  is an unpredictable matter. and under her reading, nobody  even where there's a right that's rather important and that should be retroactive, no one could get relief until an appropriate court has held it retroactive, which could take years. it could be never. and if the court  and i think that that reading of that  therefore, i think that that  that reading has just the opposite problem.
of course, i'd be happy to. i don't think it puts the whole scheme aside. remember, the government gets two bites at the apple here. they get a first bite on the categoric approach where all they need to show is that all the elements are within the generic definition of the crime. we'd be dealing with a different case if the person was charged under the penal code which doesn't require  which requires intent to steal and which does not cover accessories after the fact. so the government gets a free pass on round one. on round two, on the modified categorical approach as we're discussing here, the government gets a second chance to  based on actual documents in the record to establish whether there's enough there. here the government relies on the charging document in an abstractive judgment, but the government does not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea allocution, it does not put in any other documents that would establish under shepard that someone was necessarily convicted of the crime. so what  the government here is asking to be relieved of its burden of proof which it has in this case. i would like to note that on the 
well, let me try to make it less bizarre, your honor. what we're saying is, for example, if i had a dispute with john smith, the son, who's not diverse, but i accidentally sue john smith, the father, who is diverse, and he comes in  - he removes, and he comes in to defend, on the merits, that he is not a real party to that controversy, and that his citizenship, under the opinions of this court, would be measured by that of the son to determine whether or not a federal forum is appropriate 
absolutely. and even congress considered 
in sochor.
 at that point 
 the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach. of course, they're going to rehire. i  i find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.
did you establish that in the course of the proceedings?
correct.
that they thought it was obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here with this particular claim is that it doesn't say specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply to. so it isn't definite enough. it never occurred to anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was somehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive context. because for 154 years, it's been clear that you can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters. that's their analogy. and they thought by referring to the cases and by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in the patent field would know. that's at least, i think, what they're saying.
but throughout the litigation?
your 
one way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, i'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in oregon to the jury: "how many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes?" now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility. on the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people. we only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff. but without the instruction official you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in oregon smoking cigarettes?
well, i think the precise answer to your question being none of the land mass  none of the land itself would be regulated. but in terms of  you want to talk about the 
if it met the requirements of the equal pay act, which is that it has to be the same knowledge, skills and responsibilities and effort for the job, then every time that you have a failure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is a violation of the act. but title vii is not an equal pay for equal work statute, it is a nondiscrimination statute, and so that you have to show intentional discrimination in pay, not just the absence of equal pay.
well, why can't the state protect it more? i mean the fact that hudson would be adequate  it 
no. absolutely not. the ninth circuit didn't rely on that. it was presented to the ninth circuit but the ninth circuit did not rely on that.
it doesn't show that it was a boat.
your honor, there are 
well, that's not an event. that's  that's an epiphany, it's not an event. (laughter.)
and your 
but there's nothing in california law suggesting that that would be upheld, is there?
absolutely, justice breyer.
in other words, the district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?
for the first amendment. no, i'm not aware of  certainly no decisions of this court, and i think the only cases arise 
well, i guess you can be  depending upon how detailed the opm contract is, you can be consistent with that contract and still have an enormous amount of variation from one to another. it depends entirely upon whether the opm contract is entirely comprehensive. if it covers every jot and tittle, then i guess you can't be consistent with it and different. but if it's  if it's sort of bare bones, you  you could be consistent with that and have a lot of variation, couldn't you?
and they answered no. you say they were right.
your honor, it doesn't meet constitutional standards because it only says the chief has to make a final decision. the chief doesn't have to give any reasons for it, and i don't know of any case in this court in predictive decisions, in punitive decisions where a  a decision-maker can send somebody to solitary confinement long-term. and justice souter, it's for at least 2 years. over 200 people there were for more than 3 years, which was really the  the  only limited by how long the building was open  and say, i'm putting you in there and i'm not telling you why. and this policy lets them do it, and that's what they were doing. and there's nothing in this policy to change that. and what was happening 
yes.
we're talking about 48 prisoners.
 this question? did you engage in discovery trying to determine who the real party in interest was?
but i'm  i'm not sure what the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if they're the same thing.
well, do you mean in an underlying tort action or 
that would be enough to state a claim for attempted monopolization under this court's decision in separate forks.
that's what i don't understand too. that  that's really what most troubles me about this case. why  why do you do this to the transferees at all?
right.
well, i think either one of those would be a constitutional 
even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"? you know, i mean  and some are, i think.
justice stevens, the commission considered that factor and then determined that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence outside the guidelines.
well, what sets the sixth circuit's rule apart from i think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond. in the sixth circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint, they are out. there is no leave to amend, and that's what happened in this case. in petitioner jones' case, he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies. he said: i exhausted my administrative remedies, i filed my step one grievance on this date, i received a denial on that date, and he went down the list through all three steps.
i think the same process of review applies to each. and it may result  and that process of review is on the record in that case, would a reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence? and that review may result in both cases being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being reversed.
sometimes, a defendant, after he talks to his relatives, might conclude, "boy, you know, i'd better cooperate with the police and get a lesser sentence." but you're saying that can't happen. once 
no, i absolutely agree with that. but it's resale price maintenance that enables these initiators, these small companies, these small operations, to grow and innovate, achieve the efficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by reducing prices. and all that is stopped by imposition of a resale price 
what 
well, to have exhausted claims entertained. right? is there some  do you say there is some absolute right to have the federal court hear unexhausted claims?
well, and as i said, i think you have to read that in the context not just of the rest of the regulations but of this court's decision in riverside bayview. the one thing we know from riverside bayview is that it's not enough to simply say that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the navigable waterway because in that case, as the court remarked, it  the parcel ended before it got to the adjacent navigable body of water and there was another wetland. there was a continuation of the same wetland. now, i don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent wetlands. i might as a common locution. there might be some different way of referring to that. but we know that the one wetland was covered because that was the holding of this court in riverside bayview. so i don't think i would give undue weight to that reading of it especially when, if you read it as i do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have the same role to play in flood control in terms of monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue here. and so i think that that regulatory decision that the corps has made is one that's perfectly defensible and makes sense. and i think that  again, i think one other point that i want to note that's kind of specific to this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body, even if there is a berm present, is illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to, the specific development plan at issue here  and this is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160  would sever the berm and create the hydrological link between a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable wetland  waterway system. and so, i mean, it doesn't make a lot of sense, as justice stevens suggested, to have a regulatory regime where you have a regulable wetland after but not before a construction project that has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the wetland.
mr. garre, if you  if you had a situation, say, under title 7  and you pointed out in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most  the person  whether it's social security  the person who is making the claim has the burden of proof. but there is something different about this setup, because the statute does obligate the school district to come up with a plan. and so, i was thinking, if you have a title 7 case, and the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a question of remedy, and the employer said, "i propose this  these changes to remedy the violation," wouldn't the employer in that case have the burden of establishing the adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy the problem?
the heta law, yes.
 the phrase 
how does it work?
yes. i 
among several other things. there is a stronger interest in that, and we are not debating about the forum. again, we have the kircher case from last term saying state courts are perfectly capable of resolving this issue. that is a quotation actually from the missouri pacific case.
a guy comes along in a different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got to  we got to wear medals. no statute that says medals are okay. it  it  you know, i realize the level of generality in your example is higher. the  the discrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty tough job to come up with  would be a tough job to come up with statutes without picking and choosing among religious demands.
but if the police  let's say, focusing on this case, suppose they had looked at this order and said, wow, it gives him weekends with the girls, it gives him summertime with the girls and, subject to his ex-wife's agreement, dinner time with the girls, this can't be all that urgent because if he would harm the girls then why is the judge allowing him so much sole time with them? so wouldn't  looking at this particular order, wouldn't there be reasons why the police would say, the judge is allowing the father to spend time with the girls, this can't be that urgent?
however, in de grandy, the court also said that the assessment is the totality of circumstances in the region under assessment. and in the totality of circumstances, the district court made factual findings against the plaintiffs that they cannot demonstrate were clearly erroneous. indeed, that  that is the problem with all of the district-specific claims that all of the sets of plaintiffs have brought is that this was tried in a full trial. the district court took testimony, made credibility determinations 
when did it say that? i really find it very hard to accept that argument, when its says  you know  it doesn't use lacks removal jurisdiction, that's what it means. it is such an easy thing to say.
yes. that is my understanding.
but 
it's not, justice stevens, because it requires a different level of participation, and the liability is entirely different. because if conspiracy is accepted, you're accepting pinkerton liability. that's what the government's own charge said  the government's own instruction said, which means that mr. hamdan is liable for all the acts of 9/11 and everything al qaeda has done. "aiding and abetting," as you are saying, justice stevens, in your hypothetical, is a much more closely tethered theory of liability, requiring a higher level of individual culpability and a totally different level of punishment.
bingo. that  we live with all that, your honor. to quote  sorry, sorry. (laughter.)
what do you do with the argument that your reading of the two sections means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small number of cases, and it's obvious that congress was trying to tighten the habeas review procedures?
that's a good question. suppose you really had a person who  there's just no comparable private person in like circumstances. i can't even imagine what that could be. maybe you could imagine. but i was trying to think of some secret research on turning people invisible or something for military purposes. i mean, i  it's just hard  i mean, hard here, obviously. there is such a person. there are private mine inspectors.
the district court, the very same district court that the government so, so desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said that given mr. haley's declaration under penalty of perjury, it would not accept that alternative.
well, it's the same problem in the patent area, isn't it? and yet, in the florida prepaid cases, we've enforced the sovereign immunity with respect to patent proceedings.
i think, your honor, it's an element that the district court in the first instance must accept and gauge in determining whether or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true purpose or is a sham. where we're talking about a close time period, here three displays in less than a year by the same officials of the same county trying to post the same document, this case becomes very close to the santa fe independent school district case where it's a moving target in direct response to pending litigation as an effort to try to get the same end result and changing the operative facts just slightly in the hope that eventually it will be right.
it would be exactly the same. we just think that, given the fact that this is an instance in which the ninth circuit granted the writ of certiorari and issued both before  both before the amendment and after the amendment and both before santos and after santos orders reflecting the fact that it believed it continued to have authority over this case, the appropriate outcome in this case is more straightforward than it might be in some other closer instances.
what is your strongest case? i don't think matthews addresses it. what is your strongest case for the notion that you have a property interest even though you don't have a contract?
i think the court of appeals should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of law, which is that the judge 
section 4.1 of the contract says that.
and that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the ten commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse. they could have defended when they were originally sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to modify the display. and when they modified the display, it had excerpted sections around it.
right, i think i understand. i think it goes back still to the fact that there's not a clear congressional expression to take these cases out of the federal rules. in califano v. yamasaki we believe is instructive on that point. in in that case the secretary of the department of health education and welfare had argued that section 205(g) of the social security act, which used the term "individual," somehow took those, those judicial review procedures, out of the operation of federal rule of civil procedure 23. this court said: no, we cannot read the word "individual" as such a clear expression. it may have been congress's policy to have individual claims be addressed one by one, but you have to find that clear expression in the statute and that clear expression is not here.
but  but there is a textual basis for drawing a distinction between admiralty and law and equity. the eleventh amendment doesn't extend to  to admiralty.
well, it's saying, all i've done is limited it in time and space. just as you might say on october the 24th, 2004 at the corner of 14th and third avenue, defendant drove negligently and injured me. that's certainly a complaint, isn't it?
well, this court has recognized in wilson, consistent with the common law authorities, mr. chief justice, that they are connected, that the entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search and seizure that occurs within. and that's why this court in miller and in sabbath suppressed the evidence following knock and announce violations. but in wilson, this court directly stated that the common law, the fourth amendment,  the common law that informs the fourth amendment, directly demonstrates that the framers thought that the method of entry directly affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is reasonable.
mr. verrilli, before 
i would say if that circumstance occurred, that that would be something that the board would have to pay attention to and consider. but the fact of the matter is that 
thank you.
 to make the appointments.
your honor, i'm sorry. i think that a couple things are being confused here.
yes.
are you, in fact, arguing that the statute might be  i know you don't agree with it  might be proportionate and congruent with respect to all of its prohibitions, but, to the extent it provides for a damage remedy, then it crosses the line?
but 
well, they just said that they  congress  that's too strong a statement. the specific congress people involved were glad that the  the wrongdoing was uncovered and said as much and wrote to the attorney general, and the sec, and said why  why wasn't it found sooner? but they did not touch these antitrust actions. number one, they come very infrequently. number two, they've done great benefit for the securities markets and for the participants in the securities markets, and even for the defendants themselves. they forced the defendants to operate by talent and bring out their best, and not resort to what the problems for the public always is 
i believe, your honor 
absolutely.
why is my position that they would not?
why?
well, again, i think that if the issue is whether it was raised below or should be, then perhaps a remand back to flesh out that particular argument would be the appropriate response. i think that in terms of 
but in the race context, it is a dismissal of the prosecution itself. isn't it?
constitutional violations. not just prophylaxis 
well 
i don't believe it would.
apart from the unlikelihood of all those police officers out there. but, leaving that aside, is there  is there any reason, in the standard, that my hypothetical could not be true?
i don't think you need to do either, your honor. i think if we go back to heck and look at the language there that talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something 
i don't know if that hurts you or helps you. i mean, that  that eliminates what seems to me is the strongest argument of the  of your side, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater sanctions upon somebody who  who files a complaint than it does upon somebody who  who violates somebody's race, religion, or whatever by  by discriminating.
 to recruit.
i don't know. you might have written to the secretary of the interior: secretary, i want to you do such and such, please. no. okay, review.
 person, one vote. here, we have a million 
and rust doesn't stand for that.
well, i think if we had gotten all of those sales the first time around, we would have ended up with the profits that would have allowed us to make the sales 
 under your theory?
 applies to something at the beginning of the series. it's got  it's got some work to do. you've made an argument that it doesn't apply, or it would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at the end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle. and why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say, "okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it travels up to the end, and it travels as far as this"?
you  you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and that's what we're asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life? you can't say that?
there's the possibility of individual determinations, based on the individual circumstances. if you went 
it doesn't on  just on the face of it, it doesn't fix the problem that the district court found. vague notice. the other thing they would do is they would give the person notice of one reason 
 proof of that point.
does the school have to be completely neutral in that respect? does it have to punish who says that was a good program, i'm not going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because he's taking position on a public issue?
i would think so, too.
your honor, every case of this court dealing with pleading standards has indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to relief therefore. in dura, for example, the plaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss causation, and the court said 
no. no. well, i meant terminate the chase by  by  by forcing him off the road.
the state can have a monopoly if it's, itself, a market participant. what the state may 
and so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying it abroad.
no, no. the public customers who have accounts with the underwriters; they're also brokerage firms. if they wanted to get an ipo in what we call class security, the technologies securities, they had to pay 
very interesting question, justice scalia. however, this court 
no. i think it is possible that the fcc could determine that any violation of a regulation is unjust, and the fcc is entitled to deference for its determinations about what is unjust and unreasonable, that's been  official
actually, i'm thinking about my answer because i was thinking about borelli. there were three third party culpability, potential targets in this case. and i believe that hurtz, the testimony of several of the witness who were admitted did testify of a link between cindy bell and hurtz.
well 
again, if i may be permitted to finish. the methodology  the methodology of crawford is to look for known circumstances of abuse, about which the framers were concerned, and we don't have that sort of historical evidence more generally.
because i gather you don't have to amend your charter.
may i ask this question on your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument? supposing the statute was broader and said the union may not use any non-member agency fee collections for any non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent? would that solve all the constitutional problems?
yes, okay.
okay.
 argument?
we think that test can work very well in a context like this where we're talking about the display of religious texts rather than just symbols. and the point i think is well worth considering, that we assume that when people post signs or displays, bumper stickers, buttons, that they endorse the content of that text and that the presumption then would place a burden on government to make sure that it is neutralizing the endorsing effect of displaying text. i think that is a very workable text in a context like this where we're talking about the posting of core religious texts.
well, mr. chief justice, i understood justice stevens' hypothetical, and he can correct me if i'm wrong, to posit a case in which there was dynamite evidence that the defendant had a monopolistic or exclusionary intent. but in our view that is insufficient to state a section 2 claim. one has to have exclusionary conduct as well.
not necessarily, your honor. because for those type of prejudicial factors, california is well-positioned to handle those, because they do so anyway in bifurcated proceedings. there are often enhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even gang allegations, anything that's prejudicial are handled at a separate proceeding after trial.
that's got nothing to do with that case. that's got something to do with a judgment apart from the particulars of the case about whether crack should be treated the same as powdered crack cocaine. it's got nothing to do with the individual case.
well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. i think the  the judicial finding that i think would be appropriate, and this court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the d.c. circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the fda, that the underlying judgement of the fda refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. that's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a schedule i substance without a valid medical use in treatment. this is not a situation in  and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. but, here, congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto schedule ii or schedule iii. and i think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. i mean, the fda, for example, rescheduled marinol from schedule ii to schedule iii in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. but i think what's going on with the fda is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine 
if the beating up is  if the beating up is related to, used to extort a confession and the confession is used against him, then there would be a cause of action when the confession is used.
thank you.
we believe so, your honor.
but have i got it right? have i got this complicated thing right?
i  i don't think it's appropriate to presume that an article iii judge would have a defendant imprisoned and committed if he was not actually incompetent. but you are right that the incompetency exclusion is  is, along with the unavailability of the defendant or witness exclusions, are somewhat unusual in that you could discover, after the fact, that they applied. but the reason is that if  if you had tried to try him sooner, you would have discovered the same thing. he actually was incompetent. the witness actually was unavailable. and from a speedy trial act perspective, it makes no sense to say the speedy trial clock ran because you didn't try a defendant when he was legally unable to be tried.
you would have an inquiry into whether there is a categorical taking under lucas because it deprived essentially all economic value of the property and you would inquire under penn central whether  because the threshold inquiry into the nature of the government's interest is satisfied, you then inquire into whether the burden is such in light of the purposes to be served that we believe it goes too far 
justice stevens and may it please the court. before this court is a setting of law in a courthouse and a display on law that contains the universally recognized symbol of law. despite the fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of this otherwise secular display, the sixth circuit struck it down. the court focused solely on the religious aspect of the ten commandments and that's aired by ignoring the overall context. the ten commandments is unlike most any other acknowledgment. it is in a category essentially all by itself. it is thematic in common places in courthouses while nativity scenes and menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on public property. the ten commandments occurs quite frequently and has for more than a century in courthouses all over this nation. it is associated with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because the ten commandments has played an influential role in american law and government and our system of law in this country. the context in this case is clearly important. yet the sixth circuit 
well, your honor, the  the court recognized in the digital equipment case that even a claim of res judicata could correctly be characterized as a right to be free from suit, but it said that that wasn't enough. one had to look at the importance of the  of the value protected, and the 
wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?
we did not waive any of the standing claims in this case. we've discussed that in our reply brief. i've cited pages of the briefs where these issues were discussed. and the overriding fact is that the district court, the three-judge panel in the court of appeals, and the en banc sixth circuit all decided these issues. they have been properly raised and preserved and they're before the court.
 message.
justice o'connor, i  i think that's really up to the party. and i  and i think that gets back to my point about burdick. yes, there is a deadline and if the lpo 
it isn't the fbi that keeps peace on other reservations, is it? isn't it quite standard for state law enforcement to function?
no. and this is why.
take his chance and then if he  if he loses, he gets automatic reversal. so why would he do mandamus?
 you don't want the officer talking to blake directly. i thought that would be another violation.
under the court rule, you admit that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove aggravation by a preponderance. isn't that the end of the issue? i mean, if california wants to amend its rules or its statute, that's california's business. but we can't do it.
there's nothing subversive about that.
and i don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.
if the  if the defendant in that case had established evidence tending to show the essential elements of the claim, it would present a question for the court, but i think the court would use the admission against interest as a basis for paying no attention to such 
 that is correct. and i think that  but with a caveat, which i'll get to  but  i think that is correct, but it is a  it is a consequence of the situation that congress found itself in, in 1996. in other words, it already had a statute, the offset statute, which had a 10-year bar. and so 
 adopt that kind of a standard. i'm sorry, justice stevens?
the  the government took money for its own federal functions instead of  including contract monitoring 
well, but it, it with respect, it is not really a case of having our cake and eating it, too. we are in the area of powers of national banks. and the court has recognized for a century that in that area, when national banks have powers, including incidental powers recognized by the comptroller, they generally preempt any state law that prevents or significantly interferes 
i would 
 address how you apply it here.
i suppose that  i mean, that could be a construction of the statute as long as you let people  people are going to come to federal court first and get  for stay abeyance if you do that. if you don't know until the outcome years later whether you were tolling or not, that's going to cause everyone to file protective filings.
we 
what the florida supreme court did is they found that since this was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, if there was not explicit and affirmative consent, that cronic would apply and a presumption of prejudice would follow.
 i'm still not clear as to what the findings were, if there were findings, as to what the condition would be after the improvement. would there be an increased likelihood of drainage into the ditch after the improvement?
it's different if it benefits 
 giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.
i thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in title vii cases. you can't go back more than two years for damages. but it would seem that doesn't fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.
that may well be.
your honor, i don't believe this does an end run because this is different than  than tolling. first of all, in tolling it's automatic under a statute, and stay and abeyance is always discretionary with the court. the court can grant or deny the stay and abeyance order, alter it, revoke it, or in this case, put time limits on the petitioner's right to go back and  and forth. also, mr. rhines has complied with the aedpa period. he did file. the unusual situation that could result here is if you assume a prisoner b who's in rhines' same position and files at the same time, when only approximately 9 days have elapsed on his aedpa period. petitioner b, let's assume, files three claims: one exhausted, one unexhausted, and one there's a dispute over whether it's exhausted or not. because petitioner b had a short trial perhaps or draws a different judge in the district of south dakota, the judge can rule on that case perhaps within 100 days. it gives petitioner b, under my scenario, 256 days to go to state court, exhaust his claims, and then come back into federal court with one fully exhausted petition. rhines would be in the position of prisoner b in my scenario but for the fact that his claims are  are much more complicated. he is serving a  a sentence of death. he did have a long trial. and under that situation, it's simply unfair to someone in rhines' place to have his right to a review of the eight unexhausted claims cut short because he had a complicated case or the district court was slow in getting to a decision.
thank you, your honor. i think that's an important point, justice alito. i mean, in this case, it's exactly what happened. the supervisors took mr. ceballos's assessment seriously. and the difference was, after they further thought about it, they didn't think  they didn't agree with the proper course of action for the district attorney's office, especially since there was a motion pending, "let's let the courts decide that." so, if  where  i think plaintiff's suggesting that, but for protecting speech that's required by the duties of employment, employees really would not have much of a right or a remedy if it turns out that the employer believed that maybe they weren't performing their jobs correctly, or, in our case, if the supervisor had considered the speech and said, "you know what? you made a bad judgment call, and we don't think it's entitled to a promotion," that shouldn't give the plaintiff a constitutional right to challenge that decision. if that  if the  if mr. ceballos was, in fact, doing his job, that was required of his job, and he was doing it competently, his remedy is not the first amendment. his remedy is not even  he doesn't even need a whistle-blower statute for that. he could go through civil service, he could go through a formal grievance procedure, and though  although state statutes on whistle-blowers do vary, there is no state statute, in my understanding, that covers broadly than what the ninth circuit does here 
well, it's been our experience and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners don't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted claims with their exhausted claims. it's typically based on innocent mistake, a simple failure to understand either the particular circuit within which they are housed, a difficulty in understanding that circuit's exhaustion law, difficulty in understanding the prison grievance procedures that they attempted to comply with, and perhaps even being further confused by the fact that prison grievance administrators seem to apply prison grievance regulations, i don't want to say in an ad hoc manner, but inconsistently. and so when they bring these complaints that are mixed they actually are intending to bring a fully exhausted complaint but then after a little built of judicial review, it becomes clear that they didn't exhaust.
if  if 
now, i'd like to also assume 
 the twenty-first 
most 
well, i think that you could follow holbrook pretty closely and that i think what you'd need to  to deal with is there's a whole bunch of precedent regarding how prejudicial shackling is. we know that character is essential in penalty phase, and the other characteristic of penalty phase is the heightened for reliability which is not present in the guilt phase.
it is 
that was a question of what kind of questions go to juries.
wasn't that acknowledged in the district court, in the trial court?
will you quote the language that you're referring to?
they didn't, but i think it would be very odd to attribute to congress the intention on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so that we want to use it and we want you to continue to use it for purposes of the efig program 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i think the court will want to have available to it the red brief and also this big, which is the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the patents in it, and i'm going to quote from both of them. i think you can't understand what motivation means and what the whole test that the federal circuit is employing means 
absolutely.
 bring us to prudential threshold.
let me ask you 
they testified that what they did 6 they asked  they asked the other experts to look into 7 it. and bear in mind, all of the experts in this 9 case had less than the expert in wiggins. all of the 10 experts in this case had less than the expert in williams. 11 what these lawyers gave the expert is a client that they 12 themselves said is not a reliable source of information, a 13 client who did not want to discuss his life history, a 14 client who misled counsel, a client who these lawyers said 15 we can't rely on  on this fellow.
well, they've already said that. i mean, there would be federal jurisdiction there because the federal government would be a party to the case. right?
justice ginsburg, i think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a tucker act problem, this court could reach that issue and send the case back on the tucker act grounds. so maybe i could explain to you why it is that we think that there's not a tucker act problem, at least at this stage of the litigation. the ninth circuit's reasoning on this was a little bit oblique, but as i understand it, there were two parts to it. first of all, that there might be some kind of substantive due process claim here that did not depend on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact that there was some endangerment of these individuals and that gave rise to some substantive due process right. and even if that claim, as the ninth circuit recognized, is not one that is formed on the contract or an implied contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's clearly within the coverage of the totten doctrine because it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the individual will be engaged in a  in a situation where they will be endangered. and i think that was certainly true of william lloyd in the totten case. when he crossed southern lines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on president lincoln. in footnote 3 of our opening brief, we have a quotation from president lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to protect that. so that's why i think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the tucker act and not being required to be brought in the court of claims, but nonetheless a claim that is barred by the totten doctrine. the other point they made was with respect to the specific regulations that the agency has internally, and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was based on the regulations independent of the contract. but in order for that claim to go forward, the court would have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations. and even if the court is right that there's a need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the government to wait to assert a totten defense until there is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually requires discovery because i think what totten recognized is  is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the outset before any discovery because of the nature of the suit. so for those two reasons, we thought that the  that the better view was that the tucker act problem was either not presented because of the substantive due process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the totten act.
 nobody's buying two trucks from two different purchasers.
in other words, the nub of your position, as i understand it, is the public policy that favors relative 
the answer is no. it  it does not qualify if it's removed from navigation. once the vessel is taken out of navigation, as in justice scalia's situation where that vessel is on the land, it is being used as a completely different 
absolutely, justice stevens. and of course, an even position one step intermediary from that or one step backtracking from that would be to say that all congress can do in this area is regulate those ads that are unambiguously election oriented. and, of course, what's the class of those ads? well, that would be express advocacy. and the one thing that i think is clear from this court's decision in mcconnell is this court made clear that express advocacy is not a constitutional line. congress is not disempowered to go after mixed ads that are  yes, they have a component of issue ads, but you bet you they're intended to influence the election. those ads are what are at issue here, and i think in order to be able to regulate those in a way that makes sense, the key is to regulate in a way that's not vague, that's not overbroad, but is not so under-inclusive that it can be easily evaded. and i think buckley shows how hard that is. it's a tall order. in buckley, this court had a provision of feca that prohibited independent expenditures related to a candidate election. the only way the court could save that provision from the vagueness concern was to limit it to express advocacy. but having done that, the court said, well, it's so limited, it's so easy to evade, we're going to find that it fails strict scrutiny. in mcconnell, this court said that in bcra, after careful study, congress had actually found out a way to avoid those three pitfalls. all of the proposed alternatives of  of appellants run headlong into one or more of those obstacles. look at the tests they've proposed. they've proposed looking at 16 factors, 4 details. they disclaim any interest intent, but any of those tests i think would be vague and unworkable. in contrast, they pluck a definition from the irs regs that is designed to deal with 501(c)(3) corporations in a completely different context or a modification of a proposal by bcra's sponsors, and they  and they put those tests out there. and those would be very, very easy to evade in practice. in fact, i think if you use some of the tests that they propose or their amici proposed and you look at the body of ads that were before this court in mcconnell, you'd end up finding that a substantial percentage of them were grassroots lobbying. well, if one thing has to be inconsistent with this court's decision in mcconnell, it's the conclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered by this definition are unconstitutionally regulated because this court clearly rejected a substantial overbreadth claim. the one thing i would say in  in closing is to understand that congress, having sort of avoided these very difficult pitfalls of vagueness, overbreadth, and easy evasion, came up with this definition in title ii. but as this court recognized in mcconnell, title ii of the statute does not stand alone. it is part and parcel of the broader regulatory regime here. and without title ii, title i's limitations on soft money contributions to parties will succeed only in taking that soft money and directing it to corporations that are closely aligned with candidates or with the parties themselves. this statutory as-applied challenge that you have before it  you strikes at the heart of the mcconnell decision and at the heart of bcra's title ii. this court should reject the invitation to revisit the mcconnell decision and should give congress' effort in this area a fair chance at success. thank you.
 you said they haven't paid tax for this  their income  federal income tax either. this seems to be a novel claim, and i don't know of another where failure to pay tax owed to a state or the federal government is the basis for a rico claim.
i think those illustrations are  are the  very much the exception rather than the rule, as this court recognized in 
and that is that when congress amended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that arose from elsewhere. that's what the insertion of the word administrative there was done. it was not done in order to create an exhaustion regime, but rather, to eliminate a preclusion regime. and we set this out quite carefully in our brief, as do the two union amici, as to what the purpose of the grievance procedure is here. it is not to create an exhaustion regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime with what the government, at least, concedes under the statute, as now written, is not a personnel action. that is, the csra is quite comprehensive with regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that are not personnel actions. and as this court's opinion in bush against lucas makes absolutely clear, a warrantless search of the kind to which our client was subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is not within the comprehensive scheme of the csra for dealing with personnel actions. thank you.
well, i  i agree that  that section (h)(8) is different from the incompetency exclusion, for example, which i'll turn to in a minute, in that it does tie the  the findings to the excludability. and that makes the  the harmless error argument that we have on that issue, obviously, more difficult than on the  the incompetency issue. but it's still  i think it ultimately comes down to how you  how you view the error. is the error not trying someone within 70 days, or is the error not recording a finding in the record? and if  if you focus on  on the findings aspect 
that's right. they have a shot at getting paid using this other method.
well, justice ginsburg, i think we would take the position, based on our reading of the oakland cannabis case  and, obviously, different justices on this court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion  i would imagine the federal government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of oakland cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. but i think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the controlled substances act in an injunctive action. and i think, in that context, certainly justice souter is right, that this court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. i think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the respondent's argument, that california law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under california law, is that there's a mismatch between what california law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. because the california law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. and so, if respondents are right on their commerce clause theory, i don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their  that marijuana use is medical. if they're right, then i think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just 
no, i don't think it was, with respect, justice souter. this court found as to the spousal notification critically, that there was a large fraction of the applications of the statute that would give rise to the constitutional problem.
yes. mistake is something that negatives the mens rea requirement of knowledge. so, of course, the government has to prove knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt, and if somebody has mistake, then the government isn't going to be able to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
 we have before us the state allowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the prosecution right after the judge's ruling?
you get rid of them after frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole purpose of which is to keep you out of courts. i'd like to  i'd like to ask you about your argument on section 2, which 
well, i should have thought that regular household chores of  say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic  washing dishes, making bread. and now you say growing marijuana isn't?
no, but 
that was an off-the-cuff remark by a single attorney, your honor, and that can't be taken as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this statute. it also was regarding a provision that is not even directly before the court right now which confers no different shipment privileges than are conferred on any winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would obtain a license to sell in new york.
all right, let's assume it's extremely apparent. isn't  and assume, just for the sake of argument, that we have a simple case, not a complex case, so it's easy to see that, in fact, the evidence falls short. it's still the case that this court has discouraged, or has certainly  has either discouraged the granting of motions at the close of the plaintiff's case, or at the close of all the evidence  in any event, has put its imprimatur on denying those motions, subject to renewal after verdict. how can we possibly find that there is plain error when a court does exactly what we have encouraged them to do in order not to waste a lot of trial time and jury time? how could we ever find there is plain error, except with respect to the renewed motion after the verdict?
 respondents concede in their brief, the only question then is does a parole decision count as a, quote, criminal 
kansas equalizes under any formula, as new mexico did, could do. alaska, you eliminate 22 percent in order for them to just kind of squeak by. if they applied congress's formula they would just equalize. this is an option i contend that's available to every state that wants to take advantage. if you give them a 25 percent disparity allowance, you allow them to back out disequalizing expenditures. there's really no explanation that's been offered why there's any disequalization at all. with that, if there is any time  unless there are any further questions.
your honor, again, deborah morse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the message in light of the subculture of the school where drug use is a serious problem. and it was on the spot judgment. we believe that judgment was reasonable as opposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers, but we know that that was also the judgment of the superintendent and district judge 
well, no, the evidence goes to explain why the defendant is taking the position that he does. he said, "i wasn't there." now, it's true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was  -
your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?
well, what his reason is, this is always the way we did it. that's his reason.
no, not at all, your honor. the medical opinion in those cases is against abortion whatsoever and a refusal to use one's facilities to provide any abortion 
yes, by means of an administrative official action before the fcc.
the district court made two mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. because of that inconsistency, the court of appeals 
no.
no, it does not. it doesn't in so many words refer to the police report, but it refers to  it  it, i think, unambiguously describes the crimes described in the police report and that it involves, as i said, the same date, the same street address, the same victim, and the same arresting officer.
justice stevens, again, you're right.
there is a vast difference, but the question i have is whether congress has any voice in trying to draw the line that divides the two categories.
justice ginsburg, he was inside the house, and he walked outside thereafter.
okay.
mr. schalit, can you give me some reason why i should care a whole lot about this? what's the big deal? i mean, so what if we adopt a very minimal standard. so what. it just means you have a bench conference and the  and the judge asks, you know  you know, you struck three  three blacks. it, you know, looks suspicious to me. i'm not sure it's more likely than not. i'm not sure it's even enough to go to a jury, but it looks suspicious to me. why just  how come you  you struck all three blacks that were in the venire? what is such a big deal about adopting a very  a very low standard?
yes, but in  in this circumstance, the  the striking party's silence is one  when the test is set at the inference level not at the more likely than not level, the  the test is one  i'm sorry  not the test, but the  the silence is one of strategic judgment. let me balance the risk of having the adverse inference drawn against me against the risk of disclosing my trial strategy or my voir dire strategy.
i am not aware of that. so that would be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.
is  is  i didn't mean to cut you off.
agreeing on what the 
which raises an entirely different policy issue?
well, artuz talks about you look to the state's procedural filing requirements. this is a federal statute and properly filed is given a federal meaning, but you presumably look to the state filing requirements, as you did in artuz, to determine what that means. now, all of these concerns about delay and so on are the exact same concerns, where there in artuz someone could file successive petition after successive petition in new york if they want to delay. it's just not  it's not a  it's certainly not a problem for noncapital cases.
your honor, if i understand the question, i  if the question is is it permissible to have 
yes.
is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?
perhaps i 
i think that that  it's fair to say that it's not 100 percent controlled by the postal service, but i wouldn't say that there are a lot of things that are left up in the air or that there's any more that's left up in the air than in the kind of experience that goes on in installing a wiretap. justice 
in 
well, to the extent that you want to address equitable tolling. that's the question, should there be equitable tolling until such time as she's aware of the disparity. but what petitioner's theory does is says even after the employee is aware of the disparity she can wait 15 more years and then sue.
the first amendment would not be the  would not be the source of protection. whether there would be some argument that, if the employee could not be fired, it would be an unconstitutional condition to require him to put his job at peril for committing a due process violation or something like that, whether there would be a claim like that, that would be a different matter. but the first amendment 
i think that's the import of the rutherford decision with laetrile.
well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion. however, even if there  what i'm saying is even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any resulting confusion.
don't you think the evidence that was available without going in the house would have supported all those charges?
suppose the amount were trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this question?
why is it moot? or even on  why does claim preclusion apply? i mean, if you win, from what you've said  somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the state statute of limitations properly violated some federal law, let's say  then that would show that the state statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. would that be sufficient to knock out the federal suit too?
 which is 
yes. they've shown the same official propensity to engage in the conduct that congress was concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.
well, your honor, let  before i go on with the statutory arguments 
 that is 
and so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place. if that's, leaving your side parallelism out of it, i'm past you on that, all right? i'll accept for argument's sake all your point about that. now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of the meetings or give any other clue for meetings etcetera, what's your best authority ? this is an area of law i'm not familiar with. i'm looking for cases that will tell me how specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down to specific ones.
i understand that.
 of any kind, not about any official particular procedure. i'm sorry, justice breyer.
it is far less dangerous, your honor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in the middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution. it can be far more disruptive to allege a violation of constitutional rights as a defense to a criminal prosecution, while that prosecution is in progress, and an effort is made to examine prosecutorial decision-making than in an after-the-fact, after-acquittal civil action for damages, such as we have here. you have already permitted that kind of examination in criminal cases where probable cause is present.
 or demotions.
well, we believe that it has been sufficiently raised below. 1981 does not have any special or enhanced pleading requirements. this is notice 
mr. restuccia, the  we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. it said only when  if this exists, i must, and if that exists, i must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. and i was curious as a matter of what is going on in michigan trial courts now. do judges routinely tell defendants who plead guilty  tell them not only when the court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal? because that 
 what do we do about that particular concession?
the district court heard both of the  both of the sisters regarding the confession. the district court heard hubert muncey, jr. regarding the alleged confession.
isn't that the answer?
well 
it sounds as though that she dispatched them immediately, your honor, because 
any, presumably any other denomination that is not of the established church could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated against, because they're favoring a particular church over them. your proposition is simply that somebody  somebody in oregon can't challenge the fact that they're building a church in florida simply because the person in florida pays taxes, right?
which happens thousands of times in  in all of the courts. it's very common and i don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. it's simply other action pending. end of case.
that's right, justice o'connor, but that's true under the free exercise clause as well. so even the sixth circuit, that obviously had some problems with the statute, understood that on that score there's no more entanglement with religion under rluipa than there is under the free exercise clause itself.
and the reason for that, justice stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish, especially for the judicial system to distinguish, between hard-fought competition and anticompetitive intent if all we're looking at is what's in people's mind set. as judge easterbrook wrote in his aa poultry decision 
as a constitutional matter, they have an immunity from suit, but 
isn't this an artificial distinction in  when you're talking about the making of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time involved. but with, with software, the federal circuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive and fast to copy it that simply sending the information abroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of the golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies overseas.
you can surely answer that, "we agree," or "we don't agree."
your honor, maybe i'm not understanding your example. are you imagining that the state that's offering the homestead exemption was imposing a tax on the property located outside the state?
why won't it?
even though what 
do you think juries can, oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what they are told if they are told, you can take into account conduct directed at other people for the purpose of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?
they're not being paid for this lawsuit.
but i mean, justice ginsburg's point is you  you  even with a  a few properly named defendants, you're going to have the same issue preclusion problem.
yes, and the whole committee said we do not want to take a position on zahn.
 what they said.
the commission addressed that question in its amicus brief in the court of appeals, and took the position that that claim was not in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, because the injury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is  - and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather than fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. and so, we didn't address that in our brief here, obviously, but the commission took the position, below, that that would not be preempted, because it's not in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
she knew, as it was, that they weren't going to do anything. what good would it have done her to know that, oh, it's nice to know that they've gone through a probable cause determination in coming to the conclusion that they're not going to do anything. i mean, what is the social value of that?
 no claim.
once again, that  that cuts both ways. why would they  if the text reads the way you say it reads, why did they have to say is a misdemeanor under federal or state law? because it wouldn't have mattered. the only courts  the only convictions that would be covered would be federal or state convictions. they would not need that  that qualification.
oh 
right.
but in this case, it is going to impede the  the activities we have there. and a good example of this is in the amicus brief at page 25 where alaska does not even assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife. the alaska legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife within the park. this gives you some sense of the type of difficulties that we're going to encounter.
well, one of them does.
it says that if the brecht standard applies, does the petitioner or the state bear the burden? i guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden.
they did. they contained the  perhaps the most key documents, which were the billing records that showed that that trust was actually drafted. the trust, of course, never saw the light of day, but those billing records reflected that. and none of that was in front of the texas probate court. in addition, justice breyer, you mentioned that there were a number of other instances of tortious misconduct that were found by justice carter, in addition to the forging of the  of the irrevocability point. indeed, justice carter found that there were massive transfers of j. howard's assets to pierce marshall in his last days, and those asset transfers were made in exchange for notes that were payable years in the future. this was after j. howard had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a heart attack. annuities were used to pay for those as well. so that he was essentially stripped of all of his assets by the time he was dead. there was  there were no assets in the probate estate at that time. justice ginsburg, i would refer you to appendix page 42 where the  the district court indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary complaint were first filed by pierce marshall in the bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused, several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be filed in a response. mr. brunstad indicated that what happened here was that while the claim was pending in texas, it was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably because there was some dissatisfaction on ms. marshall's part as to how the texas probate court was going. in fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very specifically the fact that the first time that the tortious interference with gift claim was made was in the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim. and i would just conclude by stating that the cause of action that was at issue here was really a very common one. it's the  not in and of itself, but it's common to make a claim against the estate in debt or that a gift was given, and that may, indeed, diminish the estate that is eventually passed. but that doesn't invalidate any of the estate planning documents. it simply means that something that might otherwise have been within the estate was not included in the estate. that's really all that happened here. the claim was for tortious interference with gift. that, indeed, may have diminished the amount or may not have since j. howard was actually quite an active man at the time that he made this  this gift or intended to make the gift, and was still doing business deals. he may have increased his  his assets enormously at that point in time. but in any event, what it certainly does not do is, it does not invalidate an estate plan. it does not invalidate a will, and it certainly didn't invalidate the trust or the will in this case. if there are any further questions, i'd be happy to answer them.
so 
do we have any cases involving a zany property interest having been found by a state? i don't think we have any.
no, but if the jurors' concern is that you either have to acquit them or  we want to make sure he never walks out of prison again, and the only way to do that is to convict him of a capital offense so the judge can impose the death penalty. i don't know why that beck wouldn't be triggered on those facts.
let's get 
judge giles didn't say that  that the state law would never in the future be applied to these defendants. he said at this early time it was still unclear whether it would be applied.
i think in that case also, i would probably be here arguing that maybe if the fcc had determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations they came up with under that scheme, in order for the act to function correctly, that they have to be complied with. i think i would also argue that that was unjust and unreasonable. but this case, if the question is, did the fcc adequately explain what it did here, i think that all of the years of explanation of why something is fair are also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to pay the compensation.
it's people v. berry?
but whether it's collected or not may  indeed, may vary depending on whether state law or federal law applies. and if federal law applies, then you have the jurisdictional consequence.
i don't think that it is that confusing, justice o'connor. this is a statute that was enacted against the backdrop of section 1503 in a well-understood meaning of the word "corruptly." the same word appears in section 1505. when the d.c. circuit concluded that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular case, congress came back with a definition that legislatively overruled the d.c. circuit decision and said "corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose." the "improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice." that definition logically applies to section 1512, because congress enacted the corruptly-persuades provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-tampering in the statute, originally. and some courts concluded that it was no longer punishable under section 1503, either. to fix that situation, congress looked to the model of section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety of acts that are covered that under petitioner's test would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an anticipation that the subpoena was likely. those kinds of acts were considered to be unlawful. similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to an individual to assert the fifth amendment in bad faith, not to protect that individual's own interest, but to obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the time of the enactment of this statute. and congress specifically said, "we want 1512 to be able to pick up the kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer prosecutable under section 1503, and that had not been included in the original version of 1512." so that there is history here that explains how these terms should be applied. and as far as petitioner's contention that the word "corruptly" does nothing and leads to a series of horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and appropriate use of the word "corruptly" solves those problems. petitioners talk about how people should be able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to engage in those conversations. but if an entity has subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that proceeding to invite them to exercise that right. if the agency wants their testimony, it can get it through compulsion. similarly, petitioners argue that document policies are, per se, made unlawful under the government's approach. but as the court of appeals specifically recognized in this case, a sound application of the word "corruptly" would look to whether there is a threat of some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an obligation not to destroy the documents before the proceeding gets started. and, as well, there are intents that are simply not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable. and if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to violate 1512. and a sound use of "corruptly" prevents all of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad. now, petitioner in this case, in addition to attacking the word "corruptly," also has advanced a number of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some connection that had to be required between the defendant's intent in a possible future proceeding. but the reason that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is largely because petitioner, itself, deliberately decided to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the statute, and never asked for what it's asked this court to impose today. it never asked that the defendant must be shown to believe that some particular proceeding was likely to occur in the near future. instead, what it did is say that the defendant had to have an intent to impair an object's availability for use in a particular proceeding. and what the court of appeals said is that if there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error;it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding that was anticipated was an sec investigation of enron. and the other instruction that petitioners asked for in the district court is that the official proceeding must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the future. but that instruction is flatly contrary to the statute.
well, the  the consistent view of the courts of appeals and district courts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar does have some application even when the claims are litigated simultaneously. for example, it's the universal rule among those courts of appeals that have decided the issue that if the plaintiff obtains a judgment against the united states, that that judgment immediately 
 trust them with it.
another one that 
but the strong inference of scienter is not pled on a group basis. it has to be pled with respect to each individual defendant. so it's quite convenient 
justice stevens, and may it please the court: there are five primary reasons why this prosecution is outside the scope of anything congress has authorized. first, the government's interpretation of the wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule. second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by allowing the government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 months for conduct that has never given rise to civil liability in this country. third, this prosecution contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity in matters of international tax enforcement. fourth, the government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this prosecution without disregarding another act of congress, the mandatory victims restitution act, which is, as the name specifies, mandatory. and, fifth, under this court's decisions in mcnally and cleveland, the wire fraud statute applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into relinquishing something that it holds as money or property. a sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax claim is neither money nor property.
but why asano?
it certainly shouldn't be a plausible ground test, and even the petitioner agrees with that position, your honor. and it certainly would work if we adopted, as i think congress did, a system like the one that justice scalia spelled out because then the defendant knows. and i'd like to get back, as i was discussing with justice kennedy, to what the defendant knows. he knows that if he's outside the time that he's guaranteed automatic review, whether direct appeal or state review, state post-conviction review, that his chances of exhausting more claims in state court 
the government disagrees, your honor.
all right. regardless, this is beside the point. i  all right. can i  i just want you at some point to get to not just the constitutional question. maybe he can go in and raise his claim. i don't know if he should have exhausted or not, et cetera.
i think, justice ginsburg, our fundamental point is, there is no counterpart to tort or contract action, with habeas. there is just no analog. and that is because there's not only rule 2, which imposes this heightened across-the-board fact pleading requirement, but it's also because those pleading rules work in tandem with all the other unique habeas rules that apply only to habeas that serve to narrow the timing and scope of habeas review.
that  that's correct.
thank you.
 which is 
i'm sorry, how the 3-year delay happened?
your honor, we have not done that type of  of inventory.
not to my knowledge.
i  i do know of several out there.
i think 
 that the answer is no.
not in this suit.
the police reports and the complaint applications, but the statute 
you say its test is inclusive. i would say its test is meaningless. they have essentially said, our test simply reduces to what, what your opponents in this litigation say. if you think that's being inclusive, you know  it doesn't add anything whatever to  to the  to the question, would a person of the ordinary skill in this field have conceived of this idea.
but it does also turn, your honor, in part on the nature of the interest at issue, and the particular process that the court set up in batson to create an order  order  system of proof and to allow the proper balance to be struck between the importance of peremptory challenges and their use in selecting a fair and unbiased jury and the interest in assuring that there has not been a constitutional violation, much for the same reason that in ristaino we do not inquire on mere possibility. there are countervailing interests. in ristaino there has to be much more than a mere possibility. in batson, the court sought to move away from the difficult-to-establish standard of swain to something that would be more flexible yet still maintain the state's interest in having a peremptory challenge system. your honors, california does not stand alone in its interpretation of this test. as i mentioned earlier, there are very few states that have considered this issue. connecticut, maryland have done what this court said it  they should do, what all courts should do and look at the title vii cases. california has done that. it has not announced a standard that is inconsistent with batson. it has announced a standard that follows from this court's direction in batson. it has required a shifting burden of production which does not occur until there has been either a presumption or a strong mass of evidence, to use wigmore's term.
your honor, i don't know that the fact that  that strict scrutiny might become  what that means, what that's going to require. and arguably, this is a slightly different strict scrutiny than other strict scrutinies because of some of the legislative history, to the extent one  one wants to look at that. and  and that's, i guess, the problem. as we flesh that out, during that entire time, we're saying it's all right to burden other inmates in prisons. it's all right to burden prison officials. it's all right for congress not to burden federal prison officials, but for congress to burden state prison officials with this new set of obligations.
well, i guess i'm not sure that's true. i mean, some of the displays that are out there in courthouses have moses receiving the commandments and have text. and i guess, my point, though, would be, again 
 because there is 
okay. the officer says, "i'm searching to see whether the person has any evidence of crime on him." for example, whether he has any drugs on him. law enforcement purpose: supervisory, i suppose. they want to know whether their  whether their parolees are committing offenses. and yet, that reason would apply to everyone virtually all the time. so, it doesn't seem to be a limitation at all. what  am i  am i missing something?
 this concession 
say the injunction question came up right now, today. could the district court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected every claim of this patent, and i'm going to take that into account in deciding whether to put ebay out of business?
in the common law cause of action, which isn't available in michigan, but under the common law cause of action, all was  all that was determined was that you had a right to possession at the time the lawsuit was filed.
 in that  in that instance, action can be taken against him if he does further violate the law under the terms of probation. the point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or the district court doesn't extend to mexico.
on both their statutory interpretation and the contract?
 bring it up.
a call for a change in the law, i would have supposed, was political speech.
 contrary 
how do you go about determining whether something falls within somebody's job duties? how specifically does that have to be set out?
it was 
could you tell me whether the rate of tax is uniform throughout guam? the rate of real estate tax. is it an island-wide tax or is it local, county?
you do, justice kennedy. and just as this court in the aramco case said that title vii doesn't apply to the foreign  work in a foreign land by an american company of an american 
it's not  it's not  the  the words of the statute that i think are relevant is it  is it  you can't discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. now, the words i just cited are present in 703. so that's the substantive offense. those words, as justice scalia pointed out and others, are missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a broader definition than those words i just cited as to what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination. that's the statutory argument. and then you add, there could be good reason for that. these people typically are at work and there are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so subtle.
 in this case, up to $100 million.
but you're not  you're not 23 insisting on that super diligence because you say, well, 24 in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to 25 undo the state conviction.
in addition 
mr. jones, i looked at the videotape on this. it seemed to me that he created a tremendous risk of drivers on that road. is that an unreasonable way of looking at the  at this tape?
i see your point.
 not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because i see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
i'm not sure i understand your point. i would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit  if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal offenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which carry 
okay, but do you take the position 
no, i understand that. but to the extent people are concerned about disuniformity from the point of view of the federal recovery, the preemption provision is going to apply whether this action is in state court or federal court.
and i don't know, perhaps you don't know, what the implication of a decision say in your favor here would have for vermont's campaign finance law or california's or some other.
 the other side  if you want the argument, the other side is, there are several hundred cases already pending. and, therefore, if we accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the constitutional argument. if we reject your interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be brought. but, of course, "new ones won't" might. and, therefore, what is your answer to 
what was the  what court had granted the stay?
no. they specifically 
i think that's exactly the problem. that was the problem we faced when the california supreme court did not decide our federal claims. i think because they only decided our state claims, we were not able to seek certiorari on the merits from the state supreme court decision, and then i think the procedure contemplated by this court in williamson county was that you could return to federal court with your federal claim once the state compensation claim 
oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at  he's at risk of a contempt citation.
or, in  in other words, your  your targeted argument doesn't really make sense unless there is a family vendetta. i mean, i  i want to make money. i don't care 
i  i guess i'm  i'm not clear about the facts here. did  did the court  did the court comply with (b)? did it shorten or extend the time? was there any issuance of a  of a  of an order shortening or extending the time, or did the court just ignore the deadline and  and act later?
 what they did.
never happened before, and it's contrary to the  what congress wants. in a different statutory context, it was what congress wanted for uniformity.
 to obey an order 
that's correct.
well, he filed his federal habeas petition pro se. the counsel was appointed shortly afterwards, yes, your honor.
no, your honor, because i think what some officers will do is exactly what officer good did in this case, which is shout police and then burst in immediately. so they'll do the announce part, which protects the police, to some extent, from being shot, but they will skip the rest of the knock and announce requirement, which is to wait some reasonable amount of time to allow the householder to make himself more dignified, to get to the door, to answer the door, to admit the police in a dignified manner. you raise the point that lots of innocent people are subject to search warrants. thousands of cases every year of  of people who didn't do anything either 
thank you, mr. chief justice. justice ginsburg, let me  let me try to justify having this issue before the court. first of all, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you suggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what you're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related to the challenged order. and in this case we not only raised the rico issue, but we also raise state law issues in the  in the eleventh circuit which were not within the specific grant and were entertained by the eleventh circuit because that's the standard. and then once you get past that, justice kennedy is absolutely right. the issue is whether there's an order to be reviewed. there is no final judgment rule on claims coming out of the federal courts of appeals, and therefore, it's  it's absolutely fair game. and the issue is i  i submit, fairly subsumed within the question presented. justice souter, you know, with respect to the id cards, i think it's very important to recognize that for us to do our business, we have to have an id card in order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the immigration laws. so that  you know, those id cards add nothing to the  to the conduct of our business. and, you know, mr. stewart just suggested that, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that h.j. allows some a  a different analysis of this particular point. but h.j. preceded reves. this court held in reves that you have to distinguish between the activities of the enterprise and the activities of the defendant and  and they've never made any effort to do that. all they do is suggest we've engaged in wrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in wrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy. there's nothing in there that remotely suggests that there is an existing enterprise. with respect to the question of how to interpret this particular statute, justice scalia is absolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is at most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an ambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the rule of lenity. i didn't hear any adequate answer to justice kennedy's specific question about why do they use person in the subsection just ahead of it, if they really meant to embrace everything here. and it's no answer to say, well, enterprise is a term that could be  that has a general background. enterprise is the linchpin of this statute. the notion that congress didn't mean to very specifically and explicitly define enterprise here is absurd. of course, it defined it, and it provided a very specific and detailed definition. and it's not free for the government or for anyone else then to come here and shunt aside that definition and say, well, we're just going to deal with background principles. the truth is they're trying to write out of it groups of individuals acting in association. that language is there. it was put there for a reason. the government concedes that it didn't  that it never  that congress never had this issue in mind. how it can be then that this is not at least sufficiently ambiguous that you should construe it in our favor strikes me as  as very difficult to understand. and finally, i don't  i've never heard the expression rico-ize before, justice breyer, but i  i embrace it wholeheartedly because that is precisely what we're talking about here. these are enormous penalties that are imposed, and it's a statute that this court has recognized in the past, even on its own terms, is very broad. certainly there is no reason to take those terms and rico-ize the  the breadth of corporate activity that the plaintiffs' complaint in this case would  would allow. the court should reverse the decision below and dismiss this complaint, just as the seventh circuit did. if there are no further questions, thank you, your honors.
no, i guess i don't. and maybe i'm missing something. but i think that  you know, the dual school system predated the court ordered decree, which is part of where we have gotten to with resides schools and the like. if i can come back to the facts of this case, i think it's important to recognize that he was denied transfer to bloom, even though there were empty seats available at bloom school. so if he had been an african-american, he would have been allowed to transfer to bloom. instead, he was prevented. and there was an empty seat sitting there in that school. and that's why i think this case does prevent a very stark racial quota.
we have done a number of things. in 2000, the attorney general put together a task force that included consular officials, law enforcement officials, jail managers and, working together, devised some better education tools so that  that there could be more education in terms of the  the competent authorities who need to provide this information.
well, but this gives you the advantage of coming in in advance saying, i want  i  i want a ruling in advance that i'm not going to violate the injunction. you've got a cheap lawsuit.
if it's not just a close call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.
and that's the focus of your argument 
 not to follow section 3.
it seems to me unduly intrusive for the courts to tell the president that it cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have certain talents that the government may use to make sure that all of their energies are used properly by the federal government. it's almost like a speech rationale. and perhaps you would say that's just a judgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's a standing concern here, too, that we would be supervising the white house and what it can say, what it can  who it can talk to. and it seems to me that's quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing purposes. i'm not sure that this makes a standard that distinguishes the case from flast or brings it within those  within those cases.
yes, that's correct.
i worry about the general proposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one narrow exception is not a  doesn't contravene a compelling state interest. what about  i assume there is still a federal law against bigamy that applies in federal territories. now, what if, you know, a small religious group comes forward and said, you know, "we  our religion requires bigamy. there are not a whole lot of us. we're just a little tiny group. so, we demand, under rfra, an exemption from this absolute law. why does it have to be absolute? it's just a little tiny exception, only a few of us."
well, my question is the same as justice breyer's. is there anything in the literature, including medical literature, that talks about significant or minor risks? i mean, you fill out forms when you go to the dentist about risks. now, if  if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that significant? i mean, i don't know.
well, your honor, i would say that the starting point was that plan. the board has modified it considerably since then to make assignments more stable and predictable, to make the use of race more narrowly tailored. it is in concept the same plan, because it has some of the features, but the board has added many features that that plan did not have. the 1975 desegregation decree was really quite a blunt instrument and that's why it was so controversial in the community. that's why there was massive white flight. this plan, this board has very wisely modified that plan to make it much more acceptable to the community so that we stopped the white flight. we stabilized our enrollment. we have a community now that very broadly, the public opinion surveys show, that supports racial integration whereas in 1975, they were opposed to it, sometimes violently. this is as i said at the outset a success story.
yes, your honor.
may i 
yes, your honor. it 
there's something called the california coastal national monument. that extends the entire length of california and goes out 12 miles to sea. in that monument, the  the lands, the submerged lands, are both state-owned and federal-owned, and they are managed cooperatively. and that's what we are seeking to do here. and importantly, the fact 
why is that? i mean 
there's 8(c), and there's 12(b), but there's also 15.
 i think i would go far in agreeing with you if the  if the instruction had been "merely to impede" or "merely to undermine." now, i guess that gets to a question i wanted somebody to answer, and you can probably do it. did the  did the court, in giving the instructions, ever refer  in defining the term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities, separately, or did it do it simply as "subvert, undermine, or"  what was the third?  impede"?
 he can 
other than eligibility for punitive damages.
if you look at respondents' brief in their arguments to this court, they first state, page 18, that in fact traditionally they've looked at hydrological connection. second, they 
in  in part it was mandated by the statute.
we have a real problem in vermont. we haven't had a governor go to prison. we haven't had legislators tearfully apologizing for having taken bribes, facing an indictment the next day. but we have got a problem in vermont. in over 65 hearings before our legislature and then through a 10-day trial, we established that as the trial court said, the threat of corruption in vermont is far from illusory.
but the 
no, but the opinion of judge suhrheinrich  i forget his name  explains in great detail why he thought they needed more time before the mandate issued. i don't know why that isn't explaining why he extended the mandate.
you could not, and the idea was this was getting too close to the kroger problem 
may i reserve the rest of my time?
i'm not sure what you mean in that  i'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student loans. there 
yes, but the 
justice scalia, we argue simply that it's fair to shift the burden to the defendant. remember, this is a narrow presumption. it's not a per se invalidity rule. it's just a rebuttable presumption.
and i think that all those things are factors that the court can consider in deciding whether blake voluntarily initiated the contact.
yes. it is the application for state review which comes before this court. we're asking you to review the lower court's rulings on the application.
it alleges that there was an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a plaintiff's burden in the complaint.
but that  that's to the  to the allegation of fraud, but not causation.
but there is the possibility of a case happening, as it happened in the in re bridgestone case, which was a seventh circuit case. in that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens and the  i believe it dealt with the country of mexico. the parties had obtained a ruling in mexico saying that the mexican courts were not to take jurisdiction of the case. under those circumstances the court was required to take back the case because it no longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate the dispute. so i think that's the one example of the case that you raise.
okay. he named x, and now  -
the other is in 2244 which i think is worded exactly the same as this is. the third is i think 2264, which i  i just would have to look at the specific wording of each of those. but i think the  you know, and this 
not to my knowledge, your honor.
well, our two standards, i believe, are relatively close. we both focus on the objective reasonableness of the removal. now, the solicitor general, i believe, is a little bit less  - leaves a little bit less discretion to the district court than we would. we believe that congress, in using the word "may," in using, if you wanted to look at this as a fee-shifting statute, the word "just," meant to leave district courts with considerable range of discretion to deal with cases that come up that are unusual in the way a party can "game the system," if you will, in respect to removal. for example, in this case, waiting as long as the plaintiff did before seeking a remand. obviously a plaintiff 
i understand that, but i'm just  i'm just saying, if you could give me an explanation, a characterization, a description, a statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale claims, i think you'd have a stronger case. but it seems to me just like a stale-claims statute, so i go back and look for other limitations period, and i find it in 1091(a).
now, a minute 
it was 
don't some states such as oregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive damages recovered to the state so they don't even go to the taxpayer? but is the taxpayer saddled with that too?
wunsler died at about 28, didn't he?
well, your honor, the other thing i think about this  this argument about that we have this  this need to have a legislative plan is you invite an abuse of a different kind. if you  if you say to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at the time when you have an undisputed constitutional obligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of  of the decade, as long  and you'll know that what that will do is it will give you the right to come along anytime you feel like it when you get your political ducks 
to trigger something in the  in the canine brain.
well, i would argue that in those cases, it is a supervisory power case. and so to that extent, it's not applicable to this particular case. i'll reserve.
does the record tell us how big he was?
no, your honor. in fact, what i would say is that the thing to focus on is what congress actually enacted and it makes clear that all the litigation proceeds 
then if that's the rule, the school can make any rule that it wants on any subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive under tinker.
we believe we had three claims, the health exception, the medical emergency exception for health threatening emergencies. the death exception we believe is also inadequate and the confidentiality. in addition, the procedures that the court issued  the new hampshire supreme court approved raise an additional problem as well. so there are claims in addition to the health threatening emergency. if there are no further questions from the court. thank you.
yes, i  that's true. and in terms of the olc letter, we offered to lodge it in our brief. unfortunately, by the court's rules, we're not allowed to lodge it, unless the court specifically requests it. and so, that's why it's not there. but we will get that to you, or the government will get it to you, as soon as possible. the actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in the administrative record. and it turns out that we haven't been able to find it, and the government hasn't been able to find it. and so, it's a letter. it's a official demand letter, but it is a letter, and that  the order to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings. and again, what opens the proceedings in  the justice department regulations and other regulations 
well 
yes, your honor. and that is what the majority of the medicaid recipients in our state choose to do. they prefer to pursue the action on their own and in the end just reimburse the medicaid program.
if they get ifp status, all that means  well, first of all, they only get to do that three times. or to have three actions dismissed before they lose their ip status.
well if he is, if he is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be selling some to the other, the other processor even if that processor is not bidding as much?
so it's not correct it's just for one house. it's  what i have is the joint explanatory committee, and it says the managers, on the part of the house and the senate.
i think what  what we said in our brief was that the word respectively is  is in there so that you are not talking about all the banks, but talking about each bank.
well, as i said, i think the  i do think that the proper standard should be the city of boerne standard of congruence and proportionality, exercised with the kind of deference that this court said in boerne, which i think this court adopted in lane, to the factfinding capabilities of the  of the  of the congress.
if they're just simply borrowing it, and don't feel compelled to borrow it, and are, indeed, applying it to private persons who perform safety inspections, then the united states could potentially be liable under the federal tort claims act. as i mentioned here, though, that is definitely not this case, because 
but your argument seems 
counsel, if you  on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, i take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?
because going through the statute and the increase based on credit, and then the notice will give them the opportunity to check. since the consumer here is the  it's a system of checks and balances, and unless you give this consumer the opportunity to check that they are in fact using the correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't driven down by identity theft, you can continue to charge people more 
 be a restriction.
if it isn't a core matter, then in any event the district court here held that there was no preclusion, and it held it for a number of reasons.
it is and i agree with you, justice stevens. it is an unusual case. but the  the critical element here is that the master was looking for an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.
then, basically, you're making the argument from the uniformity phrase  uniform bankruptcy laws. that's essentially your argument. and you're saying, in the  in this case, that that trumps the sovereign immunity, and that gets you out of seminole tribe.
i thought the first time it was raised was on direct appeal by appellate counsel.
if this decision is 
mr. minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?
your honor, i would recognize that there is different language that congress could have  have chosen to state this in a different way, but  and you're right, that in section 3731(d), congress did specifically reference section 3730(a) and 3730(b), but congress did not use that precision in drafting throughout the federal false claims act. just  there are a number of ambiguities that exist throughout the federal false claims act. congress even referred to the general accounting office as the government accounting office.
the single message is, "join the army," that is correct. and the government is promoting only that one message. but this 
there  the point that the court relied on in concluding that automatic reversal was appropriate for denial of the right to self-representation included the critical fact that this is not a right that proceeds in connection with the fairness of the trial. its  its sole existence is 
yes. and, unfortunately, there's  there are several of them that are still being litigated. i've done research on this issue, and, as of this date, i can't give you an actual  an absolute number, but i believe there is approximately 15 cases pending, like this one, that involve the factor (k) instruction  this factor (k) instruction  that involve evidence of  somehow, future-looking evidence, which  all character evidence, frankly, is future-looking 
 this elementary 
yes, although if the title is set aside, ms. flowers will receive a full refund of all the money that she's paid, and that's under the arkansas statutory scheme.
well, justice souter, you may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it was clear there was stigma going on, but you have extended it in croson and in adarand across the board. and i have to say 
i am entirely certain of that, and in fact, the  the local ordinance  i mean, the question of what is final agency action is surely a federal question, but 
you think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless  you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed? you think that's what it means?
that's correct, justice scalia. (d)(2)(d) sets forth the endpoint of a stay entered pending a petition for certiorari in this court. that is not the only reason a court of appeals may stay or delay issuance of its mandate. in fact, if you look at other sections of the rule, (d)(1) affirmatively sets forth a separate basis for staying issuance of the mandate if there is a petition for rehearing filed. and the mere fact that you could have competing stays in a case we think illustrates the incorrectness of the state's view that (d)(2)(d) eclipses everything else and requires issuance of the mandate under all circumstances. the ultimate power at issue in this case is rule 41(b) which gives the court the power to shorten or extend the time for which to issue its mandate. as we've set forth in the brief, there are all kinds of reasons why a court of appeals may occasionally continue to do that beyond the denial of certiorari review by this court.
if there had just been the vertical agreements and if they had been fully disclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would there? if there had just been publicly disclosed agreement by one underwriter with the purchasers to engage in these activities, there would be no violation, would there?
they do, for enforcement purposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.
now, i take it that the basic rule that we've followed  and this is what people are arguing about  could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court.
am i correct 
well, we relied, your honor, on all of  many, many cases in court interpreting that provision and others under the law of nature doctrine 
no. no. 23 of them would protect all ira's. 6 would protect all ira's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an ira as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all ira's up to a dollar amount. in nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 states use, as their state exemption law, an ira that  a statute that has exactly the same language as the federal statute. 6 of those state statutes have been interpreted by federal courts to protect ira's.
that's right because during that time, the state court is deciding on timeliness, and if it's untimely, it was untimely as of the point of filing. that's what makes it a filing requirement. you take your claim and you file it 
no, because this court unanimously foreclosed that argument in richards v. wisconsin by holding that there must be a particularized showing for the particular case. that particularized showing i will gladly concede will be easier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in a  in a stolen property case. but it wasn't made in this case, and this case comes to this court on the posture that the prosecution has conceded, at every step of the way, that that particularized showing was not made here and that, therefore, there was a knock and announce violation.
you said you had  you said you had  your first preference would be 
well, your honor, actually the article 36 is  is unique and different in that the revolutionary part of this is that the detainee did, for the first time, have the authority to have the consulate notified. typically most of the notification statutes, bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties require mandatory notification, but this is an instance where the detainee gets to control. the detainee decides whether or not the consulate is going to be contacted.
but in this case, this case has none of those features.
i mean, that's understandable, isn't it?
 make any difference?
your honor, the  the danger of that is that allowing this, as  as i termed it, a general right of arrest with  with no articulated basis at any point up until charging runs contrary to some of the basic principles 
but i thought you had assumed that, under the arizona law, you could rely on the good samaritan doctrine 
do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the  the case was argued  would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved, they should make a  they could make a  a finding on that?
no. but i'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.
what does  what does material mean?
but what rogers saying in whole or in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation standard existing in missouri. and missouri's proximate cause standard talked about sole causation. and this official court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation can not be the right standard for proximate cause. the court was not asked to decide, and i don't think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door, or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury instruction that calls for proximate causation to be given to both parties  i'm sorry.
maybe you could raise the podium.
the experience of prison officials is that, yes, it is, and  and actually it's very common in prison systems to distinguish, for example, between hardback books and paperbacks. yes, it's  these are difficult lines to draw, and that's where the professional expertise of the people who deal with the problems every day comes into play.
justice o'connor, our position is that congress has not spoken to the question, and so there is no congressional statute that is on point.
 a price discrimination 
may i ask a question? i never had one of these problems when i was in practice, so it's all new to me. but, "an order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred as a result of the removal," does that mean that if, after the removal there are substantial proceedings in the trial court, in an appeal, and so on, and then you suddenly discover that the  there was a mistake and you remand  you can get fees for all the litigation work that took place in the interim? it could be a very large sum of money, couldn't it? it's not just fees incident to the fight over whether removal was proper.
it's pretty hard to read those pages as if they were anything other than what they seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry about the speedy trial act because he thought that it had been waived.
and every now and then they let the water come out. isn't that a discharge?
i don't think that would be a problem under the establishment clause because it's minimal 
did  did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?
well, bivens as a constitutional tort is not a new remedy. the question really is whether there is any conceivable basis when they trash his lodge, when they do all of the other things, for treating this differently from another kind of constitutional violation. i mean, they argue that it's very important, even though we could have lots of people bringing unjustified suits, to have a bivens remedy for retaliation against free speech. the reason that they give is that free speech is easily chilled. but with property rights the just compensation clause is kind of its own antifreeze.
in these  in these two cases  one you have on federal habeas, one you had on direct appeal  individuals are seeking to affirmatively invoke rights that they claim that they can enforce under the vienna convention, and we don't think that the vienna convention confers those individual rights. if  if i could try to explain the  the  what you referred to as a metaphysical question earlier. we agree that the vienna convention, as a self-executing treaty, is part of our federal law.
yes, they do, your honor. as i pointed out, bureau of prisons being one. as a matter of fact, the u.s. department of justice's national corrections institute statistics  and this is not a part of the record  indicate that 96 percent of all states separate prisoners based on disruptive group or gang orientation. so california is not alone in that. it's a  it's done to prevent violence to other prisoners. in sum, turner is the only test that provides the flexibility that prison officials need to safely manage their prisons and protect inmates from harm. the court should apply it here and affirm the lower court. thank you.
let me just ask one more question, mr. shapiro. supposing there had been full disclosure here. do you think there would be an antitrust violation?
justice scalia 
your honor, averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years, which is when the farmers in kansas, who are the beneficiaries that kansas intended to benefit  and both parties realize that. they need this water 
you don't have to be explicit to make it plain. it's a great way to do it, but that's  it's not the only way.
 he will have his parole revoked 
what do you 
yes, but that's a very generalized argument, and what he won on was a very specific point that, that this instruction in effect required, if they were going to give mitigating effect, required a jury nullification. that's a very specific point.
but that's what happened and you're here defending that judgment.
typically they are 
 it's there in the statute.
well, a number of those states have, in fact, joined new york and michigan in asking the court not to 
where is that in the record?
for, among other reasons, your honor  this is what i was trying to  trying to state because this court in casey, dealing with this exact same language, said the following. it said where the statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous, attorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practices  again, this court in casey tracked through the  the usage, the history of the usage of this language and the way courts had responded to this over time  that when that's the case, we do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process. we think that holding in casey is equally applicable here 
i do not know whether they were actually sued. there are  their  i do believe their liability, though, is that workers' comp is an exclusive remedy here. and, although it's not in the record in this case, the state of arizona was also sued, and, according to news reports, settled for substantial sums with both of the respondents. if there are no further questions at this time, i would like to reserve my time.
and suppose neither of those are  are so.
yes, justice scalia. respondent has relied heavily on two early applicability determinations.
i don't 
no. there are many instances in which race needs to be considered on a day-to-day basis in prison. for instance, when the prisoners line up to go to the exercise yard, if 10 white prisoners line up first and the 11th prisoner in line is an african american, it would be extraordinarily ill-advised to release those prisoners in the manner in which they have lined up to go to yard. it would require some reshuffling and maybe even some shifting of prisoners from yard to yard based on their race because to do that would put the minority member at extreme risk. turner is the appropriate test here because courts 
well, i  with respect, i don't think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but i will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a limitations period, because a limitations period is one that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be waived. this provision, where it says, "this act does not apply" 
yes. okay. i have, and i can. since 1974, when this court decided matlock, the federal and state courts, combined, have considered this question. and so, there was a finding of evidence, and it led to a suppression hearing. that's the best that i can do. fifteen times, all the federal and state courts, once every two years. it is the case that in that  in  last year alone, there were 200,000 domestic disputes that were reported. but that's just the city of chicago. what we're considering here is the situation in which there is no real need for the police to 
you mentioned the 
no, but, i mean, why 
 why it wasn't the vessel that counts. if it's a vessel and it is in fact the place where he was injured and it was moving, it  that would be an easy case, but somehow you have to deal with the super scoop, and i'm wondering why.
how  how could one not 12 discover the vacatur? here's my problem. i  i frankly don't think 14 the text of  of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably 15 with either your interpretation or the government's. it 16 says the date on which the facts supporting the claim 17 could have been discovered through the exercise of 18 diligence. well, as you point out in your brief, the fact 20 supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the 21 prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction. 22 that's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which 23 led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. so that makes 24 the government's case a little uncomfortable. but it seems to me you have to acknowledge that 1 your case is pretty uncomfortable when you  when you 2 talk about discovering the fact of the  of the vacatur. 3 i mean, it's a matter of public record. how does one 4 discover a  a public record? how  how could you need 5 due diligence to discover a public record? i mean, it 6 seems to me it's  it's automatically  isn't the 7 vacatur always served on the  on the person whose 8 conviction is vacated? isn't it always that person who 9 seeks the vacation? so what sense does it make to talk 10 about his discovering that particular fact? it seems to 11 me it makes no sense. so you're left with  with two competing 13 interpretations, both of which have some textual problems. 14 i'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense, 15 given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the 16 statute, as justice o'connor has suggested, is to make 17 people bring up their claims promptly. and  and that 18 purpose would  would be served by the government's rule 19 and not by yours. you say unless the state has some 20 statute of limitation, this  this federal requirement of 21 due diligence goes begging. what's  what's your response to that? you 23 really think  especially about the discover.
because it is inconsistent with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive effect to remand a case on the ground that the sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate their immune status in state court. that is precisely why congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.
 act.
isn't that the classic situation in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?
we'd  we would ask for production of documents reflecting their thinking process about entering into one another's territories. and that would be very enlightening. and after we get those documents we would have a much clearer idea and be able to share with the court a much clearer idea of the entire picture of a kind that we can't have at the 12(b)(6) stage. thank you.
of course not, justice ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the  we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a  a threat. that was 
no, but it did in the armstrong 
we believe that would not be a voluntary act. certainly the defendant makes that decision.
this was 
unfortunately, there's too much evidence, there's too much water under the bridge, that shows that public employees who deliver bad news, and are the unwelcome messenger, do face retaliation in their workplaces. and here, ceballos told his workplace, his supervisors, that police misconduct had occurred, and that was an unwelcome message, and he was retaliated against for that reason.
 he didn't say it, that i've made every effort to get from you the place where  that this  where the defense counsel says, "jury, i agree, you cannot put this into factor (k)."
which one?
well, the  the rule that you could apply that would not have per se rules and would ferret out any kind of  of trivial matters would be the eeoc standard with a de minimis rule.
what about the factors that i mentioned? would they be relevant to a factfinder's determining what a reasonable person in that situation  with the two police officers appearing, with the charges not being presented immediately, not being presented at the time the miranda warnings were given, but only after  would those be  would those be relevant factors to decide if this was a voluntary initiated request to talk to the police?
and you're absolutely right, your honor, and that was the lines that were drawn in prima paint. that  that was the  the real issue that was presented. they said there was no contract. they said i'm bringing a rescission suit. and if you read what justice black said in dissent in prima paint, he said there was no contract. and this kind of goes back to what justice ginsburg was saying, that to talk about the implications, the severability implications, of particular challenges under state law misses the point that the federal severability rule doesn't depend on state law.
 and affirmed 
i'm speaking hypothetically, justice ginsburg. my point is that the label the district court attached here was the wrong label, and that's why the court of appeals to satisfy 
now, they're the obstacle to unanimity. so the keys are in their own pocket if they want mr. smith. that's your view.
no, that's not the position, and  and i  and i apologize if i gave that impression in answering justice stevens' hypothetical. i understood to be the hypothetical that you had a government employee who engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that  for that particular endeavor.
but 
if we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another? official
 that argument.
 under 924(c)(1), this court  this court, in the gonzales case, said that it  that it has to be a federal crime, but not because of the 
i think, if i needed to  i mean, we  we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race coding of the cards in the pre-batson era, the disparate questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script, all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge but if we didn't have that, justice kennedy, i would be here arguing that if i could show a single strike that was made for the purpose of eliminating african americans from being considered for jury service, that that ought to come within this court's proscription of batson. now, we haven't made that freestanding claim because i don't think we need that freestanding claim. the jury shuffle is a practice that exists only in the state of texas and, to my understanding, has ever existed only in the state of texas. so it's a  it's a very peculiar phenomenon, but i think i could make the argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these six  let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no african americans came up. there simply were no african americans out of the 108 who were questioned. it seems to me that that in and of itself would violate at least a generous reading of batson.
so, are those  are those entries of the federal government into the regulation of drinking age, are they unconstitutional 
your honor, there was a  it's unclear why he had them go first. there was some state regulation  then in effect, no longer in effect  that suggested that perhaps the state had some initial burden in that case. we're not necessarily asking that the  that the  that the state be required to go first. what we are asking is that the state  excuse me, not the state  the local school system bear the burden of persuasion. and there are three 
i thought the 
not other volvo dealers.
so you  you have picked one way to do that. you say go through the grievance procedure. if there's a constitutional question remaining, if you haven't been satisfied, then you bring the action in court. another way to say is, well, as long as we're making this up, why not allow the  the action to proceed at once in court, but then the court to say, i'm going to abstain while you go through the grievance procedure.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: in united states against riverside bayview homes, this court unanimously upheld the corps' jurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves navigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within the corps' jurisdiction. the principal difference between the rapanos wetlands and the wetlands at issue in riverside bayview are that the rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non-navigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in riverside bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek.
i still don't see the answer to my question, which had two parts. as to the language, (a) which is what's cross-referenced, refers to military commission order number 1, august 31, 2005, or any successor military order. the order, as i understand it, that's created the commission by the president, is an order which was november 13, 2001, not a successor to 2005. but leaving the language aside, what i'm mostly interested in, because i think your interpretation inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim that it is not constitutional for congress, without suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a significant number of cases, even one?
the carrier.
so he gets 
well, i think this court has said 22 that you can draw that line because  and you have to 23 draw that line because in this situation  because in 24 every situation, every capital situation, the evidence 25 that necessarily has to be discussed as part of sentencing 1 can be 
and in neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence. the same argument applies in neder.
mr. chief justice and may it please the court: the court of appeals struck down new hampshire's parental notification act on its face based upon a potential application of the act that even respondents concede may only arise in the smallest fraction of cases. in doing so, the act was rendered ineffective in the overwhelming number of applications where it is unquestionably constitutional, and state officials were denied the opportunity to imply  apply and enforce new hampshire's act within constitutional limits. new hampshire's act can be applied in a manner to protect a minor's health if the rare case arises where a medical emergency occurs that requires an immediate abortion. in that rare case, if it does arise, where an abortion has to be performed immediately and the child does not want to notify a parent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism available which requires new hampshire courts to act promptly and without delay and in the best interests of the minor.
i don't see how you can do 6 both, in other words.
no, that's right. the usual chevron limitations apply. and in your question, justice breyer, you added to the usual chevron limitations that the fcc has to focus on 
excuse me?
after the national banking act, your honor, there are actually very few usury cases left. if you look at the six cases they cite that are all  they say they're federal. there are six federal court of appeals decisions that support them. four of those are payday lending cases decided since 2000. the principal economic effect of this case actually is going to involve the payday lending industry. and was it irrational for the state of florida to say that it's loan-sharking to charge people up to 1300 percent interest? we think that that  whether  whether florida made a good decision or not with its usury laws, usury laws just don't apply to many cases.
there was no other evidence presented to the magistrate or that could have been presented to the magistrate other than the confession to show 
and out-of-state or abroad 
it's more a question of  of whether or not the  there's been a violation of title vii. it seems to me that the number of employee issue is whether you're covered at all, whether you have to conform your conduct to that law. your question  your  your case of whether someone has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's been a violation.
neither, is the answer.
maybe you might be right, maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? how is it not ambiguous? it might cover  it might cover the fees of consultants. it might be that the argument you made is right, but it also mightn't.
well, i don't think, i mean, they've challenged everything including every application of the statute and they've tried to pick off some particular conditions. what i'm imagining is in the future you might have, you might have additional evidence, you might have additional experience with doctors, and they might come in and target their challenge to particular conditions and try to say 
i think that's correct, mr. chief justice. the williamson county case says that you have to go to state court and use the state procedures available for state compensation. you cannot do that without going through the appellate procedure provided by the state courts 
no, but there  there is evidence from which the jury could find that it was a real gun, and in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that is competent evidence for the jury to use in concluding that it would function like a real gun. it's not  they didn't have to put in further technical evidence. an issue might have been raised. i mean, your  the  the defendant might have come up and  and presented evidence to the effect that it was only a starter pistol, in which case, okay, there would be a real issue. but in the absence of any reason to doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be, there would be no reason to  there would be no requirement of further evidence about functionality, would there be?
well, i had the same comment or the same reaction as justice ginsburg. forget about the habeas area. just in  with general civil judgments, have there been law review articles saying that rule 60(b) undermines finality? people kept going back, back, and back. i  i thought quite the opposite, that we were living very well with rule 60(b).
well, from the county's point of view, i'm asking who pays at the end of the line. and it seems, in the oneida cases, it's the state. is it different here? and what taxes are we talking about precisely?
my solution, your honor, has two parts but leads to the same conclusion. our solution is that in applying the act, which is the question here, does the act apply to ms. coke's employment, this court should apply the definitional regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation for two reasons. one, it is the regulation, which no one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the department's law making function. the department expressly defined and delimited its term "domestic service employment" in 552.3 and expressly said it was not doing so in the third-party regulation. so it's entitled to greater deference for that reason. but moreover 
there are authorities that we've cited where courts have rejected the notion that article 36 creates individually enforceable rights, in canada and australia, and there's a case in germany where they refused to provide for a suppression remedy. so there are authorities going the other way. the manner in which this treaty is implemented by the state department overseas and by the state department here is to provide for enforcement through the traditional means. this court, as long back as the head money cases, said that the traditional  treaties are compacts between states. the traditional means of enforcing those obligations is through diplomatic repercussions.
i think that in grutter and gratz, this court rejected the absolute and instead described discretely, which we feel we need, and which is why we are not urging an absolute position. we say that we indeed comply with the requirements of narrow tailoring, and that the plan therefore should be upheld.
but bankruptcy judges do that, justice ginsburg. they decide only the nondischargeability aspect of claims rather than the claims themselves.
well, in that case, he may very well have a valid eighth amendment claim. but our principal submission 
well, the union 
no, it couldn't, and the washington decision that i've cited to you will help you with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under blakely itself, there has to be something above and beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes themselves. it can't simply be  i'm sorry. it can't simply be that there were three crimes committed and all three of them are very serious. it has to be something about the crime, the additional crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary commission of that crime.
mr. shanmugam, could  could i get you back to  to your, your assertion of we don't have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as, as at the pleading stage? it seems to me a seventh amendment claim has been raised. it's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. if indeed the two standards are the same, there's certainly no seventh amendment problem. so why don't we have to first of all decide, in resolving the seventh amendment claim, whether the two standards are the same?
justice stevens, if, by "his or her," it's referencing "any private party," i would agree with that. that would be a different case in 
i would certainly think that if  if there were no question of csra preclusion, if we were just looking at the apa standing alone, and an individual said they've done this unconstitutional thing to me time after time, my supervisor has ransacked my office time and again or fbi agents have shown up at my door every day and have insisted on searching, i think even if damages were unavailable for the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent that a right of action should be available in court. and  but again, i think all of these are perhaps potential alternative bases on which this complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn't alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was the failure to invoke the grievance procedures available under the csra and the collective bargaining agreement. and i think it's not simply a  to say that it's simply a question of when the individual can file suit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures won't work. and there's no reason to assume that that will happen. that is, congress manifested  congress in the csra enacted congressional findings to the effect that collective bargaining and  and union activity in the public sector are in the public interest. it specifically required that collective bargaining agreements under the csra should contain grievance procedures for the resolution of disputes, and i think 
 you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.
may i interrupt? because i'm just not following one part of your argument. are you saying that the pennsylvania analysis, the ad hoc analysis, was not made in the state court?
so we  how enforced? i mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you do that legally not equitably.
have there been cases where in the context of the prosecution, there's been a motion to dismiss the prosecution because it was brought in retaliation for the exercise of the first amendment right?
exactly. it  the whole point is deterrence. and so you wouldn't deter the officers who illegally broke into my house by excluding the evidence from my office if  if  it may even well be different 
is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're  justification, which you're arguing here  is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?
this court would ultimately decide it and they would ultimately decide questions such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the bench trial issue has been preserved.
i think there are some that hold that view, your honor, but there are some that don't. but all agree that it is critical to show market power in the tying product. if you can't meet that test, there's really no problem. if you can meet that test, then there's a division. some say there's a problem and some say there's not.
so why isn't the answer is in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case there isn't?
i  but i  i didn't understand this now. i guess i don't. forget the '94/'96 periods.
and then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.
does the  does the fec draw  distinguish between sham ads and genuine issue ads?
well, but the  the defendant 
that's the same as election system  that's the same as alaska's system. right? i mean, it boils down to the same thing. it boils down to an open primary, doesn't it?
well, again, your honor, if it is true that all methods of employing the assay  excuse me, all methods of employing the correlation are preempted by this patent claim, then it would be invalid under section 101. but to the extent the argument is an attempt to go beyond that issue, we submit morse doesn't support it and indeed this court's decision's in 
yes.
well, if you look at section 1307(b), upon request of the debtor the court shall dismiss the case, that is an absolute right. and for a clear reason. nobody can force a debtor to continue in chapter 13 against the debtor's will because chapter 13 requires the debtor to work to pay off creditors. that would violate the 13th amendment. so there would be no circumstance where someone could block a debtor from getting out from chapter 13, for constitutional reasons. that's a special case. that is why congress drafted 1307(b) the way that it did. official contrast that with section 706 where the court said the debtor may convert. now, there are, there are requirements that the debtor has to comply in order to convert, statutory, but there is also, a debtor cannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be part of an abusive scheme. i think the direct analogy is this court's decision in pepper versus litton. there a fraudulent party wanted the court to allow a claim as part of a fraudulent scheme, and this court unanimously said no we're not going to allow that, even though there was a subsequent remedy further on in the process.
yes.
 the gun, or what 
well, are you saying that  that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a  a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights, recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?
well, in the manuel court, the fifth circuit actually uses the term, a primary purpose.
no, i don't, justice stevens. or another way of answering that is i would say that even though you thought there was an establishment clause problem in the city of boerne case, i don't think you need to find one here. and part of that is because this is more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as  as it comes to this court in this application, with the exercise of religion in prisons. and i think that's an area like the military where the government is necessarily going to be involved with religion in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be.
your honor, the  the testimony at trial was ambiguous about the  about the car. the witness identified two separate incidents. she heard a car and she heard someone inquire as to mr. muncey's whereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come and tell her  her mother that her father had been in a wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave sobbing. those are two distinct incidences. and lora muncey testified that she did not know whether she had gone back to sleep. she never could identify or  or define the specific length of time between the two. but logically those are two separate incidences. it doesn't make sense for someone to come and ask where mr. muncey is and then to say, well, he's down by the creek. he just had a wreck. so it  it seems that just logically those are two separate incidences, and there's nothing in the  in the testimony to indicate that  that they're same.
it would be a finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which doesn't necessarily implicate the general notification provisions.
at the guilt stage, that's right. california statutes do require that victims' families be able to make a statement at sentencing. they also require that the victim's family, if the victim is not alive, be present at the guilt phase of the trial, during the guilt phase of the trial.
and  and we are not asking for trial-type procedures. all we're asking for is very minimal due process, which is that the person comes before a committee of three correction officials, and they say, what do you have to say for yourself? they don't present any evidence. they don't present witnesses. they say, you're a gang leader. what do you have to say for yourself?
right.
yes, but the fact 
2676 makes the  the scope of its application turn on whether there has been a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).
suppose 
right.
again, the large-scale dominant players in the retail industry have their own market power. they don't need the protection of the per se rule in order to enforce them. it's the next generation that this rule really aims to protect.
well, i 
but it sounds 
all right. but even for selecting a term within the base range, i'm going to read now from rule 4.20. part (b) says, "circumstances in aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence." that's not the way we refer to judges' reasoning about policy. that's the way we refer to proof of fact. and i don't see how under subsection (b) your answer to me can be correct.
well, do you acknowledge that the rule of reason analysis of the  of the initial formation can include a rule of reason analysis of whether it  it would violate the  the sherman act to  to have the new entity price both products the same?
sure.
he had the statute in front of him, didn't he?
yes, justice kennedy.
they say, if i remember it correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about the burden on the system. and of course, 90 some percent of your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the major thing that we originally thought it might be. do you think, just across the board, are they fairly accurate in their description of what happens in other states as far as you're advised?
well, your honor 
my argument is that the "special circumstance" finding, itself, is the invalid aggravating factor on death's side of the scale. that is what the california supreme court 
so you're not  you're not 8 making the argument.
but you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.
a school isn't an open forum. a school isn't there for everybody to teach the students whatever he wants. it's there for the teachers to instruct. and you're turning it into an open forum. if the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else has to be able to address that issue.
i would suggest that the commerce clause is much more concerned with efforts to relocate businesses than with efforts to protect individuals from burdens of local property taxation.
is there a contention that the medical was under-valued in the settlement or  i thought it was understood that it was the same proportion of the settlement. i mean, if you discounted everything by 50 percent, medical was discounted by the same percentage as everything else. is that correct?
well, justice breyer, i think you're right to say that, except that that's not what the act says. the act says 
i'll give you that. then  then it means a union or group of individuals.
well, he  he did or he didn't, but there was no money there. there was nothing there.
that's what you did, you didn't make the right objection. now you come up here and well, you are out. you can't make any argument. but  we are very generous, and we will let even people who make every wrong procedural thing still have a shot, if what they have, if what they are pointing to absolutely egregious. but your isn't absolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if you just didn't have any argument because you didn't follow the texas law. now, i take it, that's their point. what's your response?
it is one factor that reasonable counsel will take into account, but it is not the only factor. in some situations, if you're not following the defendant's instructions, it can lead to such a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that you couldn't possibly render effective assistance of counsel. so it is going to be a factor in that respect. but this case presents only the question of what happens when there's no objection, and when there's no objection, it makes no sense to say that where there's been consultation, no objection, that instead of allowing the lawyer to exercise his reasonable judgment on what the best thing to do is, he instead has to pursue an alternative reasonable doubt strategy that is less effective. and the sixth amendment simply can't be read to require counsel to pursue a less effective strategy that the defendant hasn't asked for. now, there's no perfect analogy here, but the closest analogy is to the division of responsibilities for appeal where the defendant has the right to say whether he will appeal, but counsel has the right primarily to make the strategic judgments of what arguments will be raised on appeal. so too here, the  the defendant has the right to decide to stand trial, but client has primary responsibility for making the strategic judgment of what defenses will be raised at that trial. now, there is  this is an important question, and therefore there is a duty on the part of counsel to consult with the defendant, but once that consultation has occurred, and there is no objection, and the choice that counsel made is a reasonable, tactical judgment under all the facts and circumstances, his pursuit of that strategy satisfies constitutional standards. there is no requirement of explicit, affirmative consent, and the florida supreme court's judgment should, therefore, be reversed. if the court has no further questions, thank you.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: let me begin at the threshold, on whether this court should consider the statutory construction argument that we've presented. the issue of statutory 
thousands.
that is correct, justice stevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our view the jury was properly instructed with regard to the other two elements, namely a dangerous probability of monopolization and a specific intent to monopolize. the sole question before this court is what constitutes exclusionary conduct for purposes of section 2, what constitutes it regardless of whether it's a claim of attempted monopolization or actual monopolization.
where does it say  i mean, the reason i guess i missed it is because when i looked at your table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it seems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6). that's the heading. each argument seems to support that. and then on page  you know, when you refer to this, i guess on page 26, you're talking in a section about what 1231 must be because of the structure of it. and then you refer to other provisions such as the one you're now mentioning. i just didn't pick up that it was a totally independent basis.
i think you should reach the merits of the case.
 actions, the sec can bring enforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5). and so, to that extent, misconduct that would be connected to what, in a private context, would be deemed a holder claim, does fall within the sec's 
why does that matter? because the jury was told that the factors were merely examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.
the  the first ground being? just an unreasonably long 
but do any of our treaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to violations of this?
but i would point out that even if the court is unwilling to go that far in this case, that you don't need to go that far to resolve this case and to reverse the judgment below for the other  because of the other failings in the plaintiff's case here.
well 
absolutely.
well 
well, that was the firing of a school teacher. there was 
no, if you pass  if you pass, i will think you do. and as long as you do, i think we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant. i'm being totally open and honest with you. [laughter.]
your honor, it's not our position that you should a rule of consent. i was saying if this court were going in that direction, that the acquiescence level would be what we would suggest.
isn't  isn't that 
i agree with that.
that's section 509, justice ginsburg.
i think that's exactly right, and i think that that is the teaching of ornelas. and it may very well be that a more specific instruction should have been given so as to make clear that the jury had specific issues of historical fact to resolve. but ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely the reasons given in ornelas. and if i could just say a couple words on the substantive issue of excessive force. we believe that in cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely be allowed to use handcuffs. in this case, i would just add that there were several additional case-specific factors that justified the use of handcuffs. in addition to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two members of a violent gang were living at the house. in addition, the officers had previously visited the house on two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions. and our fundamental problem with the ninth circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers in the course of a detention should really stop and investigate whether or not each  each individual that they encounter poses a safety threat. and we believe that that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. it would effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather than expediting the completion of the search. and for that reason, we believe that the ninth circuit's rule, its substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.
an idea of precisely what's at stake within the oneida litigation, as i understand it, the counties and the municipalities, the city of sherrill would not be left in the end having to pay; new york would.
the 
are you making the point that chief judge ginsburg made in the d.c. circuit that it is official necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a charge that is fair and reasonable?
 but the one thing 
it's not that they're tuning out. they take their jobs very seriously. but what they are encouraged to believe by the instructions and the prosecutorial arguments is that they will fulfill their responsibilities as jurors without coming to a final judgment on whether aggravators outweigh mitigators or vice versa. and it's the risk that they will do that, that makes this statute unconstitutional. and the kansas supreme court determined that there is such a risk of equipoise under this statute that it cannot comply with the eighth amendment. thank you.
i think this case, justice kennedy  i have three things to say about this. just this case is every bit as  as paradigmatic as the parade of horribles that they suggest. and here's my proof. it has been since 1997 that courts have been ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this statute. there is no evidence in any of the briefs on the other side or any of their amici that there has either been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large awards. and if that happened, congress would do  would be attentive to it in the way that justice ginsburg pointed out when the local cable authorities came to  came to the very same committees 4 years before and said, we're being hit  there's an express right of action in 555 of the  the communications act. we're being hit with very large 1983 awards. please do something about it. and the very same committees 4 years before enacted a provision that said you may get only injunctive and declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.
i don't know if it makes any difference to the case. do you  do you think the court could have made findings that would have been justified? i mean, it takes a while to find an expert to say that a bond is genuine when it spells united with o, but  (laughter.)
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: a bankruptcy court has the inherent authority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad faith by denying his request to convert a chapter 7 case to chapter 13. courts have the inherent authority to take appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process. nothing in the bankruptcy code or section 706 purports to impair or limit the bankruptcy court's power to police the integrity of its own proceedings.
isn't that  isn't that your case?
 just that "our clients don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad advice."
it was never approved. and that's clear, there was never any valid assignment. that's why the reciprocal arrangement had to be negotiated anew and again, i point to 43 
yes. i was going to say that because our concern is structural with the design of the oregon system as it's been approved by the oregon supreme court, i don't think this inadequate remedy can save that system.
but  but 
may i go back to one of your reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay for this? they're being singled out to pay for it in the excise tax situation. do you come to different answers, depending whether it's excise tax or singled out without excise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there is a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the expenditure of tax revenue? is that it?
people would be confused. for a while they'll think that "computer" refers to ibm, there would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the product, in fact, at least a very good one.
that's not my question. do you think it would be permissible  it seems to me your reasoning that you've given us would support that result. and maybe that's the correct result. i'm wondering what your view is.
 if you could just walk me through that.
your honor, as a matter of law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we rely on, neill v. yett and thompson v. deloitte, the two texas cases, establish as a predicate to any tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a matter of texas law. and that is exclusively under texas law for the texas probate court to decide. now 
there are in this country millions of dogs, many of the types of dogs that are used by narcotics detection teams, such as labrador retrievers and shepherds, are identical to the pets that people own. we encounter them in the parks, on the streets, and i would contend that an officer cannot be in the position of making a determination as to whether or not the individual that he encounters is going to be frightened by the dog. mr. justice stevens, if i may, i'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
 course 
your honor, if the court is acting pursuant to 41(b), which we believe can occur without a formal stay order, it  it can do that at any time before it issues the mandate. we're unaware of circumstances in which that's extended for indefinite periods of time, and i think this case is a perfect illustration as to why. this is a 
well 
adverse.
in our court we have complete discovery. they copy the file for it and hand it to us. so we know everything they know. but what we did not know is what the government would rely on as their overt act. they said it was the entry itself. the court of appeals ruled as a matter of law, rightly or wrongly, that that cannot be an overt act, because it simply 
it requires that the court proceed expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where damages are sought or are not sought. one of the interesting things about damages 
 would be implicit.
i certainly believe that, from the teachings of seibert and from other cases, that this court clearly seemed to be leaning towards cure, that there can be cures. i know that the position on edwards versus arizona remaining intact is probably, in many ways, not where this court is leaning. i understand that. but i certainly also understand we don't need to get to that extreme position to win, because the facts in this case are so clearly in our favor from the trial court's finding that giving it the  any deference 
why aren't you  you said, "the only question before the court is jurisdictional." if that's so, why isn't your position that the federal circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the outcome should be, the wrong label should  is  was used. it shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative defense. and then the  you're out of the jurisdiction box, but you're left with the same underlying question.
you're now arguing that under brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?
and they don't have to give that to anybody.
 increase the registration fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.
the court  i believe that certified mail is  is a more reliable method than first class mail because it requires the mailperson, the carrier, to get to  get a signature at  at  he has to go from a particular person. he can't deliver it to the wrong place. also, the post office itself has means whereby the carrier has to keep track of how many receipts he's supposed to have, whether he's brought them back and so on.
but 
and didn't believe it. right? and did not believe it. found as a matter of fact that the blood was  was not a result of the spill.
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the court will want to have handy, i think, the red brief of the respondents earthlink, et al., because i will repeatedly take you to the text of the statute, which is reproduced at the appendix to that brief. mr. chief justice, cable modem service refers to the bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two different things: highspeed telecommunications over cable wires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can access over that highspeed telecommunications. the commission admits  and it is a critical admission  that the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece is a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it is on cable wires rather than telephone wires. the ninth circuit correctly held that it makes no difference that cable companies market the telecommunications with e-mail and the like. congress cannot have intended to empower carriers to deregulate themselves through the nicety of adding some further feature to their common carriage. and i think we can demonstrate that through the text of the statute. i'd like to take you to two provisions at the outset. the first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it goes, justice souter, to the question of whether there's some difference that congress has adopted between telephone wires and cable wires. and the answer to that question is, no. subparagraph 46, the definition of "telecommunications service," this is the provision that leads to common-carrier regulation. the term "telecommunications service" means "the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public"  and here is the critical clause  "regardless of the facilities used." congress made quite clear it was not drawing any distinction based on cable wire versus telephone. i'd like to point you to two other provisions. they are not reproduced, because they're in the cable  separate cable provisions, but they will be relevant to your question. that is 47 usc 541(d) and 522. those specifically contemplate that cable companies will be common carriers. now, that's the answer to the question, is there a difference between a cable wire and a telephone wire? let me now step back to what the fcc said in its ruling. the fcc backed into its decision here, and it will turn on the definition of "information service," which will be on 1a of the appendix. it said this. look, cable modem service fits within the definition of an "information service." it's this bundled thing. and we construe the definition of an "information service" to be mutually exclusive of a telecommunications service. and that is legal error. and let me take you through the definition. subparagraph 20, information service. the term "information service" means the offering of a capability for, in a variety of things  generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information  via telecommunications. that is not language of exclusivity; it is language of dependence. there has to be telecommunications involved. if you all came to the court today via car, or i came via metro, there was a car or a train involved. now, i want to contrast that with another series of statutory provisions. and what these provisions do is demonstrate, beyond peradventure, that congress address the problem you are now facing. it said, "we recognize that there are definitional provisions that might otherwise fall within the definition of 'common carriage.' and if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will tell you expressly." there are four of them. they are reproduced. again at 1a, the definition of a "common carrier." it's the exclusion that appears at the bottom of the definition, three lines from the bottom, "but a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier." there's nothing like that for "information services." there's going to be one specific table that i think will be particularly illustrative. the next one, the definition of a "telecommunications carrier." it's at 2a. there's a specific exclusion. telecommunications carrier, these are the people that are common carriers. the term "telecommunications carrier" means "any provider of telecommunications services except"  so congress drew this out  "except that such term does not include aggregators of telecommunications services." the next two, and they are the final two, are at 8a, one that deals with private mobile services  it's denoted subparagraph 2  "a person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purposes under this act." there's a definitional category of "private mobile service." we don't want it to be common carriage. and the final one is the cable one, and i think it's very illustrative  right below that, subparagraph c  "any cable system shall not be subject to regulation as a common carrier or utility by reason of providing any cable service." nothing at all about an information service. justice scalia, you are quite right, this is a case about a statute, and the language has none of the indications that the commission is relying on here.
and  and i understand your submission  and perhaps it's distinct from the seventh circuit holding in this respect  to suggest that those are different standards, the standard for removal and the standard for preclusion.
yes.
yes. but you lose. i mean, if  if that matter is necessary for your case, don't  don't you lose?
however, what we'll see then, if there is no exclusion of evidence following knock-and-announce rules, are entries precisely like the one we have here, where the officers will, in fact, announce  they yell, "police, search warrant"  but then they'll immediately go in. officer good said that he went in real fast. he went in, and it took him just a few seconds to get in the door. so, that's what they'll do. they'll announce  some officers will announce, because they'll want the 
 because there's no dispute about the legal standard. we've all heard that this morning. the only other possible issue is rule 50 review. but merck has failed 
what happens  i'm trying to think of what the problem is for you. on january 1, your client's arrested unlawfully. now suppose the rule was you have two years to file it, starting now. what is the problem for you? the problem is maybe in a year, or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him. in the meantime, your trial is going forward because you filed it on time. so when they start to prosecute him, you don't yet know what's going to happen. and it could happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal because of the arrest and necessarily so. and therefore you have to stop the trial, i guess, because of heck.
 as far as i understand.
which would be california.
again, for two reasons, your honor. there's a difference between conflict and ambiguity. the words are unambiguous, and it's not simply the  there's two sets of words which they attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the unambiguous words that require employment by the person who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory language which says the regulation only applies to the exemption. so in the guise of deference, the solicitor general and the petitioners actually suggest to this court that it should take apart the regulation and ignore two of its three operative provisions.
 if that's really what new york's concern is, then why does new york say, "ah, but out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here  not a winery; an office  you can operate, and you can make the direct sales from that office, and even in"  i think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together  a group of them could open an office. now, that office, owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to have bottles on the shelf, is it?
but i still don't understand your answer to justice stevens' question. i had the  i had the same problem. the evidence of robbery here was circumstantial, strong, but still circumstantial based on his earlier statements that he was going to make a sting, i think he said, and then the witness saw him outside the window and  and he stopped the car. and i take it, he didn't take the stand and say, i stopped the car to ask for directions or something. but still it's  it's  that's certainly a jury issue as to whether there was a robbery.
well, i think in the michigan court of appeals opinion, it  it was a fee, and i think  i think what we come back to, your honor, is the idea is there a specific class of individuals or businesses that are benefitted. and i think that that's the distinction between a fee and tax. also, a tax is a general revenue-raising measure, whereas a fee is not. and that's another distinction of  of a tax. and indeed, this court  in national cable industry v. the united states, which we cited in our brief, this court said as whether an exaction is a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is to raise revenue or regulate an industry or services. one of the things 
i suppose that's a possibility, but in anderson, the court said absent some procedure like that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of the trial judge. maybe in a  in the future the tax court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate the raddatz problem that they now have.
no, no, it  no, but it'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at all.
would you address that last suggestion first, mr. feldman?
mr. freedman, you're trying to read back now into what apparently you recognize is  is not a flawed initial sentencing hearing.
no, it turns on the strength of getting an immediate decision on the immunity question. the immunity question i think is a question of an entirely different nature than the question of forum. in the 
you apply the same rule there.
well, why isn't that the right approach to the case then if that's the  we don't have to meddle with the rules governing the  the conduct of prisons, if you can prevail under that theory?
so why don't you say that?
and if that is the nub of official your position, then i would have thought your answer to justice stevens was what i suggested. if that's not your answer to justice stevens, then i'm not sure that i understand your case.
it's  it turns out to 
okay. this is an argument you're making to us, but i don't know how a juror is supposed to figure this out.
yes, sir. the  the exception, though, was at common law, counties could not be liable for the operation and maintenance of bridges, and that was adopted by georgia prior to the time of the framing and that was the law of the state. and we would take the position that that survived under this residual sovereign immunity theory.
i mean, what are we supposed to do? i mean, what you've done is say  of course, i could think of reasons that could have been their reason, but unless there's some reason for thinking that was their reason 
well 
exactly.
well, that would be an issue of fact.
they have to do it pursuant to their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a state designates a particular locality requirement and a special need, it can impose a label  it can impose requirements that the manufacturer has to comply with. now, the epa importantly  and this is in their regulations at 163.152  has specifically said that states have labeling authority. the states can impose labeling requirements. now, there's no reason why 
thank you, your honor and mr. chief justice.
to the recommended findings of the special trial judge. and i submit that if the special trial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations were mistaken because, based upon further consideration as a judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he has realized he made a mistake, i submit it would be bizarre to require a tax court judge to give some sort of  of deference to 
and, as i understand, at this moment  and i hope you'll correct me if i'm wrong  in a "weighing" state, we look at the aggravating side, and there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could take into account and weigh them against all the mitigation. i'm imagining that. and you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have. and what's something? there would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it  evidence into account it shouldn't have. so, i might have thought that was so. but when i read the cases, that isn't so, because i think it's  in clemons the evidence would have come in anyway. so, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the "weighing" state? and the answer, i guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the state said, "jury, you look to these three things," with a tone of voice that really made them important. and the jury then weighed one and two and three. it didn't have anything to do with the evidence. well, if that's the problem, california seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, "weigh circumstances of the crime." and that means that's not everything. that's not the history of this defendant. and so, the problem that existed in clemons and in stringer and in zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in california's case, too. now, i probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and i'd ask you to point them out. [laughter.]
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the question presented today is whether a claim for contractual reimbursement is cognizable under section 502(a)(3) of erisa. in this case, mamsi, the fiduciary of an erisa plan, seeks monetary reimbursement from the sereboffs, two beneficiaries of the plan. mamsi has consistently taken the position that its money claim is governed exclusively by the terms of its contract with the sereboffs. this contract expressly disclaims and replaces most equitable principles. at its core, mamsi's claim is nothing more than a request for money damages. this claim is not cognizable under erisa because mamsi is not entitled to any relief that was typically available at equity.
they were not looking for a gun at romero's mother's house, were they?
well, the guidelines didn't take everything into account, and the sentencing courts were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of being required to follow this book that necessarily didn't incorporate all of the human factors in sentencing. and they have held to that.
and i think that that  of course, that  as we point out in our brief, there's support for that, that historically the warrant must show the reason that someone is being arrested. so as we pointed out, there's this  an odd 
can  can you tell me if  if we had not granted certiorari in the case and the ninth circuit's opinion became final, what would have happened on remand? what would have happened in the trial court?
yes, your honor, and thank you. that is a more precise response.
right, but i  still, the  there has been, already, an  a miranda warning.
 principal place of business if it's different.
justice scalia, i believe that wiretaps are different for a few reasons. first of all, i do not believe they could have been foreseen by the framers of the fourth amendment. as a result, more pragmatic modern approaches for law enforcement's needs must be taken into consideration. but additionally 
i'm sorry. i'm not following your question.
the sixth circuit seemed to be addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing proceeding of stumpf and the wesley trial. well, you say the inconsistency we should focus upon is between the wesley trial and the motion to vacate. and i think you're right about that because i can't imagine the other being a problem.
but why isn't that always the case if it's time-barred?
you agree that the application of the harmless error analysis is a question of state law, though, correct?
well 
justice stevens, and may it please the court: the trial judge found melvin smith not guilty on the merits and unequivocally so. that acquittal entitled melvin smith to repose. instead, what he got was a moving target. the trial judge's later reconsideration of smith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same offense twice. smith's position on the matter is completely faithful to this court's precedent, and it makes sense in the real-world practice of criminal law. the state, on the other hand, asks this court to make exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals terminate jeopardy.
so they're willing to give away the records for free.
if we don't take the brooke group approach, is the alternative to ask the jury to do what the instructions in this case ask them to do.
 but do you know of any instance where we've said a state felony is punishable under a federal statute?
could the  could a judge have issued such a warrant in michigan? is that your question?
oh, i see your argument now. i think your argument is, most of the fourth amendment rules are really designed to prevent warrantless entries. but this one isn't.
but what if it didn't? i mean, i mean face the question that justice stevens puts. suppose you have a complaint that says nothing else except that these defendants entered into an agreement in  in restraint of trade.
that's one logic of the 
i believe that that would be a state cause of action, yes.
and part of that is because of the rules and the ways in which it's been adopted.
i don't think it's important, for, maybe, purposes of this, to iron this out, but i  respectfully, i don't agree with that characterization, because, even in the resolution of the grievance internally, the  what they found in the grievance was that they took no adverse action against him because of what he said 
thank you, your honor. that is 
 not only an 
well, i  i think because, one, if you do that, you could supplant  you  you have made the judge the jury, and the defendant, in order to present evidence of his innocence, have to  has to win a trial before the trial  before the judge.
well, i  i think the other factor that has to be considered, your honor, is as soon  as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring the victim into not appearing will put an end to the case, then it gives the defendant the increased incentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases that otherwise would have pled won't. so i think it will have 
justice ginsburg, i believe the law is it's either actual reliance or presumptive reliance. the taxing authorities actually rely or they are presumed to rely on the validity of the  of the tax returns. the fact of the matter is that's what's alleged in our amended complaint and that is what the facts are in this case. it is  and  and if you look at the solicitor general's brief in bank of china, the government cited this case with approval as an example of an appropriate use of third party reliance. and  and i  i submit to you that, while i disagree with the solicitor general that reliance is an element whenever mail or wire  i mean, for example, if the predicate acts here involved extortion, a hobbs act violation, violence in some form, we wouldn't be here talking about reliance. if it involved the payment of a bribe, we wouldn't be here talking about reliance. what is it about mail fraud and wire fraud that springs from the ground this concept of reliance? my point is i don't believe it has any basis in law, and i think this court should say so. that's  that's why we're here on the question presented. i think that this notion should be swept away because it has no basis in law. it's not in the statute. and this court has found on several occasions that where someone seeks to raise a requirement, the organized crime requirement, the prior conviction requirement, this court has said it's not in the statute. we can't engraft it onto the statute.
i know you say he's wrong, but if somebody in his position with his expertise can interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show that they're not clear on their face?
yeah, but 
and all circuits against you.
 the understanding of "principal activity."
no, but i  i thought you were conceding that you  you, in fact, do not have a  a loss  forget what you can recover  that you don't have a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop. and if there's no drop at the  at time of purchase plus 1 minute, then i don't see how there is even the element of a cause of action.
well, it's a source of authority but not a source of authority for suppression. and i find it implausible that we signed a treaty which requires us to suppress evidence of this sort, but allows the other treaty partners to do whatever they like, not  not suppress, let it in, rely upon consular protests. is  is that what this provision, you know, in accordance with domestic law, means, that  you know, each man to himself?
perhaps we can be concrete. if he  suppose the charge is he is a gang leader. will he get notice that says you are being considered for reclassification because you are a gang leader?
that's correct, and in fact, global crossing  global crossing went so far as to argue before the ninth circuit that there is no administrative remedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get fines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its position before this court.
i would agree with that if i use an  if  if you're referring to an atwater type scenario. if they have probable  if they decide to arrest, even though it's on a minor traffic case, such as atwater, which was a seat belt, as long as it's  if  if it's minor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-blown arrest, then all the consequences that follow from that arrest are  it's going to happen. excuse me. it's going to happen.
they did, justice breyer.
and it wasn't clearly done here. i mean, the  the jury was reminded that arguments of counsel are just that. but there was no attempt to correct what appeared to be a misstatement.
i agree.
right.
 begin talking.
did we mention them in those cases?
there was not a finding per se, but the facts of this case, spread upon the record, support the use of restraints in this case.
well  well, the yellowtail ad, which you cited and quoted as a example of sham issue ad, said that the  mr. yellowtail had taken a swing at his wife and he justified that because he said he didn't hit her.
okay. so that's the second reason why it would not fall within the  the beck rule.
and 
i'm  i'm confused here.
 the government claims there is an objectively valid basis for the action they action they would take.
and i don't think  oh, because i don't  the  that court was relying on a  on the  on the  on the question of initiation. what  what that court was doing was saying, "we're going to do a kind of voluntariness-lite here and take all the facts that might suggest it's not voluntary, and count them, and say  well, give  those, plus whatever" 
yes, your honor. there are two problems with that. number one, the conclusory assertion that an invention is nonobvious, just like the assertion that it's obvious from an expert, should have no weight because of course 
and then change it one other way. say, instead of defrauding new york, they defrauded the landlord and  and got a rent-free office space, and that cut down their costs. would the competitors have a cause of action then?
well, it depends on how big the river is, doesn't it?
if there were a specific context and they said 
what evidence was there of competition here? how  did you bring forward instances where they both bid for sale of special trucks to a single repurchaser?
 it turned on economic 
it's very  i can identify it. it's the appropriations that congress extends to this court that pay the salary of the marshal.
the eighth amendment requires jurors to make a determination, based upon individual characteristics, whether death is an appropriate sentence, whether the defendant deserves death. and when the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is required to impose death, they're imposing death without having made that determination that death is an appropriate 
well, that's true that each local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or revenue. but the critical part of the statute which has 59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. and i think the point that justice alito made bears, which is 
well, judge couvillion has been a special trial judge, i think, for nearly 20 years. but the point is special trial judges are bound by the code of conduct. the tax court has adopted for both tax court judges and special trial judges the same code of conduct that applies to federal judges under article iii, which 
i am saying that the application in state court is yet pending when it is here, because that court can be ordered by 
if we don't agree with you on the 
well, i think what you missed is that a simple citation to the exemption does not translate into an exercise of the power to define and delimit. because the department was very, very specific as to when it was exercising that power. in 552.2(c) it says the definitions required by the legislation are provided in the following sections and it enumerates them and does not include the third-party regulation. now petitioners would suggest well, that's just a definition. they also have the power to delimit. however, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising our power to define and delimit in subpart a.
i  your honor, i believe it's the  i can't answer that. i think it's  it's most  it's more recent than that. and i think the explosion of litigation under the act is more recent than that.
what  i know you contend that's not the case, but let's say there is a in-state subsidiary that's completely responsible for all the challenged actions, and the in-state plaintiff sues an  only the out-of-state parent. what happens in that case?
that's right. that's right, justice scalia. to the extent that sovereign immunity is understood to mean constitutional immunity, as distinct from some judge-made or statutory immunity, that's right.
but it  i mean, that  that statement is true, i take it.
well, let's talk about two different examples. if we have pled with particularity that the employer has 15 or more employees and is subject to title vii for liability purposes and the defendant in their answer admits that fact, then that becomes a  a admission 
 i was trying to make just 
no, i don't think that is right, justice scalia. i think that we would  we would say that the plra fully applies to claims under title ii and there is an exhaustion remedy. there is also, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in title ii, because, in order to get a reasonable modification, you have to ask for the modification in the first place. we also think that the plra applies, in all its provisions, to title ii claims. and one important provision to keep in mind is 1997e(e)  42 u.s.c. 1997 e(e)  which is a limitations on the damages that are available. and, under that provision, in order to get damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to also show some sort of physical injury. and the lower courts have interpreted that to require at least the kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the eighth amendment. and i think the plra, together with title ii, in the particular area of damages, which is what justice kennedy has pointed out is the particular area of concern under the eleventh amendment, is even a further narrowing of the relief that's available and a further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the title ii. so, i do think the plra is actually something that actually helps make sure that the remedy here is congruent and proportional.
he didn't apply against the government either.
i find that discussion quite perplexing.
well, maybe i'd better phrase it differently. do you agree that that is the only information on which the tenth circuit relied?
 that they found them beyond a reasonable doubt.
 on appeal.
there's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. there's nothing in there about that.
 contract disputes 
no, it was not, your honor. that's correct. what we have, your honors, is a situation where under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise to the level which would require the  the officers to enter the home without getting a warrant. and in the alternative, if they look at emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to look at probable cause. we have to look at their intent to enter because there's no probable cause to enter if they're performing that caretaking role to protect people. obviously, the ultimate concern in  in any type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home. it becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are  are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the credibility of the people who testify, and then also take into account the constitutional protections which the parties are awarded. and we believe that based upon the facts and the evidence that were  was presented, that the three different utah courts that heard this matter were appropriate in their  in their suppression decisions. thank you.
i'm trying to grasp the difference between the single ipo and multiple. so in response to justice breyer's hypothetical, they all agree in the context of a single ipo, let's make sure everyone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you say no problem.
or the school board? they actually both opposed, which is something  shows you something of the anomalies that you can get from this situation, which is the school board wanting to continue its practice of using these racial guidelines actually opposed the finding of unitary status. i would say, though 
well, i  i think you could fairly say the  the new statute reflects a judgment by congress that in these class actions of national importance, which meet certain requirements, minimal diversity should be sufficient. and, of course, that's constitutionally permissible. but i don't think there's been any suggestion that in the  the more run-of-the-mill cases there ought to be simply minimal diversity. i mean, there  there are millions, literally millions, of civil actions filed in state courts each year. about 60,000 end up in the federal courts on the diversity side of the docket. if even 1 percent of those cases moves over to federal court, that's going to be a doubling of the federal courts' diversity docket, which is about half the trials. so  and i don't think there's been any suggestion by congress  and, of course, complete diversity and matter-in-controversy are the two rules that keep that from happening. now, the  the class actions will be a sufficient  a significant additional burden on the federal courts, and to my knowledge, there aren't any additional resources to do that.
yes, there's no  no dispute about that. and indeed if the  if this case were classified as civil for purposes of  i mean, as criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an appeal, it would have been far out of time under federal rule of appellate procedure 4(b). indeed the authority of the district court to have granted the reopening period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the criminal context.
all the local processing cases, would they have come other differently if those facilities  the milk processing plant, the shrimp processing plant, and so forth  had been publicly owned?
okay.
i would have thought it was narcotics addiction.
it is, your honor. both questions are before you. i  i believe that 
the statistics he is referring to came out before congress amended the statute in 1986 and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically official presented a serious potential risk of injury.
well 
but 
in a technical sense, yes. but, as a practical matter, no, because the state would be offering all of their evidence, as they did here, to show that, circumstantially, he had the intent. we would be offering the evidence, which is regularly accepted and is found reliable for numerous purposes in our state, to show that there's a doubt as to whether he had that. and that's a completely different thing than the state attempting  having the burden on them to disprove it, which this court has so said in affirmative-defense cases involving self-defense, for example, that the state does not have to disprove that a person was justified or had a reasonable belief for their safety, but that they  and in the same token, you cannot prevent the jury from considering whether that raises a doubt as to the state's case. and that is the fundamental problem, the fundamental due-process violation here. if there are no further questions, i'd like to reserve the rest.
no, we dispute that, your honor, they've never produced one bottle from that period. in fact, we introduced four bottles of their 
yes.
because, for example, the appellate perspective as to whether a fact finder could make that conclusion, could any rational finder of facts draw that conclusion.
well, i think they overstated the significance of viereck. isn't viereck  does viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never mention the word soldier? isn't that a much more limited  much more limited holding? this was a prosecution during world war ii of individuals for failing to register as agents of nazi germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase  and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who are fighting the japanese on the bataan peninsula are doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to return a guilty verdict against these individuals. now, isn't that very different from saying that in a capital  at the capital phase of the trial, you have a duty to consider something that's very unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that what soldiers have to do in war time is different? isn't that very different?
"whoever knowingly engages in misleading conduct," which is later defined as 
yes, justice o'connor.
and  and were those cases in which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt, or were they post-prosecution damage actions?
it's not affirmative action.
as it happens in the other  in the companion case today, the prosecution itself, in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call and said, you have heard the testimony of  of the victim and referred to it as testimony.
okay. let's  the judge, the judge is on the bench. he says, there's too much crime in our community, look at these statistics, i believe that deterrence requires something heavier than the middle tier. nothing unusual about this particular crime. i'm making a policy decision about what the law should require in general. would that satisfy part (b) of 4.420?
i, i 
well, the court has 
no  no question. but the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in  in the second example. here, there  there is no such clear consequence. here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run. and that's different.
page  sorry 
you concede 
well, if we came to the conclusion that the treaty, by its own force, did not create enforceable individual rights, then we would have to get to the question of whether the president's proclamation changes that result.
he didn't think he needed it. he had a perpetual waiver.
but that's not in this case, i agree with you.
who  who sets the fee for the plating?
can i get back to this  the standard of review question? because it goes directly to this point. even if you think that the argument based on the semen is not harmless error, in other words, that the prior jury may well have convicted based on that, we're not reviewing that jury's determination. correct?
i think there would have been a substantial  had that  had that issue been litigated, there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause. but again, there was no argument on that point before the court. the court at pages 60 to 61 expressly stated  again, it was an assumption, but the court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause. apparently the court was considering the fact that the application for anwr did, in fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause, the alaska game law. the important point of that case for this case, though, your honors, is that the court embraced the construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the federal government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the state under the main clause. there simply was no need for congress to have expressed an intent 
i respectfully 
this court, under 
that's exactly where i started. and i wondered  that's what i'm uncertain about the standard for this. because as you and the others have been arguing, if the question is one about rules surrounding the use of deadly force. but then when i read what i read out to you, in graham, it seemed to me that graham, which comes after garner, says that's not the standard. graham is a standard of simple reasonableness and garner is simply an illustration of that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as applied to cars which threaten other people much more.
i don't discount all those things. all those things are available under our current regime where we have a per se prohibition against resale price maintenance.
well, i thought youthfulness 
that's correct, your honor. official
yes, your honor.
that would satisfy the requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a preponderance of the evidence?
but as long as 
we  we believe, your honor, that it is a compensation issue.
yes, but they did grab it back from us. i mean, if what you say is true, we should deny cert in all cases where the mandate hasn't issued or where the only stay for the mandate is pending disposition of  of cert. we should  we should put that in our rules. they did snatch it back from us, didn't they? what if we had granted cert?
no, they gave none, i'm talking about.
you can't provide any reason why there's a difference between those two?
the  well, the  the second circuit followed very closely to what the  what the district court did here, your honor, but what i did not see in the second circuit opinions and frankly haven't seen in any of the opinions except the eighth circuit opinion was any type of analysis about an explanation of why the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been diligent in state court. and  and in the absence of any kind of inquiry like that, i think that stay and abeyance simply is  is  it's unguided. there are no standards. if there are no questions, thank you very much.
let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the first amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the washington supreme court seemed to say  at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process. elsewhere in its opinion, however, the washington supreme court says where a statute is ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a manner which renders it constitutional the court is obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law. wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the intent of the people who enacted this statute were?
 challenge has got to have something different about it, something unusual that says this is why my ad does not fall within the general rule. and that's what i'm trying to get at.
your honor, they did not say there is too much uncertainty for them to form a judgment, which is the key issue. they said they preferred more certainty, but because of the nature of the endangerment standard, which emphasizes the important of regulating in the face of uncertainty, they have to at least explain why the uncertainty matters. and that is  what they did here is particularly troubling in the fact that they ignored all of the indications pointing toward endangerment. they looked at what we don't know without ever looking at what we do know.
with respect, i don't think it would be. first, the large portion of the courts of appeals that have addressed this have concluded that qualified immunity principles do extend to rico. and second, again, the focus of the inquiry is on the nature of the responsibilities. it's not on the particular offense alleged. it's not on whether there's a violation of that offense. it's the nature of the responsibilities, and here these responsibilities, enforcing permits enforcing access and use of public land, and protecting against abuse of those lands, are things that blm officials and other government officers have exercised their discretion to do for more than 
and do we know  does this record tell us what happens after the 60 days? to what extent where there are double cells, does the same race policy, although not formally adopted, continue? after the 60 days, what is the incidence of different race double-celling and same race double-celling?
the act treats him as an applicant for admission under 1225(a)(1). mr. chief justice, if i may
but they don't 
well, i think whatever the status the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), i think it's a  it's a threshold issue and i think this court under the rohrgas authority can reach that issue at the outset. and i think it would be particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that when we have a suit that we know on the face of the complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to determine first which court it properly belongs in, when that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified information that we know at the outset the suit should not involve in the first place. and i think there is enough flexibility in this court's rohrgas decision to allow the court to reach that threshold question first.
other than that information in the confession, which he had also found previously lacked appropriate corroboration at the trial  pretrial hearing as evidenced within his written order. i would also like to preserve the ability to argue harmless error, as we've done in our case to some extent. the south carolina supreme court's opinion was a harmless error analysis, but more importantly, in addition, that  that we do not believe and continue to assert that the matter wasn't properly preserved before this court based upon the manner and only the manner that it was raised before the south carolina supreme court in the direct appeal briefs.
there may be a cause-and-effect issue there, your honor. it may be the case that the types  that by encouraging the type of litigation under the act by switching the burden of proof has resulted in more cases being brought. the interesting fact 
well, it shouldn't be cited then. you're citing it for something that the court didn't hold.
yes.
because that cuts out an entire category of treaty violations where it may have been a strategic decision by counsel not to raise it, but where that decision is ultimately mistaken. and as the treaty is structured 
it's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. and thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? and the language doesn't answer it. so 
congress cannot regulate all tributaries. it could regulate some tributaries 
your honor, congress, here, is imposing a sanction, which this court has treated as exactly the same as a penalty. when 
it could. but in this particular instance, the contract provisions that blue cross are  and blue shield are seeking to enforce, as regards reimbursement, are markedly different. i mean, it's  it's not a small variation. it's a very substantial matter in terms of, first, the procurement costs and, second, in terms of what kind of a cause of action blue cross blue shield can take the money from. but that's not an  an incidental. that goes to the heart of  of the matter. if there's no other questions, your honors, thank you.
yes, justice stevens, what i just 17 read to you. now, pennsylvania lawyers 
 that's not true if the parents can afford to pay for it, and have, in fact, paid for it. then the child is the neutral factor in it. of course, in some cases, what you say would be true, but not in 
so it's a dual 
and why wouldn't he also have to have the  to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?
yeah, but if you accept the representation, then they sued the right people.
in that aspect of fogerty, your honor, the court had already gotten to the point of saying, "the standard is the same for prevailing plaintiff and prevailing defendant." and then, in the  in the passage we're talking about, the court was looking at the "one size" argument. okay. and that same standard for both should be "usually" or "nearly always." and it was in that context, in which there would be a "shall" or "nearly always," running both ways, that the court said, "that would be a rare bird in american law," the "both ways" british rule that  which is my understanding of the british rule  "that's such a rare bird, we would want to see some clearer indication of that." in this case, i submit, we don't have a rare bird at all. it is not unusual to have a  to have "may" interpreted in a statute as meaning "usually should," in some class of cases. piggie park did it. many cases in other contexts, following piggie park. so, it's not such a rare bird.
and then he'd have to file a second  subsequently file a 1983 case.
listen  it's purely the formal criteria, plus anything that's the same. now, same is vague, but it's no vaguer than a lot of other things floating around here today.
there were some that could  that would correlate, but there were others that aren't noted on the juror cards 
they hired more than one. in fact, the statute requires 10 in a 12-month period. so there would actually have to be 10 for at least 2 years. so that would mean at least 20 illegal aliens have to have been hired under the 1324 section that's alleged in this complaint. and probably for more than 2 years or an ongoing pattern of racketeering activity, and a person has to have been proximately harmed by a predicate act in order to assert a civil cause of action. beyond that, there is the  of course, the requirement of reves that the person  and here the corporation is participating in the affairs or conducting the affairs of an enterprise. and 
well, i think that type of evaluation, we believe, necessarily needs to be done to make a determination to the  to the probative value or the prejudicial value to the presentation of the third party guilt evidence of  of the defendant, that all those matters need to be looked at as to whether, in fact, it should come in.
well, it doesn't  why is contraband magical? wouldn't  wouldn't your point be when  when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger 
i thought that perhaps the treaty of buffalo creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these particular indian tribe members had their homes, or at least arguably. just no one was thinking about the remaining 300,000 because they had long left those. it had nothing to do with them.
so, here we have 180 days  180 days, twice 90  with no excuse at all presented.
no, no. i mean, he either stays in the united states 
well, we're  yes, i  i 5 recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but 6 your point was, oh, well, the state is powerless because 7 the prosecutor might not have the records. the states 8 have laches provisions precisely for that circumstance.
we would contend that the core sovereign function has to truly be a core sovereign function and it has to be supported by some type of history, some type of  of state dignity there and  and some reality 
did they have a warrant, a search warrant?
 the court can decide the question presented.
well, the problem at the trial level, i think, is you would be  you couldn't make it at that stage because it's the very lawyer who's ineffective. here, it was raised by a new counsel on appeal, and that's really the first opportunity it could come up because the  the lawyer who didn't give this advice certainly isn't going to say, in  in the course of the trial, i was ineffective. so  and that's i think the point that the icj was trying to make when it said you couldn't use the procedural default rule.
what is  what meaning do you give to the phrase "in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section"? under your interpretation, you could just drop that  drop that phrase completely.
okay. so my question is i'm interested in the law of it. why can't i  what's  what  the  the constitution says reasonable or unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search. so this doesn't seem unreasonable. a policeman isn't a lawyer. he just has to do what's reasonable in the circumstance. it's a huge  well, i would be repeating myself. but what i want to know is what in the law makes that opinion wrong?
and  and in north carolina it's easy. it is basically a 3-year statute of limitations for everything. and for a retaliatory discharge action, you look at the  in north carolina, you look at the limitations period for 
what  what is your criterion that is going to stop every little thing from  from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not saying good morning to this employee?
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the united states submits that the operation of petitioner's hydropower facilities results in a discharge into the navigable waters within the meaning of section 401 of the clean water act. section 401 uses the term "discharge" in its ordinary sense to mean a "flowing out" or "issuing out." the facilities at issue in this case, which divert water, impound it, and then release it, produce a flowing or issuing out of that water into the navigable presumpscot river.
now, this ad could have been run by your clients by a segregated fund.
well, you know, congress has applied this theory in other contexts. one is the protection of endangered species. congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. it doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. and congress' reasoning is, "we can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period." now, are those  are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond congress' commerce power?
 there was a pleading stage, i would like your clear view on how much that changes. it has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?
have we ever  have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?
it would be an easy example.
so there are two competing considerations, both of which are very powerful.
right, because the employer  i mean, employers aren't going to 
no, i know. but in terms of the  we now have specific legislation addressed to the specific context. and all of the acts that you're complaining of in the original suit are actionable under the face act, aren't they?
but  but maybe  but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement. all you  so you file one sentence saying this person violated title vii. are you impliedly including all of the allegations of what constitutes a violation of title vii because if you didn't allege every particular element, it wouldn't be a violation of title vii? that's not how pleading works.
yes, your honor.
well 
well, we've said that triplett and  and boren are  are distinguishable, and you said, well, we've never ruled on this point. well, then triplett and boren aren't controlling.
well, justice 
if this was a mail fraud prosecution for defrauding jesse williams into buying cigarettes and the punishment was five years for that, the judge could consider in setting the punishment between zero and five the fact that this was part of a scheme that was intended to or may have deceived large numbers of other people in setting the punishment between zero and five. what the judge cannot do and what we were worried the jury would do here and what we think the size of its verdict may suggest it actually did here is to think that they could punish it that time not just 5 years, but 10 or 15 or 20 for all of the other punishments, for all the other wrongs that they find to have been done.
even in u.s. waters? that wouldn't make sense. an american buys a ticket in  in liverpool. he's disabled. he goes to new york, miami, new orleans, and he's discriminated at  at each step. no  no coverage just because of where he bought the ticket?
no, the  i guess it was another point. the olc opinion was  arose in the context where a judgment could be obtained at all only in court.
it was excluded with respect to mens rea, but, of course, all of the evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense.
well, i think you're also 
it seems to me we're dealing with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently ambiguous that you have to look to something else. then the question is what other things may you look to, and you say we can look to police reports. i say why not look at warrant applications or maybe the prosecutor's notes, or there could be other equally reliable documents available, it would seem to me, that would  which establish the facts.
justice stevens, i think that the sutton case is the closest. the next closest is broderick's will. sutton again involved both a trust and a will and was a construction of texas law, which we say the court has already decided in sutton, and texas law, which is undisputed, has the effects which we say it has in the brief. they did not contest, justice ginsburg, our construction or interpretation of texas law. i think also that the court's decisions in tarver and fouvergne and also ellis and o'callaghan 
 to arbitrators.
no, and i think i would put that with the hypothetical that i offered about the government adding a claim that rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the antidiscrimination laws. and i think there won't be a clear dividing line, but i think this is a line that courts have to draw for other purposes as well.
that's true, your honor, moving to the merits, that's true. and with respect to that, the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that this court laid out in the brown and williamson case.
i believe under ohio law that that's not correct. i mean, it's one of the few states. and i believe even the cases that are cited by the state would infer that.
i think the question in that case, your honor, would be about reasonable reliance on the warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake. and if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless search. and if i may just focus the court  attention on the claim of unnecessary property damage. we think that's quite analogous here in part because the typical  in the typical case, a premature or unannounced entry will be a forcible entry. but whether the claim is that the officers entered a few moments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a battering ram on the door, in either case the  the violation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and the items to be seized and shouldn't result in suppression. and in addition to that 
so what's the test?
but even if it would, official that's only one manner of attempt. and it seems to me, if you're going to do it generically, you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear, i would say, a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or extortion? indeed, i guess you have to use the least dangerous. wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct. now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned, and i would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned, which i would take to be extortion. wouldn't you say?
by  reading out the words "of the person who employs" her?
i suppose that a warrant like a  like a contract has a  a reasonable life. don't you think a warrant expires if it does not have a concluding date? you think it goes on forever and ever and ever? don't you think a warrant just lasts a reasonable time?
we certainly agree with that, and i would just add that i'm not aware of any decision of this court that would suggest that the type of statutory construction tools the court would use would depend on what was in place at the time that the statute was enacted.
 but what olc really did say  and comptroller general and congress promptly disagreed  was that  it didn't see a problem  olc didn't see a problem with procedurally imposing an administrative offset. what it saw a problem with was, it thought if an  a judgment would be time-barred, then a prejudgment attachment should be time-barred, as well. i mean, that was the reasoning of the 
but a violation of first amendment rights or 
if i just may finish. your example, i think  the example of this particular provision points out that what  the balance of what i was going to explain to justice breyer, which is that another reason why this isn't the apa model is that this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii) substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions. you can't discriminate, to give justice o'connor's first example, among providers. the  that was a complaint in this case. there is de novo review, it is clear, on those claims. it's not administrative apa review in any respect. and in fact, the district judge in this very case, judge wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were discriminated against, but i don't need to reach that because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.
well, i guess what i'm asking is what's the closest analogy you can 
well, let's assume 
 party.
i'm not aware that the court has expressly addressed that precise question, which i think is 
you can answer in this case, general. (laughter.)
no, no, i mean the portions that go beyond constitutional violations are no good. i'm not  i'm not going to read it unrealistically so that it only includes constitutional violations. but, to the extent that it includes constitutional violations, why isn't that lawsuit perfectly okay?
i 
well, there is no  well, the congress can prescribe  can enforce it in any state in which it is not authorized by state law. if the u.s. attorney general wants to regulate it in a state where it is authorized by state law, he must go to congress and get a clear statement of authority to do that.
yes, but you must take issue with the this is only a quick determination, unless you also agree with  disagree with justice  judge easterbrook when he said, the decision for the federal court is only two things. it's either remand or dismiss the action. that is, the federal court under no circumstances will keep this case for trial. either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.
but what if it comes up on appeal? nothing is done until it comes up on appeal.
 that?
i think that his  his expectation is unreasonable. and we would urge the court not to adopt that and enshrine that as the rule for fourth amendment, third-party searches. if there are no further questions, i'll save the remainder 
same gang.
no, i'm not saying that.
under my hypothetical there are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.
is there a difference  would you say there's a difference between a case where the petitioner comes into federal court in the first instance with this laundry list or as, if i recall correctly, this case, goes first to the state court and then, when it's dismissed from the state court, comes to federal court with the same basic list which has been exhausted, plus others which have not? would you distinguish the case on the propriety of stay and abeyance of passing up the state court, going to federal court first, going to state court with your pro se petition raising a bunch of claims but not all of them, and then coming to federal court?
wiretaps, justice stevens, are regulated extensively by federal statute, and under federal statute, a wiretap order contains a myriad of details that are not specified by the fourth amendment. among those details are the crimes that are being investigated and the time period of 
but 
i  i know in the case of a jury. but our question is what happens if there's a settlement.
if all of this is so clear, why can't the state legislature take it into account?
excuse me, that  i understand that, so far as the associational claim may go. but so far as the speech claims may go, i don't understand it.
i'm trying to be helpful in this respect. (laughter.)
and maybe that  and maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but when that same call is admitted into court, then  then it strikes me that you are a witness.
yes.
but the jury might find that it was deadly force.
i mean, it's incomplete. it  it just says all real and  what about all real and personal property? is there an intro that says there is hereby  there is hereby granted to the united  to alaska?
this one is designed to prevent damage to property 
 if we decided it  it was at least appropriate to give a hint, aren't we in a little bit better position than you suggested, in the light of carey? because in  is  correct me if i'm wrong, but i thought, in carey, the state order was not merely that it was on the merits, but that it was on the merits and it was untimely. in other words, it said a and b. and we said, you know, "that's ambiguous," to start with, and then we went on and said, "you know, sometimes 'merits' don't mean merits." but if the state were to revise its procedure and say, "we're either going to say a or we're going to say b, and that's our reason," and they said, "it's on the merits" or "it's untimely," wouldn't it make sense for us, even in the light of carey, to say, "okay, we'll accept that as the  as the state's reason"?
absolutely. absolutely, justice ginsburg. there's no question that that's  that that's what congress had to have meant under these circumstances. and the best example of that is the ceo who sells securities during the time period of the class action. there are dozens of cases in which that happens. does it create an inference of scienter? it might, because it's quite possible that he sold and  he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to sell. it is also possible that he sells only about 1 percent of the stock 
well, i'm not urging something as narrow as  as a semi-blockburger test. but here you have essentially two discrete conducts that were being examined by the officers: number one, the actions surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions surrounding the taping. and the trial  i mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police. at the moment devenpeck saw the tape recorder  and he testified at trial. when i saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest. the moment he saw that tape recorder and saw the play and record buttons were pushed, he informed mr. alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape recording. so when looking at whether something is  is sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete incidents for the analysis.
well, i think  let  let's put, you know, the worst for you. if it were put to congress, which would you prefer, that  that solzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst kind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and escaped from a foreign country who manages to get into this country can go in and buy a gun? which  which of these two would you prefer? and i think i'd say, well, you know, it's tough on solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun, but he'll probably get over it. (laughter.)
and he lost.
well, before  this  this is exactly an excellent example because it's one of the few things that was clearly changed by 1367, and it was changed in the direction of narrowing the  the jurisdiction. the understanding was that you could  if a party came in on its own under rule 24, said i  i can intervene of right 
now, why should we interpret the exception broadly?
it does not. the federal circuit answered that in the negative. the federal circuit rejected the interpretation advanced by merck, which was the rational predicate standard, which was basically a causal test, and held that the district court's interpretation, under the intermedics standard that's given in the jury instruction, that merck now concedes is the correct standard.
with the description of the pecos river master as being  as having only ministerial duties, and i can explain why.
but in the hypothetical you propose, justice kennedy, the  the prisoner was actually  would be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by winning the case, he's going to undo the state court sentence.
well, what  what is the rule if there are two successive  there are successive trials with different defendants and there can only be one shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is the shooter? what should be the rule, or does the  does the second person get the advantage? does the state have to begin all over again with both? or  or does the state have no obligation to correct either?
it  that way it works, in practice, your honor, is  and their form is in the back of the red brief  is that the distributor writes down the number of gallons received, and writes down the number of gallons sold to the united states, nets that out, and pays the tax on the net, so that it's  it's essentially done at the  at the same time.
we have not had any of legislators or statewide officers that i'm aware of.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i'd like to devote the bulk of my time to answering the state's arguments on the merits because the constitutional issue presented by the kansas capital sentencing statute is actually quite different than the state and its amici would have it appear. their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about the way the statute operates and the real issues that its operation raises. under the kansas formula, prosecutors can and do urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-making if they are undecided regarding the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. in other words, if the decision is too hard to make, the sentence must be death. the formula 
that is  that is incorrect, justice kennedy. it did not invalidate the inter vivos trust. what it held was that as part of the evidence that it was considering, in terms of the intent, the donative intent, that one portion of that inter vivos trust, an amendment to it, had been forged, but it did not invalidate it. in fact, it  it expressly held that the  the inter vivos trust is valid, and that was a basis for its conclusion that, indeed, this particular claim was also valid. this claim was a cause of action for interference with an inter vivos gift.
 in navigation.
no, but it is pretty clear that congress didn't really think about this problem.
well, they did act pursuant to the agreement, and that's what the court decided, but that's precisely what the president is doing here. the president is giving effect to commitments made by the united states in the vienna convention, in the optional protocol, in the icj statute and in the united nations charter.
we do have empirical evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between wal-mart and the main street stores; and why should this court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to congress, which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are?
even if the provision  even if at some point congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be  you know, made in america as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.
may i 
apart from the gang situation, is there reason to think that their minds change in the sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply because they say, gee, i'm in for a long time?
there is no determinative element in the pike test whatever. it is a totality of the circumstances test, right?
assuming that's so, for sovereign immunity purposes, why should it make a difference?
but  but there's uniformity because the government wins in both cases.
no, no, surely. what  the  the 
for purpose of 15(c)(2), our interpretation is that the kind of transaction occurrence is that core of operative facts that support the constitutional claims. that means that the objections  it is not necessarily true that one objection claim would not relate back to a second objection claim. it just depends upon whether they're closely related. in this case, the claims are not closely related. you have a claim made of confrontation  excuse me  confrontation clause, by the admission of williams' videotaped evidence; and then you have the admission of evidence of a coerced confession statement. however, it takes an entirely different set of facts to establish that new claim.
now, so you haven't found something in your research that suggests that  that 
they  they may well, your honor, and  and the point is in each of those cases, prison officials look at the object and say what's the potential for harm here. should we let them have it in their cell? there's a  there's a practice in ohio prisons of 
yes, the motion  well, it  the simplest place, i guess, is in the june 2003 district court ruling, which is in the joint appendix and attached to the brief in opposition, ruled on the petitioner's motion for an interlocutory appeal under 1292.
 then at some point it becomes severe or pervasive in a way that  that, it would seem to me, would raise a jury trial issue.
but whatever  i don't know, because i don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. but whatever the number 
no. i thought what you were going to say  but you're not. so i'm very interested in that, and i'm glad i asked. i thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.
so  so the  the argument is you  you should recognize this as a necessity. that, it seems to me, still goes back to justice o'connor's question. why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? and i thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. so my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude  to  to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?
certainly we have not asked the court to  to do that, and that's not necessary to address in this case. the  they're really two separate issues. that is, is it  is it rational to presume market power from the existence of a patent is quite separate and distinct in our view from the question whether it's rational to have a per se tying rule when there is market power. they're completely distinct.
if you reduce demand, you reduce prices? are you sure?
no, your honor.
go 
 a lot things.
well, justice scalia, that very well may be true, but we don't have any way of  of qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't have those facts.
yes. well, i  i think so.
isn't the refutation of the presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of market power?
where does it say 
the coast guard also. i'm not sure they went out on a regular basis, but they did inspect the  the super scoop at  at some point. there's no question about that. this court 
do you think that it  it is a reasonable description of what happened  he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities  that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?
 grass.
it has. in 1983, 2 years after payton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the mitigating evidence that this court has indicated the jury is entitled to consider. but what is important 
well, we don't  we don't believe that's the case because if you look at all of those subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural ambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue provision 
that is my understanding. i  i would have to really check on that, but that is my understanding. and again, we are looking at this particular situation. we keep talking about actual target. the petitioner keeps talking about derivative, incidental claims. this isn't a derivative, incidental claim. there is no one who has a race in this case that is relevant other than john mcdonald. jwm, john w. mcdonald, didn't get its financing, didn't get its credit based on the fact that it was just created as a corporation. it was john mcdonald. here, you have a situation where  and it's kind of a unique one  where there's a claim that john mcdonald, the actual person who was being discriminated against, can't recover but some other entity can. that sort of turns section 1981 on its head.
absolutely not, justice scalia. and i would go further and say it's also not a problem, if, in the real world, the conduct that congress sought to regulate was, in fact, in practice, generated by first-amendment concerns. i think that describes o'brien.
justice stevens, and may it please the court: it might help if i could start by putting this case into its context in both the united states and international patent law. section 271(f) is a limited extension of normal territoriality principles that is designed to shore up the prohibition against actually making a patented invention in the united states, but it does not take the further and extraordinary step of applying united states law to the conduct of copying parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is properly the subject of foreign law. as a result, in the context of traditional manufacturing, for example, it has always been understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while companies cannot make parts in the united states for final assembly abroad  that's too close to making it here  they may make copies in a foreign country by, for example, sending the design to the foreign country or sending a specific part to the foreign country that can be copied there. that distinction between copying in the united states and copying in the foreign country has two critical dimensions. the first is that it protects the foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish the rules of competition that will govern companies that wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by copying their products abroad, assembling them there and selling them there. the second, which is the flip side of that point, is that it enables united states companies to compete on an even playing field abroad against their foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and selling parts abroad, subject 
your honor, i don't  i agree with you that we're providing a service here, and we do use the law to require that haulers and generators participate in the service that we  in the system that we've created. we need to have  to achieve the goals that we're trying to achieve. we've asked our public to separate their wastes and we've asked our haulers to collect it in a way that's consistent with the programs that we've established.
the  the other sites are  are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in. if i just  can i just say, though, i think the fact that the pine river site is so obviously a tributary under  under any definition is one of the reasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced by petitioners, that this case 
 the partnership is an association of individuals.
it has not 
no, just before you go there, if i were a bond investor, i would much prefer issuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the assessed value. i'm just more secure.
yes.
yes, justice breyer.
well, i was actually interested in what your response was because i thought you have an interest in not losing your recovery in all those other cases.
 but that he could not subtype it.
no, they're not, justice kennedy. the internet is not covered.
that's right. i mean, our submission is that congress's intent in enacting an aggravated felony provision that captures aiders and abettors was that minor variations in formulation wouldn't matter for the reasons i'm giving. so it's ultimately a matter of congressional intent. the second reason why this is important is because if you were to apply that rule to aiding and abetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any jurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and abetting every single crime in the criminal code would not qualify for aggravated felony status, because an aiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the criminal code and is a potential theory of liability for every substantive criminal offense. so that would mean that in those, those broader aiding and abetting jurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated felony unless the government could somehow search through the criminal files and find something to prove that in fact the defendant was not convicted under an aiding and abetting theory.
but the sixth circuit obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted. that's the end of it.
any  it has to be  it has to be a court capable of entering convictions. i don't  i don't think it's ambiguous in a sense 
that would make it a 1983 action. and the critical point, as this court recognized 
yes, your honor. if i understand your question, the answer is yes.
well it is interesting when you look at  i mean, they're  it's a good point. it's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean. here it just says it refers to. let's see, the other ones  casual basis, shall mean. companionship services, shall mean. this one doesn't say shall mean. it says it refers to this. i'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.
well, i think if you were looking at a challenge that took place solely within the context of a single ipo, it would probably be so difficult that i think we would concede that you can't practically separate the two. what i think is important from the standpoint of the justice department and its antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a conspiracy that cut across ipos, and was an effort to fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements, or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting process.
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: this case presents a fundamental inconsistency to this court. congress said through aedpa that a habeas petitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one basket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign state is going to defend that judgment in federal court one time. rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many baskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the state, you're going to have to keep coming back over and over and over again. and this case here presents that  that very problem.
well, they are affected by the plan in this in this way, that in the past the district had used mandatory measures, busing students across town, to try to integrate those schools. and the board decided after many years of effort that it would no longer do that, but it was also of the firm conviction that it would allow students who wanted the opportunity to opt out of those schools to do so. at the same time, it implemented magnet schools at rainier beach, there's a new building under construction at cleveland. and so 
the question comes down to whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to read it that way. what about  does canada have an income tax?
yes, but louie, according to the sg, says, "we say here that this person is not liable  the government is not liable, because, in washington, washington would not make a municipality liable," while adding that the law of washington is that a municipality is liable only if a private person in washington is liable. so, i wouldn't think louie is very good authority that the ninth circuit thought it was for the proposition that you look not to the private person, but you look to only the municipality.
i mean, you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and can you go in right away if you see him doing that?
how do you classify right to reimbursement?
is there uncertainty on the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.
in our view, no. if it's a job  if the public employee's assigned job duties is to, on behalf of the government or the employer, speak to the public about certain things that are going on in the office, and he happens to get disciplined for it, that wouldn't pass our step.
is anything else possible?
 as  as you pointed out earlier, probable cause is not the standard that governs the investigator's conduct. these investigators procured a prosecution based upon a violation of the petitioner's  or excuse me  the respondent's constitutional rights.
well, but, i mean, the government 
well in fact, chief justice roberts, i don't believe that's the case. nothing passed by way of probate in this case. the  there were no assets in the probate. what happened here was that all of the assets  and the record shows this, and i don't believe it's  that there is any dispute here. all of the assets had passed to the respondent in this case before the will and the trust were actually submitted to the probate court. once again, this is a tort claim and it's a tort claim only for an interference. if those assets had never gone to respondent in this case, there would, nevertheless, still be a good tort claim. if, for example, those assets had been passed to respondent's child or to another brother, the interference itself 
well, i think the predicate to getting stay and abeyance, your honor, is that there has to be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one unexhausted 
yes.
i may not because new hampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to ensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance needs an immediate abortion, that she receives that immediate medical care in those circumstances.
 in the circuit courts of appeals, your honor.
well, why use the word "proportional," because the other thing is what the chief justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, i mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot? and if he has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot just as much as it might justify a little?
 police officers 
they are not. and part of the reason for that has to do with this unique structure of the act. it is a very nontraditional statute. it is 
under the restatement rule, which texas has adopted in the uniroyal case, which we've cited in our brief i think at page 47, that is true because the restatement explains that there are certain warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not understood properly and that if it can be proved that a properly designed product would be on the market, there are public policy reasons why that's what we want to encourage manufacturers to do. i mean, under 
i'm asking you whether 
mr. garre, doesn't the epa's decision on the first, "we don't have any authority," doesn't that infect its subsequent decision, "well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it." but they've already decided they don't have authority.
 that it didn't meet the gregory standard.
fair enough, but it's an extension of bivens.
it didn't seem to me a terribly emergency situation in  in that kind of a context.
well, it's  it's  it may be not a lot, but it's something. you don't have anything to the contrary.
all right.
did you ask that the relief ordered below be more restrictive? was that challenged after the judgment was entered?
right. i  i understand, your honor. i  i think  i mean, i  i would  it seems to me that at the end of the day, we have to say that the statute did what it did, and  and if  if it reversed zahn, it seems to me that it certainly reversed  reversed clark, and frankly, we think the conclusion is easier for all of the reasons based in the statute. one thing i would like to do before  before the light goes off here is  is talk a little bit about the legislative history. and of course, our position first  in the first instance is that there really isn't any reason to consider it because this is not a statute that destroys complete diversity. it doesn't do anything radical. it actually is quite sensible and limited and clear when you read it. so we don't think you need to go to it. but if the court is going to go to it, we would submit that there is a far more sensible way of thinking about the legislative history than grabbing one sentence out of the house report, which i'll talk about in a minute as to what significance it really has anyway. but essentially the sequence of events here  and i'll try to go through it quickly  is that you  and as mr. stearns said, you have basically three versions of this  of this enactment. the last one got tweaked a little bit at the end. the first version is the  is the subcommittee report. and as he indicated, the subcommittee report, which actually appears at page 14 and 15 of our brief, of our yellow brief  if you read the text of (a), which appears on page 14, what you see is language which on its face clearly does reverse zahn, and then you have the commentary that went with it in the working papers to the subcommittee, and that commentary could not have been more emphatic of  of the intent to reverse zahn. the second enactment, which we have put in an addendum to our yellow brief because it, frankly, plays little role in the case in  in thinking through the statute, is the section 120 of house resolution 5381. and essentially when congress  it's quite correct that the federal courts study committee did not specifically endorse the subcommittee proposal. it passed it along, saying it wasn't taking a position. when it got to congress, from somewhere a new enactment came forward onto the floor or onto the committee that was addressing it, and that's this provision in the addendum of our yellow brief. and all i'm going to say about that is that when you look at that, number one, it looks entirely different. number two, it actually does a much poorer job of preserving complete diversity, and it does, in fact, explicitly overrule owen equipment v. kroger. judge weis came in and testified and said, that's bad, don't do that. you know, you've got to show more respect for complete diversity, and  and you shouldn't do that. that got put into the ash can. so that's the end of 120. and the next thing he did, attached to his same testimony, was  was submit a proposal, which is in our yellow brief at page 16. and this  this is what we said we think you should enact. if you compare the language of (a) with the language of (a) in the enactment on page 14, you will see that it's a couple lines longer. it has a few more embellishments and words, but it is substantively indistinguishable, the provision in (a). and so what we have is judge weis putting forward a proposal that can't be substantively distinguished from the one that the subcommittee said, clearly correctly, would reverse zahn. the last question here is what happened then, and what happened then to provision (a)  there are essentially three things that happened to this whole provision that i'm aware of. one is they took out the words, on a claim, and that's the argument that's principally advanced here. they took those. so it's civil action on a claim. they took out on a claim. they also changed the last clause of (b) and they also changed the reference in the supplemental jurisdiction from case or  from  what is the  the transaction or occurrence to case or controversy. and those are all the changes. we would submit that there is no basis to infer from any of those things, and particularly not the first one that dealt with (a), that they meant by dropping on a claim to somehow say, oh, my goodness, you've got to have jurisdiction over all of the claims before you. again, that is inconsistent with the court's opinion in city of chicago. you can't come out the same way in city of chicago if the presence of a nonjurisdictional claim destroys original jurisdiction over the civil action. the last thing i  i want to say about the  the jurisdiction which the other side relies upon  essentially it's a sentence that says there was no intent to, quote, affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only class actions. and then there's a cite, a footnote to zahn and ben hur. that's pretty much what there is that they talk about. well, number one, as has been said, the authors  apparently the authors of that language, the ones who put it in conceded that this legislative history was an attempt to correct an oversight in the statute, which it would have been better to have corrected in the statute. we think that's significant. but i would go beyond that and say that if you just look at this language, no  no intent to affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only class actions, number one, most importantly, we don't think there's been a change in the requirements under 1332. as i've said before, this statute engrafted this court's entire body of 1332 jurisprudence in the first line of  of clause (a) and in the last line of clause (b), and so it's all there. no one has changed 1332. this is supplemental jurisdiction additional to it. and secondly, this is not a class action. there's nothing in our case that relates to a class action. that's an issue, if you think this is relevant, you have to deal with in  in the other case, but you don't have to deal with it in our case. i guess the last thing i would say about legislative history is that we think probably the most important legislative history here, other than the tracking of these provisions, which we think is quite indicative, is  is that the  the house report, among other things, also said that what they were trying to do was to provide, quote, a practical arena for the resolution of an entire controversy. and we think that in the context of our case, as  as has been pointed out here already by justice ginsburg, it makes very little sense to resolve our case by splitting it in two and sending it to different courts. thank you very much.
yes, but you haven't told us whether you think it was a vessel or not.
i think counsel for the defense would, indeed, contend that they were interwoven.
and we now want you to say that official the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it violated the equivalence. but as soon as you do that, you're going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial.
they could, and in effect, they do say that 
mr. hungar might have questioned your memory. if there are no further questions, we would ask that the court affirm.
right.
 we 
well, it's terminating it because there's not enough mitigating evidence.
the readiest ground for decision is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is a good means to avoid a complex due process question. there are two statutes that are key here. one is the appellate review statute. the other is the public record statute. the public record statute says all reports of the tax court are public records, and we're talking about a report of the tax court in this case. the legislative history of that provision shows congress had the broadest possible intent to make all practices in the tax court completely transparent. all steps in the adjudication were supposed to be 
well, the state would at least have the option in that case 
why would it be applicable to state prosecutors if it is not a rule. i don't understand that. is it applicable to a state prosecutor or not? if a state prosecutor asked you for your advice, is this opinion applicable. and you tell him yes or no.
well, your honor, going to the federal circuit, of course, the meaning of rule 50 was in dispute. and it was certainly, at that point, conagra's position that the evidence was sufficient  was insufficient, and that was the issue before 
yes, and 
 state court 
he was  he wasn't told. he was advised by someone who said the flra has no jurisdiction here because this isn't an unfair labor practice. now, of course, what the government wants him to do is to exhaust by going back to the flra which has already told him that it has no expertise on this matter. so let me turn to that third stage of the grievance process now, which is now he invokes arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because under section 7121(b)(1)(c)(iii) of the statute, only the union can invoke arbitration. now, this court noted, as long ago as vaca against sipes, that unions invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of cases, so that in vaca against sipes, it was 1 out of 900. there was a recent study, the most recent study i could find that was published, about federal government employees, dealt with civilian employees of the army, and it looked at how often did the 31 different unions that represent civilian employees of the army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the number of grievances that were filed. and it found that in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent got arbitration.
does the 
and that is 
its main office.
my  my point 
that 
of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. isn't that correct?
no. the question is whether this page 23 fixes what was happening in the past. this is their new policy.
and 
the same  the facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a 60-40 basis.
that's right. unless they're  unless they have  unless they are an attorney. which in many cases the appointment to someone who is an attorney.
certainly, justice breyer. first of all, texas has the right to prescribe the elements of its own causes of action, and under texas law, her cause of action depends upon two critical things, a legitimate expectancy j. howard intended to do this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of some kind. her claim  she tries to meet those two critical elements by showing two things. one, that j. howard intended to give me this  this gift in the form of this  this trust, and that it was tortiously interfered with because the living trust was rendered irrevocable.
it's the distribution of the percent of the, what is 
so what is this fair-use defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?
your honor, that is one possible interpretation of the statute.
well, it  it  i think it's more institutional that the focus has always been transactional, your honor. and the congress clearly in 982 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 clearly prohibits individual or joint efforts to raise prices, empowers private investors to sue, empowers the sec to sue 
that's one of the points, but also that we're much more likely to be able to identify the illegal activities in the first place. the suggestion that we would send inspectors to california or any other place to look at books and count bottles is completely infeasible. and the twenty-first amendment was intended to allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges that are posed when liquor comes across the border. if we had to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent compliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all. that's not, i would submit, a 
the walk is not compensable, because congress didn't want you to have walking until you got to the actual place where you would perform the services. and nobody's principal activity as an employee is to go take a shower or to go and pick up certain types of clothing. that's not 
no, that's not what we found in booker. we found in booker, or at least the way the lower federal courts have been interpreting booker, if you use the guideline range, and you're within the guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you don't have to worry about it. but we haven't held, and i don't believe most of the federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. and that is the case with the california system, if you go beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable unless you  unless you find one of the aggravating facts.
the extensive record below shows that with these contribution limits, attacking the corruption and the appearance of corruption issue, the candidates can amass the resources necessary to run effective campaigns at all levels.
 suppose i want 
 some 
which is sort of puzzling to me as why the states don't have a  an affirmative interest in providing the best notice that they can.
well, it is the role of this court to confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction. that's what this court held in quirin. and that's what we think you should do here. the tribunal itself can't be the judge of its own jurisdiction.
but that 
 that was joint appendix, page 181.
i don't  i don't really  who  who would set the price if it was not  if it was not the joint venture?
i 
well, the government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they  where they render the action here lawful. there's no  no problemo. what's wrong with that?
your honor, my time is up. may 
i didn't mean to say that. i meant to say he didn't have to be charged with the initial crime. in fact, even the principal wouldn't have to be charged with the initial crime or for that matter, any crime. the aider and abettor could be charged only with a consequent crime but in the course of proving that under the natural and probable consequences rule, there would have to be proof with respect to the target crime, because the elements of the natural and probable consequences rule depend upon what happened.
well, that's correct. it depends upon, of course, what those words are. it's really a combination of the words and the context of the words. here you have 
 think the officers had sufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search?
you mean congress has to, has to say that 
we're  we're basing our argument primarily on  on the common law that has been developed in  in this country since really davis v. united states through the present and has  has 
that's exactly right, your honor.
well, this is 
but isn't it also true that some  some economists disagree? and i'm just wondering if there's disagreement among economists, should we take one view over the other?
well, in fact, california provides a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my client 
absolutely. the injured party has to allege that the defendant knew about the contract and specifically intended to interfere with the performance of the plaintiff's contract. but, nevertheless, we know of no 
there's no doubt, your honor. and if we have to do it at the pleading stage, it would be impossible.
justice stevens, that's correct. had  had that technology existed in 1984, maybe jefferson parish might have mentioned it. but it's certainly the case that today there's no reason for  to get the efficiency gains from metering through tying arrangements. tying arrangements are a very inefficient way of getting the efficiency gains from metering when there is this completely transparent alternative. trident might not want to tell people what it's really costing them to put a bar code on a carton because if you tell the consumer, they might defect. but it  the  the metering argument is satisfied by a transparent use of counting technology today. so there's no procompetitive reason here. this is not a bundle. this is not a case where, as the concurring opinion in jefferson parish suggested, there might be very sensible ways to see efficiencies in a bundle where i buy two products at the same time, an air  a car that comes with tires and an air conditioner. but it's quite a different matter because the cost savings from that accrue to the consumer. there are efficiencies that can be passed on to the consumer by bundling two products that can be simultaneously purchased and consumed together. but this is a requirements tie case. there's no efficiency that's been demonstrated in selling the car but requiring you to buy gasoline from the car manufacturer for the rest of the life of the car, long after any patents exist. and in the absence of that kind of evidence, there's no reason to overrule a sensible rule that does not just date to loew's, as mr. hungar incorrectly suggested. it dates back to salt, to 1947 for arguments in our  we've argued in our brief that salt had to depend on the presumption. and the court was  with respect to the petitioners' argument that the court didn't know what it was doing when it decided those cases, we respectfully disagree. the court was well aware, as it indicated 2 years later in standard stations that there might be some substitutes for a patented product, and it reaffirmed the  the presumption anyway. the presumption makes good economic sense. it makes good litigation sense. and  and as an alternative to the argument that you should affirm the federal circuit on the presumption, we respectfully suggest that there's  there was direct evidence of market power here, the supracompetitive prices charged on ink to both the original equipment manufacturers and the end users, the customer dissatisfaction displayed in the petitioners' own customer surveys in the joint appendix at 393. but, mr. chief justice, that is the unusual case. it won't be every case in which a defendant is so imprudent as to create a  a record of its own anticompetitive effects on its tying  on its tied product requirements market. and in the other cases, it would be a  there's danger, justice breyer, that  there's been no harm to innovation shown here. the presumption has been in effect for 60 years, but there could be grave danger to this court lifting it. there may be many meritorious anticompetition cases screened out by that rule. so we respectfully urge you affirm the federal circuit. thank you.
well, was this evidence adduced at the habeas proceeding?
49.
but not  you know, you have a whole string of commercial products, but you have recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal function. and you also say that the total, the  what is it  cradle to grave, if the county took over all of the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't be any commerce problem, right? but if it does something less, there is?
 to just go in. so, if the rule you propose is adopted, then every police officer in america can follow the same policy. is there no policy of protecting the homeowner a little bit 
yes.
what  what if the court then  i'm  let me just get to  and i think this is consistent with justice breyer's question. what if the court, at the  at the point cert was denied and rehearing was denied, simply said, i  we're now operating under (b) and we're extending the time?
well, let me get  get to a different point. it  it does seem to me that we  we have to be very careful in this case not to distort the revenue law for other transactions that are not before the court. and the  the natural extension of your position is that anytime when the taxpayer enters into an agreement with an agent to pay the agents an amount contingent on the success of the venture, that it's not income, that  that the  that the payment is not income to the principal. and i just can't accept it.
but 
but that's been your whole argument so far.
that case concerned 
but that's not the proviso at issue here.
there are many more in this 
the district court was well situated to understand the social fact, historical record and arguments of both the lawyers and the parties and the statements of the parties.
it 
 not the state statute.
so that's  i just want to know why.
well, i think there are two sides to that coin. i think, definitely, the scope of the ada in the prison setting, you know, is important. i think that the lower court's reading of "reasonable," which i think is the  is the reasonable reading of "reasonable," if i may say so  is, you know, "reasonable" takes account of context, and "reasonableness" takes account of proportion, as well, the kind of accommodation that may be reasonable, where what's at stake is the ability of an inmate with a disability to go to the bathroom safely, like mr. goodman alleges, may be entirely unreasonable, where what's at stake is attending an arts-and-crafts class, or something like that. so, i think that is important, but i think the flip side of the  of the state's complete control over every aspect of the inmate's environment is, this is one of the few areas of government where states have affirmative constitutional duties, including 
i think they did, and one of the reasons that i believe that they did, number one was to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is that they told, as well, in 2263(b) the main difference between 2263(a) and (b)(1) is that the time when you're getting your certiorari petition ready for this court under the opt-in provision is not tolled. but the time when this court is considering the post-conviction certiorari request is tolled. it's tolled clearly by statute. i cannot presume and would not presume that what congress did was write these in numerical order and when it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting idea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change the language there. i think congress meant something different. and what it meant was the trigger time, the time that was going to be elapsing between the petition, between your final decision and when you could go to certiorari.
we sought to dismiss them.
it does not state a claim.
that's right. the same  same test as in strickland. it doesn't require proof that more likely than not the defendant would have been acquitted, but it undermines confidence in the outcome.
if that was 
may  may we go back to the  the choice that you were given by justice scalia first and then justice breyer? i thought that someone who comes in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.
i can't cite you authority, your honor, but i  we were very concerned about that. if there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third party beneficiary i would think should be vacated.
well, it didn't expressly. i 10 mean, there  there were arguments about his behavior, 11 but the problem i think we have with the simmons claim 12 here is that the kelly case had not yet been decided, and 13 you now have the aedpa situation of trying to show that 14 the state court's resolution was objectively unreasonable. 15 and prior to kelly, that's a pretty tough road for you.
under  what about south dakota against dole? south dakota had a constitutional right, under the twenty-first amendment, to set whatever drinking age it wanted, and yet we upheld the spending clause condition that if they accepted federal funds, they had to set their drinking age at 21.
not in the circuit court of cook county. that cross-examination will occur every time a civil 
is that what the eighth amendment says?
not  not this injunction. the question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation  in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the first amendment. there's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. i  i just don't think it's fairly included within the question.
well 
i'm hoping that it's a misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said, because the court of appeals should not have told the judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.
correct.
but you're the one that's asking us to adopt a rule. and i'm suggesting to you that there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule that you request, and that is the government's interest in regularity and consistency of its speech. they don't have to claim it on a case-by-case basis. you're the ones that are asking us to make this rule.
i think, your honor, in that case, it's  as the doctrine developed, the difference lies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the judicially created version of the forum non conveniens. i think you're correct that as forum non conveniens exists today, side by side with 1404, you certainly have the limited application that it will apply to only foreign nations or to a state court. and that's what i thought was the benefit of creating a rule that's rather limited in scope, that will not touch many other factors. it can be discrete. it can be applied easily. and that comports with federal rules of civil procedure 1. we thought that was one of the reasons why a finding by this court would be able to ease the administration of cases along those lines. if the court has no other questions, i certainly would urge that, based on precedent and logic and the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens itself, that the ruling of the third circuit be upheld. thank you.
 in 10 to 20 years 
i think it has to be an increase based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to that statutory purpose is an increase above what you would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit and of course 
well, it  it does and that case was litigated against the united states by my clients and  and we won in the peck case. and we think that should have ended the matter.
aren't you  aren't you confusing miranda, which is a question of comprehension followed by voluntary waiver, with the question of initiation? they are separate questions. and what our  what we are trying to get at is: if there is going to be an initiation on the suspect's part, doesn't it have to be a voluntary initiation? your answer consistently is, did he know that questioning would stop? and those are two different issues. one is understanding miranda warnings. one is voluntarily initiating a further conversation with the police. so, i don't see it  let's assume he perfectly understood the miranda warnings. but if the initiation was not a voluntary initiation, or an initiation at all, it seems to me you lose.
in every case where there was an opinion, counsel was appointed. the statute requires it.
i don't think we know exactly who it was drafted by. i think there is  there is some references in the congressional  congressional record that this is an administration bill. but i would, i would like to respond, justice ginsburg, based on the assumption that this was the secretary's bill. under the statutory formula, the language is clear that what is disregarded in  in ranking leas and eliminating percentiles of leas is those leas which fall above the 95th percentile 
well, i have a hard time psychoanalyzing congress, because it's sort of a corporate body, and i can't tell what member of member of congress is saying what. but when the court of these statutes, it generally reads them  and it, in fact, avoids, whenever possible, superfluity. and if this provision applies to administrative proceedings from the outset, subsection (i) is superfluous, it's  does no work whatsoever. and so, the  when congress amended this statute, it certainly clarified that, where there is no exception, this statute applies to actions filed in administrative proceedings. official if there are no further questions, i'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
your waiver argument is  is it under 106(b) or 106(c)? it's beyond both of those, isn't it?
well, that's one of the things the  the government and we agree upon.
we did not challenge in our certiorari petition, which this court granted, the ninth circuit's holding that in order for an attempt to be accomplished there needs to be a substantial step, and in an indictment under section 1326, there needs to be an allegation of what that substantial step is.
 the product. if it were the traditional robinson-patman act case, where they purchase for inventory and are both trying to sell the same goods to the same customers, then yes, the problems that we've identified here would not exist.
i  i think the answer is  is that if the  if the  the joint venture itself was an efficiency-creating joint venture that can survive rule of reason scrutiny, that business has the right to conduct itself subject to the restrictions that were put in the original agreement. that agreement to reserve the power to the parents would be subject to challenge as part of a rule of reason analysis whether they entered into an agreement later or not, but the challenge goes to the terms upon which the venture is created, not to the operational activities of the venture. mr. chief justice, if i could reserve the remainder of my time.
it was ordered for the purpose of letting the doctor know exactly what the assay would be. yes.
with respect to section 2676, bivens claims today, after the enactment of the westfall act, stand in the same footing as common law claims stood prior to the enactment of the westfall act. in other words, prior to westfall, you could bring a common law claim against an employee, but if you brought a suit against the united states, the judgment in that suit would bar the common law claim against the employee. in other words, the plaintiff had to make a choice. likewise, when congress enacted westfall and said you no longer have a choice with respect to common law claims, those have to be brought against the united states, it left the plaintiffs with a choice with respect to constitutional claims. they could choose to pursue a bivens remedy, but if they sue the united states on those claims, the judgment and the action under 1346 would be a complete bar to any action against the employee.
no, but 
well, your honor, there is also a problem which the government actually concedes 
the first circuit does  the first circuit rule, your honor, in digiovanni and fall and stewart does have a snapshot exception.
well, brand x says that, but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry under chevron. and we can use "foreclosed" if you like, your honor. but the clearest indication that the statute does not foreclose the secretary's methodology is a provision that i think hasn't been addressed thus far in the argument and that's that in the very same act in congress in which congress enacted section 7709, the provision at issue here, congress also explicitly endorsed and incorporated the secretary's 
 in which case 
 that always the case? i mean, could  can you enforce a license agreement based on an invalid patent? you thought it was valid  parties had a dispute about it  whether it is valid. you entered into agreement, say, "well, let's split the difference. we'll  you know, 50 cents rather than a dollar or nothing." it's determined that the patent is invalid. can the patentee then still say, "well, you still owe me the money. we've, kind of, cut  split the difference. that was part of the agreement"?
do you think it's open to us to reconsider aspects of williamson county in this case?
no.
yes.
well, it seems to me, justice breyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to protect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a burden, a significant burden, on every state.
to be sure. and the question is, can you cure it? and that's the fundamental issue we ask you to decide. can i reserve the balance of my time?
okay.
the issues of laches in time is not within the questions presented in this case, notwithstanding that it has been identified in earlier decisions and was actually raised by the counties in this court the last go-around. laches does not bar this claim. these were illegal transactions declared by federal statute to be of no validity in law or equity. the oneida ii decision which holds that background principles of federal law which would ordinarily incorporate state statutes of limitation don't apply because their intention with the underlying rule that only congress can impair or extinguish this right. those same 
 from our objective test when the officer actually has that information.
well, that sentence, justice ginsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that is being applied. and then the court went on to apply it to say, there are two things that satisfy the test. the primary thing, of course, is what takes up most of those 13 pages, the question whether in-home time-shifting is fair use, a question that was of considerable interest to tens of millions of individuals throughout the united states. but the court, in fact, didn't rely only on that; it said, "in addition, there was this roughly 7 to 9 percent use of authorized time-shifting." it wouldn't have had to even talk about that if the primary use, you know, was the entirety of 
but i don't 
less than 40.
but under missouri procedures, you have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the objection was that we want the same language, we want the language resulting in whole or in part. and out of respect for the state courts and their right to create the rules that govern in those courts, that was not satisfactory under missouri rules. missouri rules also have specific requirements for what you have official to do in the court of appeals. there's a "point relied on" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's required by rule 84.04. and it sets forth a very specific format, and it's supposed to start with "the trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons. and it says that negligence  it erred in instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole or in part. you know, there is no issue that was preserved in the missouri courts other than that challenge. cook versus caldwell which we cite in our brief, in missouri, not only do you have to object, but you have to keep consistent with the basis of the objection. you can't just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the court of appeals, and raise a completely different challenge to instruction 13. you have to stay consistent. and out of respect 
 my question would then be, isn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the attorney general can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug if the state of oregon has specifically told its doctors, under special procedures in defined circumstances, that they can administer it?
so you'd say there's  you can look to what justice stevens says. you can look to what is official in that record that seems to have indication of reliability, and if there is any indication at all that this was a matter in dispute, you can't count the conviction. that would be the rule.
yes. that is correct. and i think that is what will result under an effectively advisory system. but here we're talking 
i would say two things about that.
i think that if they were to do that, i do not think that there would be sort of any individual right to challenge that. i think that they would be adopting a policy decision that would be probably different than the one the colorado legislature has 
yes.
yes, one  the difference is that in one case, we've got congress, we've got the executive, we have one 
yes, your honor. and the response i have to make is that the reviewing court would determine the issue of new trial on an abuse-of-discretion standard, not on a de novo review of sufficiency of the evidence.
well, but number 6 was a young white  young white male, i believe, and he was excused on the ground of youth. so it's consistent.
yes, justice ginsburg, i agree. it is good law. and i think the distinction that i am asking the court to draw between that case and merrell dow is this. both cases should be decided under the rubric that arising-under jurisdiction depends upon whether a federal issue in an otherwise state law case provides a  a  an outcome-determinative means of resolving the case, and that  in other words, where the resolution of the case depends upon a substantial question of federal law. but the difference between kansas city title & trust and merrell dow is the nature of the federal interest at stake and the different ways they should be applied. in kansas city title & trust, the interest was  or the alleged violation was a federal constitutional violation.
oh, i'm sorry. then yes.
justice souter, that is a choice that congress could have made. it is plainly not a choice that congress did make because it applied the preemption provision to requirements that are either in addition to or different than. and whether a label is assertedly misleading because it fails to include something on the epa-approved label or 
well, because it would be  it would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it didn't override immunities to suit. but i'm not sure there are provisions that are providing for  i mean, that there are myriad damages immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute immunity from suit. it's fairly common, at least under california and other state law, for municipalities to be subject to suit for review of their  of the actions that they make. and that is the typical fashion that this  this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of providing judicial review of agency action. another consideration that supports the view that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act provides an entire process for the implementation of the federal statutes. it establishes federal substantive requirements that identifies the agencies to implement them. it provides federal procedural guarantees, apa-like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of time. it then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted mechanism for judicial review. in that sense, it is very much like the statute at issue in smith v. robinson. that elaborate process is particularly significant given the pattern of the communications act as a whole. the communications act repeatedly matches specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as an action for suit  i mean, an action for damages in court or an enforcement action in the commission in sections 206 and 207.
well, if  in fact, there is an arkansas statute that if monies that belong to the department are distributed in a  in a manner that is inconsistent, you know, with the interests of the department, that it can pursue either the medicaid recipient, her guardian, her attorney, or anyone else for that money.
your honors, this case is not about compensation. indeed, chevron's discussion of compensation  the first time that that occurred in the entirety of this case was in its brief in this court, as we point out, in particular, in footnote 6 at page 11 of our reply brief. this case is, indeed, about whether this economic regulation is legitimate. the ninth circuit's test was it doesn't work well enough, so it is illegitimate. that type of a test belongs under the due process clause, not under the just compensation clause. this court has time and time again said that it is not going to set up separate per se tests except in very limited circumstances and, indeed, it's not going to divide parcels in the way chevron suggests here and whether it's in tahoe-sierra or penn central or keystone, the court has said, absent taking all value or use of the property or in loretto, in the case of a physical invasion, it is going to allow these types of regulatory takings tests to be judged under penn central. what chevron is arguing for here is a separate test outside of penn central, divorced from economic impact, that concerns solely the legitimacy of the regulation. we suggest that that belongs in due process. we believe that what the court should do is say that what was stated in agins does not state a standalone test. tests for judging the legitimacy of a regulation belong in due process based upon a rational basis test and that other than the very limited per se categories that this court has established, regulatory takings claims depend on economic impact and belong under the penn central analysis. thank you.
 assuming the district court does the  the district court in the ninth circuit does the harmless-error analysis correctly.
what direct 
well, no  your honor, there are several states that have clearly placed the rule  by rule, on the  on the  on the person initiating 
that is correct.
it depends 
suppose the state had said on motion for resentencing in stumpf's trial, your honor, we took the position that wesley was the shooter in wesley's trial. the jury disbelieved that. we accept the jury's verdict. our position now is that  that stumpf was the shooter. we've learned from the jury verdict in the wesley trial. we've had 12 people. they heard the evidence. we'll accept that. any difference in that case and what we have here?
through traditional rules of statutory construction. i think that would involve looking at the other  the  the background that congress would have enacted the statute against, first of all, and that  that may well have  it may not have been courts of just the united states because, as we know, congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.
which can be revoked. which can be revoked, and that's the  the distinction that seems to me strange. when somebody commits a deportable offense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to be here. they are, it seems to me, in the same boat as someone who is excludable. they  they do  do not have any right to remain no more than a parolee has. we have taken away their right to remain. so it seems to me that they have no status anymore based on a prior admission that we have removed from them.
if present intent was merely to do what we have always done, you have to go back 20 years to find out that what we have always done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men so we will continue to pay the same rate. would the per paycheck rule apply to that case?
all right. if we  if we exclude texas and california, on your recording, we've still got 80 percent of the  the prison population in the united states, and apparently neither the federal prisons nor any state does  apart from texas, has this policy. why  i mean, how do you account for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that  that they are having explosive incidents involving new members based upon racial animosity?
the mandate, in this case, remanded, is that what you 
well, it is  it is the terminology used in rhines. and what i'm trying to do here for the court is to draw upon your own authority, the words you've spoken, as opposed to the test proposed by the criminal justice foundation and by the united states, which are interesting tests but in no way depend upon the court's own jurisprudence. i'm trying to offer the court its own tests that have worked.
well, i think if it's non-visible restraints 
yes, but the "continuously" does not describe the process of going from the master disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer sold in europe. there is no continuous process there. as i understand it, what happens is  let's just take the master disk and forget the photon for the moment. the master disk functions like a blueprint. they send, from the united states they send the blueprint to europe. the blueprint is put in some kind of a machine in europe. and by the use of the blueprint the machine puts electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive, and that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint analogy. and if it does, then any export of a blueprint or indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the '820, if that's the right number, patent in this case would be a violation.
well, your honor, again, i think the  the federal arbitration act, both section 4 and section 2 of the federal arbitration act, certainly permits that  that way of looking at it because section 4, as prima paint emphasized, says, you know, once the making of the arbitration agreement is clear, it must go to arbitration. and section 2 says it's the arbitration provision in a written contract  or the written provision in a contract that shall be valid and enforceable. and so, both those provisions do distinguish between the arbitration provision specifically and, in fact, treat it as an underlying contract. and again, i don't think there's any shame in admitting that prima paint, i think, recognized the important policy implications of a contrary rule, that 
no, your honor. i believe that there are two ways to read the federal circuit's opinion. to the extent that the federal circuit said nothing before the clinical stage is relevant to the fda exemption  if that is what the federal circuit held, we are  we are not abandoning the position that that is wrong. i understand that there is another way to read the federal circuit's opinion that grapples with the subsidiary questions that we're discussing here, which are all fairly presented in our question presented. and that's what i'm addressing myself to now.
but if  if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?
 what we're suggesting is that a measure which has the identical effect, and is structured very much like a provision which applies a tax to those businesses who engage in out-of-state activity, while excusing from tax those businesses that engage in in-state activity, is a tariff, by another name. and this provision, as 
they can be a component of the harmless error analysis. ordinarily in washington, we would handle that as a charging document challenge. in other words, the defendant would say i was never charged with this crime and therefore i didn't marshal my evidence, et cetera. it's a due process violation. either way, i don't think that the  the conviction stands much chance of surviving. i did want to answer, first, a question that had been raised by pointing the court to ja 18 where the defendant says, my proposed instruction makes clear that the deadly weapon in question is the firearm, that  not that some other kind of weapon might have been deadly. so i think that focuses the issue appropriately. i also wanted to point out that justice alito's hypothetical is really the state v. williams case that we cited at page 14 in our reply brief where the defendant was expressly charged firearm and the victim was shot during the course of the crime. and the issue didn't go  the  the same verdict form as we have here  in other words, it said only deadly weapon  was given to the jury, and the washington court of appeals, feeling itself bound by recuenco, reversed that finding. so i think that the opinion of the washington supreme court is unduly broad and should be overturned.
well, once you define the teaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so that it can be implicit, it can be based on common sense, i don't quite understand the difference between that and simply asking whether it's obvious. could you just explain what that adds?
yes.
yes.
thank you, your honor.
a warranty claim, justice o'connor, as this court made clear in the cipollone case, is not a requirement under state law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties. the court i think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the state cause of action or the state law create a requirement. that's not true in the warranty case because fifra doesn't speak to requirements in  as to warranties. it speaks to requirements in other ways. so what dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook. breach of that is not a requirement imposed under state law. and that has been, i think, verified by seven justices of this court in the  in the cipollone case. now, if i could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both cipollone and in a footnote in medtronic, the court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted. here our assertion is that dow put on the market a  a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses. we acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages. those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones. and the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here. now, if i could briefly address two points. one is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected. that was the basis on which the fifth circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons. first, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling. it doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label. and that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the cipollone decision was announced by this court. they have read fifra as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any state law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted. we think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label. because epa does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on  on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it. now, i'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. as your question, justice o'connor, noted, the epa does not evaluate efficacy on the front end. and in fact, the history behind these provisions is that epa understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect. if we could review the history for a moment. prior to the 1972 changes to fifra, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case. it was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the american law reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were. yet, notwithstanding that, when congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims. and when epa, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this. congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, epa has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the solicitor general changed the position of the government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect. if we could just take the case of ddt. for 30 years, manufacturers were sued for ddt and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that ddt needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product. now, in 1982, the reagan administration's epa expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the carter administration in 1979. and in the federal register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the epa in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products. we cited that on page 31 of our brief.
we 
we've never addressed that in 
mr. dreeben, i understood you to say a short while ago that if it were executed before the triggering event, it would be invalid because there was no probable cause.
i know, analytically, it's a different issue. but it would seem to me the normal rule would be whoever goes first has the burden of the persuasion.
that's 
i defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined 
well, there's no  but the point is that's not  when we took this to the arizona supreme court that's not an argument that the state made in opposition to our raising johnson against zerbst. then when we got to the federal district court we raised this again, this exact argument in federal district court, and the state in federal district court didn't object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in the state proceedings. we took it to the ninth circuit. they didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it appropriately in the state proceedings. the first time that question has even been raised here is in the reply brief on the merits in this court. and i think that's tied to the next point i want to make, which is significant, which is as the case comes to this court the ninth circuit has ruled that we have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing. now, what the state is essentially saying is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you didn't raise them adequately in the state court.
would you just clarify one thing for me? did they have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?
it could or could not be, and there may  may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate but 
but that person can assert a claim against a plaintiff.
i think you'd have a constitutional violation, but it would, in fact, be harmless, and i don't think you'd have a 1983 action because 
justice breyer, the 
could a district judge have done that?
well, what about 
one more question and then  how was it decided how much raw gas would be delivered to the venture by the two parties?
but if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?
yes, i quite  i quite agree with you that there is the difference that in the alito case as amended, it all happened before the jury got its verdict. in our case, it happened after the jury reached a verdict. now, absolutely true. and my question, of course, is why does that matter.
well, it would be a more difficult case to defend under the second 
whom does he work for? do mines hire these people, or does he work for the liability carrier, which i would have expected? i mean, if we're going to make the kind of suggestion that justice breyer says maybe we ought to make, we ought to have something in mind. and is it  is it the  is it an inspector who works for the liability carrier who would be the closest analog in your case?
this is for children under ten, isn't it?
no. and so 
why is it different if the one further statement was made. and the employer knew that every woman is being paid less than every man. why isn't that sufficient under title vii, and if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, we saw one year that she was outside the range appropriate for this job.
but wouldn't it be precisely the same injury if they just didn't like the republican candidate in that particular election, decided to stay home?
yes, your honor.
that's essentially it.
well, the  the important 13 point is that  we think is that petitioner's 14 interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant 15 an indefinite period to challenge his state conviction, 16 and the only diligence that's required under his 17 interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in 18 seeing whether the motion to vacate your state conviction 19 was granted whenever it was filed.
that would be a motivation. that's absolutely right, why you would want to improve on the part. the federal circuit said that you would never do it in the way that was described here. you may be able to prove it some other way on a remand. this was a very specific motion, and the federal circuit faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was presented to it.
yes, sir.
the post office has every opportunity, just as in any ordinary tort. all the defenses apply. in this particular case, the post office  and it's been alluded to by several justices  would be that they have the defense of contributory negligence. they would have any defense that would be available 
yes. well, i think it's important to distinguish. there are two statutory arguments here. one is what i would call the incorporation theory. that is the argument that congress by borrowing the definition, the statutory definition, also necessarily borrowed and mandated adoption of the regulatory definition from the nsps program. that argument, the incorporation argument, was made by duke in its brief in 2004 in the d.c. circuit. the d.c. circuit addressed and rejected that argument at pages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 new york decision.
 in this suit.
 i'm being a little 
american law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the chinese court? it seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded.
mr. miller, going back just to the word strong, forgetting the particularization from it, do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms? they have to be more than 50 percent? more than probable cause? we're talking all abstractly here and i find it easier to think when i think about numbers.
but then do you endorse the theory of the court of appeals in this case?
so benchmarks are bad. presumption is bad. great weight, that's bad?
but the court  the court of appeals had jurisdiction to entertain an application for certificate of appealability. and this court, in turn, has jurisdiction to grant a petition from the denial of the certificate of appealability.
yes.
under your honor's analysis, a statute that said that if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered in the past, the alien may be sentenced to 15 years in prison, would also merely be procedural and governing the sentencing rather than the underlying act of reentry. i think that parallel hypothetical, which obviously would  would violate the ex post facto clause 
no, that's true, justice ginsburg. that's why i said, in response to justice breyer, that i think that the proper point to start to focus on is the  these  is the 1994 solomon amendment. and, at that point, there is a question about this policy. at that point, the american association of law schools does have its recruiting policies beginning in place, and i think the provision has been amended a number of times in the years since 1994. there have been changes in the scope of the funding that's covered. first, student-aid funds were put in, then they were taken out. and then, this is the most recent iteration of the provision. there's no question that what's at issue here is more than just the vietnam-era concerns about rotc presence on statute, because that's addressed in a different subsection of the statute. that's addressed in 10 u.s.c. 983(a). so this provision, 10 90-  10 u.s.c. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem of access to campuses for recruiting. and, i think, especially when you read the statute in light of the relevant history of the prior administrative interpretation, and that being codified and ratified by congress, it's very clear that this phrase "in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access provided to any other employer," is just that, it's a regulation of the manner of access, once access is granted. and it addresses this difficult question of, if you allow some entry and access onto campus, what level of access is sufficient? and so, i think that 
i don't 
or give up. but is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this court?
no.
well, as 
right. and that instruction specifically directs the jury to all the facts and circumstances of the crime; and so, not only the characteristics of all those facts, but it would even be appropriate for the prosecutor to refer to the crime as "heinous and atrocious."
that's right.
been exhausted.
justice kennedy, i think the general practice of the government is to file under both. i believe that's what happened here. i think the fact that we file under both suggests that there is a little bit of confusion about it. i would tend to agree with you it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under 12(b)(6) because if you think about the totten decision, there's really two strains to the decision. one is a recognition that the claim to relief necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't proceed. and that's very analogous to this court's holding in weinberger against catholic action. there's a second strain to the case, though, and that is that the very idea of walking into court and filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage relationship. and i think particularly if you emphasize that second strain of the totten decision, i think it's better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and they are effectively pleading themselves out of court because as  if you look at this complaint here, it starts out with a recitation of the fact that these individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and that they were denied certain promises that were made to them after they carried out, quote, their end of the bargain.
that's correct, your honor.
well 
right.
no.
 this area?
it's still a decision, binding in this case, giving you the right to admit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial.
right. i 
any suit is also in the first sentence, your honor.
any weight?
 the same situation existed in  in calderon.
ms. mahoney, we  you know, we all know that what are euphemistically termed "record-retention programs" are, in fact, record-destruction programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction is to eliminate from the files information that private individuals can use for lawsuits and that government investigators can use for investigations. and there has been nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if one of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the file stuff that can be used against you by either the government or a private individual. so, i would have thought that your argument was very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519. i think that 1519 gives me cause to believe that congress could, indeed, say, "you can't have record-retention programs." how else do you interpret 1519?
well, your friend's answer was that that was an implied right-of-action case; and, therefore, the remedies had not been spelled out; and so, you assume the broader remedies. what's wrong with that answer?
that's correct.
but i'm willing to accept for example 
right, but that had 
i believe that it  it would require  that he would ultimately uphold the challenge but on the basis of drawing an inference from the refusal to answer, and those two  adding two and two together, adding the 
 that would 
no, the argument 
all right, that's true. that's  i understand. i sympathize with that point. i'm worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't just cover the initial iep. it covers a whole range of things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive child. the hyperactive child behaves badly in class. the hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how it's placed. well, the parents might  properly, perhaps  think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might challenge that disciplinary mark. there can be thousands of different kinds of issues that come up. and, in all of these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the school board, for example, to show that the teacher who had the child sit in the back of the class or received a bad discipline mark or something? does the  does the school board have to prove that the teacher was right?
we do contend that it was right, your honor.
all right. then it seems to me that you cannot hold your position consistently with the state rule of court.
i disagree. because as an initial matter, this case in our view is about the categorical approach. but as to your question about what these documents show, no, the documents in this case do show that he was an accessory after the fact or a principal, but the government has failed to meet its burden one way or the other.
we don't have a quantification of the safety. what we what we have is the clinical experience of major leading physicians in the field, who've testified that they've used both procedures. in fact, many of them have testified that they perforated uteruses in non-intact d&es and they've never perforated a uterus in an intact d&e. and that in fact is borne official out by the chasen study, a very small study with very small numbers, but it shows all the serious complications are in the non-intact group.
yes, your honor. i believe it's the third amended complaint, the may 2nd complaint, and there was a request for $25,000 damages. and within these schools, in other words, this honorable court has never applied, other than in remedial, has never applied compelling interest in a k through 12 setting. in fact, those rights are not co-extensive. the school  this honorable court has previously stated in, for example, the hazelwood case, which was a first amendment right case, that that didn't apply to k through 12, or should it be 1 through 12 setting. and in the hazelwood case, that was a basic first amendment right and of course the first amendment right was exactly what justice powell championed as academic freedom within the bakke case. so clearly bakke and grutter are distinguishable. this falls into gratz, where you clearly have a quota, not less than 15 or greater than 50 percent, is totally inflexible as applied to our 
 which is what i just said. it leaves it up to him.
two statutes bearing on the same remedy. and i submit that the a.s. kreider analysis is not relevant here. the government also relies on brown versus the general services administration for the proposition that a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured statute will control over a more general statute, and the argument is of course that 7426 is that type of statute. but the problem is in the brown case we were dealing, the court was dealing, with the civil rights act and the civil rights act was clearly the first piece of legislation that had been enacted by congress to remedy federal employment discrimination. it was a brand new remedy. in the case before the court today, 7426 was a response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966 and that was that claimants who desired to seek redress from the government when their property was taken were suing the director. they were suing the tax collector. this was just a statute to give them a remedy directly against the government. it wasn't creating a brand new situation. it was clarifying that now you could sue the government directly as opposed to the tax collector. and in fact, the federal tax lien act prohibited suits against government officials, as was previously the practice in the united states. and so it's, this issue of implied repeal with the shorter statute i don't believe is apropos to the situation that confronts us here. and i would like to also simply conclude my argument with regards to the government's contention that the government needs to know. in this particular case the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984. the government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993 and 1994, 12 years after the first tax year. the government did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years after the first tax year. during this time the government knew, very clearly knew, what the situation was in this case and for whatever reason did not take prompt action. therefore, on behalf of the petitioner, i ask that you reverse and send this case back to the district court for proceedings under the refund statute.
yes, all right.
experts that were hired 6 primarily to say what is his present mental condition, not 7 what happened in the past.
well, mr. chief justice, a rico enterprise among  is a conspiracy to commit crime, but it's conspiracy plus. the plus is 
right.
it's an express  it's an  it's solely for an expressive purpose.
what is a pl-110 settlee?
i think it would be, as horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was  if it was  involved the manufacturer in some way, it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.
can we  can we just back up to cabrera? the d.c. circuit did not publish that and 
isn't that exactly what we have here?
you think the eleventh circuit is wrong?
yes, after banks and  and richards, especially richards, if the police had reasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a position where it could be easily disposed and if they had information about the weapons that could be used to resist the police entry, then yes, there could have been a  a legal no-knock entry.
well 
i thought that that duty is in connection with rule 4.
well, you 
well, if it was  if it was the same as miscarriage or loss, then that makes the whole term "negligent transmission" superfluous. and this court has told us that every term in an  in the  any exception should be viewed so as 
as to whether the government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't  the damage liability just doesn't exist.
 against internet 
 impoundment.
well, they  what's happening in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at least the rest of the balance of my time. the simple answer is that  is the following. there are  looking first at the states, there are states that use the term "the valuation." there are states that use "the assessed valuation," "aggregate assessed valuation," and there are a few states that use "tax valuation." it is uniformly the case in the states and elsewhere that the word "assessed" in this context is understood to refer to the valuation against which the property tax is based, whether that happens to be a place where it is full value or a fractional value; but it is also the case that at the time that the guam supreme  that the guam organic act was enacted fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of assessing property tax. now, in the territories 
can it be brought? it can be brought.
and that's in 
there's the right to  in the constitution, to raise a military.
doesn't it  doesn't it follow from  from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator's determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?
well, i'm not sure that that endorsement  in england, there is a square where they have king charles on one hand  on one end and he's looking at oliver cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other. i don't know if you have to endorse one or the other.
well, i suppose if there was no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to resolve the merits of that question.
and i think the courts have recognized that it's necessary to enforce it that way, because other methods of enforcing it will not work. but 
yes.
it gives some.
and i take it the trial  the speedy trial act doesn't say if the judge is thinking about something, it requires him to make an order.
but is there any precedent for that sort of thing? that is, i understand your point now, i think, but however you put it, it has to come down to the fact that this very, very complex and detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set of numbers. and i can understand how the patent application does not itself contain that set of numbers, but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate that set of numbers. but i then would be quite frightened of deciding for you and discovering that all over the world there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of information themselves and alone become components. so i'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field analogous instance where the transmission of information has itself been viewed as the transmission of a component?
well 
 improper statement was, "i bet you want to talk now, huh?"
well, we've held that they're  that the principal activity consists of doffing  donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?
and are there such?
i'm going to disagree on two points. first, at the trial court, the state did not argue that he could have been arrested for other crimes. the jury was never instructed on the elements of these supposed other crimes. and we pointed that out in the appeal in the reply brief.
not necessarily, because what we have is a statutory provision that clearly covers accessories after the fact. we do not have an example of someone who was charged under 108.51, but there are many reasons why that may not show up, partly because the charging documents don't need to so provide, in our view. so figuring out who was and who was not an accessory after the fact or a principal under 108.51 is not so easy to distill.
or do you concede that?
why? don't you have xeroxes? (laughter.)
oh, i see. the "knowingly" only applies to "uses intimidation or physical force."
well, i think it becomes considerably more than an ineffective assistance case. and the autonomy interest that's being protected here needs to be viewed in relation to the fact that the defendant can still retain his counsel. it's not that he's denied all choice of counsel. he's denied his first-choice counsel which 
well, i don't know that i need a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. what i need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money damages are adequate in a particular case. and  and here, it's very important to focus. the  the district judge didn't just say, i woke up this morning and i felt really good about the defendant, and therefore, i'm not granting an injunction. the district court here said, i'm making specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy of money damages to deal 
that is 
oh, of course. you require the jury to make a determination that it's within a reasonable period of time and that it's in a reasonable adjustment. there is no challenge to the jury instruction on whether or not the comparisons that were made were legitimate in any way. so, that's  you know, there's no question that this court can certainly establish a rule that says certain timeframes are either, per se, good or bad, but that issue is clearly not raised by the way the jury  this jury was instructed, because there was no challenge to the instruction, in this case.
well, in the postviability context it would clearly be, it would clearly be infanticide. i think in the previability context, if you have a complete delivery but the child isn't going to survive, i don't think it would be infanticide to necessarily let the child expire 
so that there would be no case of an untimely filing in this period when the court was  even if you raised no exception, was going through them.
i can't 
i  i 
mr. dreeben, you say focus on the emergency nature. very little of what took place in the 911 call is emergency. he's beating me. he's jumping on me. yes. what's his name? i mean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is joe but they won't if it's mike. it doesn't matter. which direction is he running? that's not related to the emergency nature of the  of the call.
yes.
 this claim?
because you read it's about harm. you say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, i mean really awful. and look at how awful it is. it's the kind of thing that would have hurt x number of people badly, maybe kill them.
justice stevens, i think that it's  it would be helpful if i could give you a thumbnail sketch breaking down, what i was trying to do earlier, between those where there's impermissible interference and those where there's not impermissible interference. the united states' characterization i think is incorrect. for example, again, this court has determined there's no jurisdiction for a federal court to determine the validity of an instrument. that's the first case in armstrong v. lear and also gaines v. chew. also, this court has determined there's no federal jurisdiction to determine the invalidity of an estate plan. that's tarver, fouvergne, and o'callaghan, broderick's will, sutton, and ellis. this court has determined that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to administer the probate estate. that's byers v. mcauley. this court has determined that there is no federal jurisdiction to take possession of the assets in the probate court. that is also broderick's will. i'm sorry. that is byers v. mcauley. this court has determined one may not impose a constructive trust on the beneficiaries as, in essence, a way to get property to them. that's broderick's will and sutton. this court has determined there's no jurisdiction to recover property from the beneficiary because of an alleged invalidity of a will. that's  that's the ellis case. this court has determined there's no jurisdiction for the federal court to direct an accounting from the administrator. that's the waterman case. this court has determined there's no jurisdiction to interfere with the state court's possession of the assets, again waterman, williams, yonley, and borer. now, no jurisdiction. it's always been a jurisdictional doctrine. and for the same reasons this court refused to recharacterize the  the domestic relations exception as a abstention doctrine, the court should also decline to do so here under the probate exception. now, the other side of the schema is, when is it permissible for a federal court to undertake a probate-related matter? well, if the state allows the claim, particular claim, to be brought outside its exclusive probate system, then federal courts may entertain jurisdiction as well.
well, we could work with that. now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they say "most are timely filed," then the next question would be, "all right, what period of time is it?"
no, your honor.
well  well, sure, but the contracts comply with state law. state law sets notice periods for cancellation, 10 days minimum, up to 30 days. we've cited those in our briefs. and so in most states and in many states here, within as few as 10 days after nonpayment, you can cancel.
no, i realize 
well, i don't think 
that's what the fourteenth amendment was passed for, to avoid creating the impression that a particular group supports a particular candidate?
you identify the agencies to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the state. and then you disregard 
that's correct, your honor. i'm merely pointing out that, under rule 59, once a motion for a new trial is made, all issues relating to a new trial are before the court.
 at the time 
no, your honor.
we did. we did, and that  and that issue was not reached by the ninth circuit because after we had argued the case in the ninth circuit the crawford decision was decided; and it was at that point that the ninth circuit picked up on the crawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or not roberts would have meant that this testimony was unreliable anyway.
well, there was no 
well, right, but the state under the dusenbery case is not obligated to provide actual notice. the state is obligated to provide notice reasonably calculated to let the person know what's going on, and if the person is not responding to a notice from the commissioner of state lands and going to the post office to pick it up or asking for it to be redelivered, i don't think this court has ever suggested that in those circumstances, the notice is  is inappropriate because the  the landowner hasn't taken the steps that he should have taken to  to, in fact, i think a  a large part of what petitioner's argument here is, is really at bottom an attack on dusenbery. dusenbery said  the court held actual notice is not required. what's required is just notice reasonably calculated to reach someone. but under petitioner's rule here, the state, as soon as it finds out some doubt  and that's all it had here  some doubt about whether it had the right address because it may well have had the correct address and he didn't go to the post office to pick it up. as soon as it had some doubt about whether it had the right address, it has to take unspecified further steps to send it out again to another address, and if that doesn't work, presumably another address and another address. and each  whatever method, whether it's a directory or the internet or whatever method it uses, it's  it's going to create a litigable issue about whether did it do the right thing, did it use the right internet service, did it use the right telephone directory, did it go in a wide enough area, should it have done the whole country.
they don't agree with that necessarily, but i'm taking that as a premise.
no. he  he did. he said it is not random, and then in his supplemental complaint, he alleged that he was retaliated against for complaining the first time around and was selected out when he wasn't on the list to be tested yet again.
we didn't even have it then, did we?
correct, your honor. and in a key case we cited, the second circuit's decision, united manufacturers and merchants, where they didn't even hire an attorney until after the bankruptcy case was filed, the attorney performed services, filing a proof of claim, protecting the equitable rights, and the second circuit clearly held that those attorneys' fees were properly part of the unsecured claim, but it couldn't be any clearer. and the second circuit 
 very similar to the federal apa.
right. not funds 
as it comes to this court, it is not a pullman abstention case.
 internally.
that's correct.
after segura 
and so during the emergency period, he can repeat what she said.
i think the reason for that is because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior to prohibition, discriminate. it was not only embodied in the wilson act, but it was embodied in at least three cases of this court.
yes, your honor, i think that the test that this court has formulated do draw those lines. with regard to your point about divisiveness, the ten commandments is enormously divisive right now. i don't think we can ignore the social reality. the chief justice of the alabama supreme court resigned, there are crowds outside today. i got hate messages this week, not because people care about the ten commandments as a secular document, but people care about the ten commandments because it's a profound religious message. and many want that religious message on government property. and i'm saying the government can put the ten commandments there as part of an overall display of law givers, because, justice o'connor, it's an overall display about diversity of religion. but when the ten commandments sits by itself it is, to use your word right now, enormously divisive. and that's why, from that criteria, it does violate the establishment clause.
 that are indirect purchasers.
and it's issuing out 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: since gibbons versus ogden, at the very latest, this court has recognized that, in the system of dual sovereignty created by american federalism 
i don't think so. i mean, i think it's very difficult to find, in the due process clause, the tools necessary to superintend those kind 
 here? you have an earlier act that says, when you see those words, "10-year limitations," forget them where student loans in effect. now we have a later act, and it has the word "10-year limitations," and you're giving some reasons why 
a reason i thought they were relevant is just what you're about to address. they're evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring something within the confrontation clause. prior to crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule, it could come in. so you could bring in co-conspirators before the conspiracy ended. you could bring in, for sure, excited utterances. you could bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how reliable, you have to keep them out.
 that much different than any institution faced with slip-and-fall cases.
i can't  i can't second-guess the strategy here to concede it.
and if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right? they can do this business directly as a national bank and they're not going to be subject to any visitation?
that's because congress in aedpa has declared that you have to bring all of your claims in your  at one time, and if you don't, then your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless you go through the gatekeeping solution.
no. your answer to justice scalia stands on that. so you would not be making an argument that gang membership is merely a surrogate for race in that case if that were the policy.
it is a serious problem. over 70 percent of vermonters at  there was testimony at trial from an expert that over 70 percent of vermonters believed that corporate interests and wealthy individuals have an undue influence on politics in the state, and i think 73 percent believe that the average citizen 
 is there a  can you think of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a  an agency action that's been taken, and so forth, doesn't have the burden of proof?
well, it certainly doesn't require the commission to be a purchaser or seller, either. you know 
well, let me ask another question that may shed a little light on it. does the solomon amendment pose any restrictions on the extent to which the law schools can distance themselves from the military's views? can there be signs up at every recruitment office, saying, "our law school doesn't agree with any discrimination against gays"? i mean, can they come forward with their position on this in every recruitment office without violation of the amendment?
we have one. the criminal defendant will be disinclined to file his civil rights case on time because it will be used against him in his criminal case to impeach his bias.
well 
because 
well 
except that he only has to pay in one place, and  and if they 
yes.
oh, i'm not blaming you 
yes, sir.
may i ask you this question. supposing  i recently read a case from the seventh circuit on what they did in lacrosse, wisconsin. and as we all know, this organization has donated ten commandments monuments all over the country. and what they did there is they sold the parcel back to the eagles, their name, and put up a sign which read, this property is not owned or maintained by the city of lacrosse, nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon. now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?
yes, your honor.
was it  was it also clear that after the improvement, there would be no drainage?
i can't disagree with that, justice kennedy. the question is, does he have authority to tell a doctor in a particular state, not by reference to a particular drug that he may not dispense this drug, but that he may not dispense a drug for a specific medical purpose? and, as i've suggested, this is the first time we've ever seen that happen. and we think that's because it's inconsistent with the congressional design, which was to leave the subject of what are, and are not, legitimate medical purposes to the states and to  and to have the u.s. attorney general promulgate rules that deal with things like the  like prescriptions, scheduling of those drugs so that they are on schedule 2 or schedule 3 or perhaps 
the key, the key point is that congress has distinguished clearly and unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but it has not included affiliates in either section 481 or 484 of the national bank act. national banks are not synonymous or equivalent to the state-chartered operating subsidiaries.
 cover medical payments.
the question is 
the only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that.
yes, but isn't it almost essential, in one of these inquiries, to  to invade the attorney-client privilege over and over again to find out what they might have done with a different lawyer?
 an offense for which the death penalty is the punishment.
then, justice ginsburg, we would test the language at the end of great-west and we would have to go after a different defendant. and we would  we would have to test our luck under that type of situation, go after the person in possession or control of the funds, and we would be able to do that. and we believe that courts would  would allow that and would enforce our equitable rights in that type of a situation. i don't mean 
then it will be worse for them. i mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the names of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our procedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the united states. it will take someone who reads those about 15 minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies. that will be a terrible disaster.
if you  if you can get the venire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you  you get  get him off easy.
that's right, there would be 
but i don't know that.
the 
so in another case, if a government official feels that the ten commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the ten commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the ten commandments. and so you can have no ten commandments in city a, but the ten commandments in city b. general, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. and again, you're just doing with purpose what you did in response to justice scalia's question. you're asking us to ignore the religious purpose that is the most manifest value of these symbols.
yes.
i don't believe it does, mr. chief justice. in the first instance, we think the u.s. attorney general's claim of uniformity is overstated. we think it's clear from the text of the statute that congress intended to leave the definition of what is, or is not, a legitimate medical practice in the hands 
so, it's 
i have specific language from the treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you. are you not going to read that? [laughter.]
doesn't that come from an underlying principle that your position is not entirely consistent with, that is, that the defendant is presumed innocent? so it's not as justice scalia may have suggested that, well, he would plead guilty, but we're going to let him  we presume that the defendant is innocent. that's why the prosecutor has to have the burden on all issues. i thought that was the underlying principle.
but the kansas supreme court didn't redecide that issue in the marsh case.
was there a resolution, counsel?
no. younger v. harris is only  only defers the time when a proper federal civil rights action can be brought. there were  at the time this action was brought, there were pending state appeals in two of the cases. one of the defendants never appealed at all. the sixth circuit recently issued an opinion not 
 so long as they're still paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract disagreement? i mean, it's sort of like the aclu saying that the patent's invalid. you know, it's a nice theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete injury?
excuse me. he reasonably  because scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking the driver's life? is that why it's like the third circuit case?
 holding 
but that's 
i think in the normal contract case that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this case had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment interest would run. but this kind of case involves damages that go back 50-odd years. it could have been 
you agree with that, or not?
so, you 
right. it would be all leases on indian lands. it would be all leases which involve minerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold, silver, anything like that. it would also be all claims before september  all production before september of 1996. that introduces something of an oddity, if one accepts the government's position. it would be that, for all claims going forward from september of 1996, the government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years, those claims persist in perpetuity. when section 2415(a) itself was enacted, congress avoided precisely that result by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date the statute of limitations was enacted. and the very fact that congress didn't do that here is evidence that congress  to the extent it has anything to do with it at all  is evidence that congress, in fact, understood that there already was a statute of limitations applicable. and, in fact 
no, your honor. it's that skipper evidence is a specific and different kind of mitigating character evidence that doesn't extenuate the gravity of the crime, but it provides a different kind of reason for sparing the defendant's life. there is 
no, none of them do. they talk about the general principle under california law, about that a charging document does not necessarily control the ultimate conviction and sets forth the test that needs to be applied. but on this question 
well, again, we don't know 
 in this. they gain a greater chance of getting that evidence than if they let a few seconds elapse and the evidence can be flushed away.
if i  whatever else happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence of mitigation and did a weighing. and the key point i want to make sure i make here is that therefore any evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the time and had considered at the time and had weighed at the time by this trial judge. and that's a claim of prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even if one assumes  and we dispute it and i'd like too talk about that  but even if one assumes that there is a finding and we can't do anything about it that landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation of any 
for instance, if the employer deliberately waited to retaliate until the 6 years has past, that could be an instance. but the important thing is the retaliation provision in the false claims act is unique because it's designed to be a companion or an add-on action to the qui tam action. that's  if you look at the reported cases, the vast majority of those cases show the two actions brought together.
that's correct, your honor.
do you still have a declaration that the arkansas statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the federal statute?
i'm sorry. that's 201 to 202  201 and 202 of the cook inlet case, and that's at 28 of the blue brief. what the law was at statehood is that the united states had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels. now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that is that the law has changed. the law has changed since 1971. beginning in 1976, the united states asserted a 200-mile  what's known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the united states to enforce discriminatory fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that. but  and we have quoted a un study. in fact, the un study that we have quoted  and that is noted at page 29 of the blue brief. that is the study that's called the juridical regime study. it's the study that this court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, has used as the authoritative statement of the law. that study quite clearly states that if a  if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside  that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim. and what we have here 
 i don't think 
but let me ask you this. returning to our earlier discussion about pleading a specific exemption 
and i'm saying if we follow your lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say must be added to it?
we allege that they were coerced into that relationship, but we do 
well, i  (laughter.)
well, i don't  i don't think it is properly a habeas action. i think even in the decisions where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, i think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner is already here. he's already exhausted all of his state court remedies. it doesn't really matter whether it's section 1983 or habeas.
and that seemed to be one instance coming out of georgia.
well, they didn't have as much 15 as they would have had if they'd looked at the file.
your honor, the  in this case, of course, that's  that's not the  that's not this case because the officer was very clear. he said exactly what it was for, and then he  when he booked him, officer haner even booked him for illegal recording. so in this case, we're  we're not presented with a vacuum. but even in an instance where the officer did not state at the instant of the arrest why he was arresting the person, one of the benefits of this doctrine is that it would allow for an objective review of the facts in order to determine 
if they did consider it, you mean they did not respond to that argument in their opinion.
i still think the answer would be that there would be no relief under that circumstance because their  their  still their claim to having any entitlement under those rules at all would  i mean, you know, total strangers don't have rights under those regulations. alleged spies would have rights under those regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent with the entire relationship and the contract that gave rise to it. i would also point you to the weinberger decision, weinberger against catholic action, because there this court applied totten to not force the navy to produce an environmental impact statement even though there were regulations on the book  and the concurring justices focused on those regulations  where the department of defense said we do produce an environmental impact statement even if it's classified. so i think on the authority of weinberger as well, the very fact that there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to judicially enforceable rights. if there are no further questions, i'd like to reserve the time for rebuttal.
what about  what about  for example, the single most important feature leading juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the studies, is their residual doubt. every juror who hears sentencing matters directly after a trial automatically takes that into account. therefore, those who are resentenced and have a new jury should have the same kind of right. otherwise, it's cruel and unusual. now, i made that argument. you didn't make it. but it seems to me that there are several arguments that you might make in favor of the oregon supreme court's approach if, at least, you concede that it is up to oregon to control, through its evidentiary rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes in, et cetera.
yes.
yes.
it  it as a general rule does not have to do that, your honor.
and where does it say this?
that's correct, your honor. and the district court specifically found as a fact that the blood spill 
i mean, why do we make that assumption when we start out with the allegation of a tort and a violation of the constitution? i don't understand.
why is that the standard of fairness? i mean that, you know, that may be fine. but how does, how does a jury, a, what's the authority for saying that is the standard of fairness and b, how does a jury know that?
yes or no? yes or no?
well, your honor, there certainly is  there certainly are  in most states at least, there certainly are funds that step in if a workers' comp insurer or an employer does not make  is not available to pay an award to a workers' comp injured  a worker who was injured on the job. on the other  on the other hand, your honor, whether such funds exist to step in and supplant the payments not made to  in the ordinary health and welfare and pension context, i think not, your honor.
what about the contention in the particular proceeding that the district court  or the state fact finder did not, in fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit of the doubt to the prosecutor?
yes.
and how many  what percentage would they have shifted from making it look like a hispanic opportunity district with about 51 percent to when it would actually be one? what percentage does it shift from being looking like one to being one, both above a majority?
it simply wasn't provided 
no.
is it 
 i would agree with you.
because the joint  where you have the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, i'd say that's a separate issue. here, however, the living trust performed all the functions of a traditional will, unlike a joint bank account. in the sutton case, you had both a will and a trust, just like in this case. there, moses hubbard left a will and a trust. mary jane hubbard enjoyed the benefits of the trust for her life.
i do think that it's important, however, to realize that if one examines this court's probate exception jurisdiction over the years, it has consistently determined that the  the narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as late as the markham case, this court has held that  that federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of issues with respect to trusts. certainly this court has said that it can determine questions such as how to interpret the provision of a will. it has even held that federal courts can determine whether a will is invalid. it can make that determination if the 
i thought the gao study included not just the  the hours worked and the  the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part of the parent challenging the school board action, but it also included those hours and those costs expended by the school.
 the matter.
oh, that defendant was incompetent the whole time?
that is the burden-of-proof failure that the fourth circuit found. but the real estate roundtable brief, at page 11, identifies the fact that it's very common to have a special-purpose entity that is property-specific, which gives further rise to that inference. but it is a failure of a burden of proof that was ultimately found by the fourth circuit. and because of the failure of the burden of proof, we're not in a position to identify the party. had 
and i sue  i sue for public humiliation. see? i mean, what about that one? [laughter.]
so, you would say clemons should come out the other way, given the current state of the mississippi statute?
this is a criminal case.
okay. i 
whenever a state has  has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor  on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? that  that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. the state isn't picking on the poor. it's just saying that  that the  the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this  in this one instance of guilty pleas. and  and you say that  that is intentional discrimination against the poor?
okay. and your question is?
you're worried about winning in the supreme court.
i don't believe so, your honor. but with respect to the bright line rule that  that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional intent, as i was saying, that it's not a perfect system. and the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples that  that seem to implicate various policy determinations about what should or should not happen in a given situation. but  but our position  and we believe the position of the eleventh circuit is  is that congress has already weighed that now. congress has already made that determination. congress has already told us where the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the side of respect for state sovereignty. and i would  would also submit that  that the sixth circuit test and the functional equivalent approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores really both the statute and it ignores reality. it ignores the statute because aedpa tells us you can't revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are certain limited circumstances that are met. and it ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying state court judgment. and the only purpose for being there is to ultimately get at that state court conviction that is  that is under siege. with respect to the coexistence, the petitioner made a point about this case is somehow like the rhines case that was decided recently by this court. but in the rhines case, this court was balancing the exhaustion requirements with the statute of limitations provisions. here there's nothing to balance. here this is just simply a prohibition. congress says you cannot revisit except in these isolated, limited circumstances. and so rule 81, habeas rule 11, and this court's decision in pitchess all say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds differently. and finally, the courts do need a bright line that's not subject to variance, as i mentioned earlier. this is a workable standard. they're familiar with fraud. it's well defined in the case law. it requires more particularized pleading which makes less room for mischief, and it  it gives the courts an easily identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that congressional policy, that congressional policy of one basket of claims within 1 year and the state will come into this federal court one time to defend its sovereign judgment. if there are no further questions, thank you.
they're not totally different, because one of them is special circumstances.
what was in question was the search after the premises had been secured.
well, why is it a state law matter? why didn't he know about this possibility? why didn't he know that his predecessor in title had granted? why wasn't there an actual notice, given the fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as a matter of course to give mutually beneficial rights-of-way? i agree it wasn't recorded.
but  but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the ohio courts. if they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in state courts. state courts have jurisdiction. so it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.
but, justice scalia, it's 29 versus 14. and  but it's 
it would be after  it would be 
well, the  the warrant affidavit is going to be present in the files. it's  it's returned. it's  it's normally filed with  with the other papers in the case.
well, i  i guess the way i'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent federal functions and the  the noninherent federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the federal government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. with respect to the administrative support 
 at the time of suppression.
it is certainly the case that in searching through the docket entries, you'll discover that there was a holding by the district court of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure. but the point that is important here is that even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity claims upon the part of the federal and foreign sovereigns. and it is their theory that the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in federal court.
how can we say it's purely procedural with respect to the first time? i mean, the reason that was given is i have to  i need this time to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are genuine. now, the  the second circuit said  and i don't understand why they said this  this is a complex case so that continuance is warranted. was this a complex case?
but in this  in this case, mr. dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing, and able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he has great trust. he's instead stuck with a younger, rather inexperienced lawyer, and he says, that doesn't fit within my sixth amendment right. i have a right to choose the counsel that i want and not the one that the court forces on me.
that was the case where the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record?
there are two possibilities that were not requested. one is our felony  felony murder. felony murder is  is the killing of  that occurs without occurring with one of the seven offenses that we have listed, murder, rape, and so forth, committing another crime. or heat of passion manslaughter. and i would submit to the court that  that they never requested anything about the felony murder and they never requested the heat of passion manslaughter.
i think because congress did revoke the stay in abeyance provision in the plra.
but, didn't he go beyond saying it was weak? he did say that, but didn't he say that he doubted that it fit within (k)?
i'm  i'm not suggesting it be watered down, your honor. i'm just suggesting in case of a tie, in case the judge finds the question is in equipoise, then there should  the benefit should go to the  obtaining the reason and therefore obtaining a  a ruling on the merits.
 congressional intent.
i believe it is, your honor.
yes, your honor.
well, absolutely spending clause legislation. but we believe that the clear notice concerns of the spending clause are not even implicated. but that if the clear notice concerns were implicated, the statute is  clear.
well, it didn't 
i had just one other question, just out of curiosity, about how important this case is. how many prosecutions under this statute does the government bring without proving an overt act?
if i understand your position correctly, if congress enacts a program that favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but if congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and the president implements it in a fashion that favors religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned. is that an accurate description?
what do you think? what do you 
your honor, if i were able to write on a clean slate, that is the rule i would propose. i think that if you  the whole idea of zant was carving out an exception from conducting harmless-error review, and the court was assured that because the aggravating circumstance, which was only a death eligibility factor, fell away at the selection stage, there was really  it was  the impact of that aggravating circumstance was likely to be inconsequential, as the georgia supreme court found, and as this court found in zant. the simple approach would be to apply harmless-error review, no matter what the structure of the statute 
you're 
sure, because counsel themselves 8 testified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the 9 experts themselves said  now, let me 
no, justice breyer, it is not wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to begin with the sunday laws based upon the sabbath commandment which was a commandment about worship and the end with the secular reason for keeping those particular laws as this court has recognized in mcgowan. and in this case, even if they started off with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we contend they did not, they did not end with one and they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and confusing to them. that's what they tried to do in this case, the best efforts to try to follow this court's decision when there was really no specific guidelines for them to be guiding their direction. the ten commandments that justice stevens, you had mentioned about the versions, the versions i don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in this case or any other case regarding the ten commandments because if that were the case, you wouldn't be able to teach the bible in an appropriate context because there are so many different versions and yet stone and schempp has indicated that you indeed can teach even the biblical text with all of its multiple versions.
i think my answer would be the same as to the chief justice that in some sense, i suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some sense, i suppose you could say that there's a contract to provide it. but i think you can set the outer bounds here by reference to the employee benefits that erisa defines as employee benefits. but in any event 
well, that would be fair, and it would accomplish the other thing that i offered the 60-day presumption to accomplish, is to offer a sort of safe harbor where the petitioner knows that he gets tolling for 60 days, and need not file a protective petition.
 as presented.
no, i realize that. but, if we're asking, "what is important in the mind of congress, for purposes of the immigration law?" one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way federal law deals with it  i.e., in the case of a crime, whether federal law calls it a felony or federal law calls it a misdemeanor. you know, in your reading, when federal law calls it a misdemeanor, if state law calls it a felony, it becomes a federal felony for the immigration official law. and that's what seems to me odd.
i think i agree with you on that. i'm just  the reason i think it's so easy is because we get indigents. we get thousands of them. and all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, i want a lawyer. okay? that's all. he has to be able to write those words. and at that point, you and the others come in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.
well, certainly the practice of medicine by physicians is an area traditionally regulated by the states, is it not?
it was on the basis of the questionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty that more intensive questioning was given to some people than to others, and that the mere fact that a larger number of those people was black is not a violation.
the stay of execution?
fair enough your honor.
that this application is pending.
let me move to that if i could, because i do think that's significant. i think the court has elucidated the two potential readings of the ninth circuit's decision. it seemed to us as we prepared this case on the merits that the reality is that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a diligent job of performing the investigation, and did instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence was, then you view the waiver in a different light than of course you would if the counsel hadn't. so we acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.
what 
 without violating the clause and the secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.
so the williams decision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?
i believe that there is  it  the statute is pretty clear that if there is a  if it's compelling or requiring the state of ohio to engage in an unconstitutional activity  and that would be a segregation of the races  that there's a compelling justification  or a compelling governmental interest in not complying with the statute or saying that the statute does not apply under these circumstances.
and they did knock on the door, yes.
what  what basis would there be for deciding that congress had one policy objective as opposed to the other there?
i think there is a first amendment right for a newspaper, for example, to send a particular reporter to the courtroom. that's an interesting question. i never thought of that one. i 
i don't think it would be, in light of   in light of the analogous state law that you only get 60 days to 
but federal law is determinative.
because of the potential for disruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment that is entrusted to 
assuming you'd  we'd 
that's correct.
okay.
isn't he 
the moral reason would be 
well 
and you objected to that, i official gather?
yes, justice breyer, the answer is yes.
yes. if the completed offense is a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense official is also a violent felony. that's a fair statement of our position.
no, it's not.
 the court of appeals specifically did not address the mexican-american bar association speech. it focused only on the memorandum, correct?
yes, justice scalia.
well, i think, under oregon law, we are entitled to put on  well, first we have to distinguish between these unitary juries and these retrial juries, because, of course, the retrial jury has not heard the evidence from the guilt/innocence phase, from the original trial. and in the event that a retrial jury is hearing  they're hearing this evidence for the first time, and the state should not be permitted to just put on the evidence that they think helps aggravate the case.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court. i would like to start with the question that justice souter asked because there are some important principles that are really not disputed in this case, and i think they help to focus the issue that is before the court. there is no dispute, as we understand it, that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised exclusively by the comptroller of the currency. and there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental powers under section 247 include the power to make mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. and an additional point is that both federal statutes and federal regulations state that when national banks make mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through subsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to the exercise of the power by the national 
is there anything that requires the order?
we think that, legally speaking, all that matters is that the court could have, and that once 
well 
yes or no.
interrogatory number 3 in the fourth circuit supplemental appendix, at page 35, inquires about any person, which is defined to include any corporate affiliate, that has any knowledge of the tenancy of the plaintiffs. the objections are not in the record. again, this issue came up in the yellow brief, but they did not reply to that.
well 
a union that is not 
that is an excellent point, your honor.
well, there were a number  a number of cases in the alabama amicus brief, which is chilling reading  and i wish that all the people that sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before they sign on to them  indicates that often the 17-year-old is the ringleader.
i think you have to say that under your view.
yes.
mr. kneedler 
no, your honor. we  our position is that a federal habeas court may not look at all to state or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly established, only the holdings of this court, and what appears on their face. if there's a general rule, such as here, the question moves to the reasonable application prong. and under that prong, because the rule is general, as this court stated in yarborough versus alvarado, the more general the rule, the more leeway there is. relief can still lie under certain circumstances, but it's  it moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the state court's decision.
mr. chemerinsky, if we turn from what this court did, or did not, think about last time around to what those four counts were, would i look to find out what were those four acts of violence that remain in the case? i could not find, in any of the papers before us, any specific definition of what those acts of violence were. i mean, the jury was given  i don't know what  was it a dozen possibilities? and they found four. but which four, we have no idea.
ms. graeff, is there any case which says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with? is there any case which says that the effect of that is to cause his initiation of discussion to be involuntary?
 that don't happen to relate to the handicapped and, thus, are not covered by this legislation? you can't get damages there.
well, then you're not arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what you said at the first.
 there would surely be habeas jurisdiction.
it's a  it's a strong argument, on the other side, that if we adopt your position, the officers would have no incentive, other than their own judgment about their personal safety, whether to comply with the knock-and-announce rule.
that's exactly right, justice ginsburg. and, in fact, the reason that the plaintiffs won is that the state, in that case, the state defendants, offered four reasons, all of which were found to be not legitimate state reasons. it was a straightforward application of the rational- 
as 
but the district court, i think in this very case, found that commemorating the ten commandments' role in the development of secular law was not one of the state's purposes in accepting the monument. now, will you accept that finding as the case comes to us? that hasn't been challenged. we don't have any cross appeal. i assume we accept that finding of the district court.
yes.
well 
no, because the  the inmates are not interracially housed.
is it  if this is an ambiguous statute, do you  what mileage do you get from barrett? there is certainly an argument that what was  congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of saying, "if there is analogous felony  if there is analogous crime under state law, that should be included." official and that made good sense.
well, it depends, your honor, on whether the legal incidence is on the united states or whether the incidence is on the seller. under this 
california's not going to do that, because it's not a state-law question. it's just not a state-law question. but it's  i think it's acceptable for a federal court to adopt a presumption to assist them in deciding a state-law issue, much 
live to fight another day?
i think you could read the statute either way on that question, justice stevens. they interpreted it to say that there was no equal  there is no obligation to give entry if no employer was on campus at that time. the other thing they interpreted in the statute as a regulatory matter, though, was this second-order question of, "all right, if they get some access, is unequal access enough?" and as a regulatory matter, they said, "no. we need access that is equal in character and scope to that provided to any other employer." and then what congress did in the iteration of the statute that's at issue here, which is reproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition appendix is they effectively codified and ratified that regulatory interpretation by adding the phrase "in a manner that is at least as equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to other students that is to  provided to any other employer."
(d) on page 56a. i'm sorry?
your honor, i would say that we don't have any evidence that is as strong as we would like on that. what we do have, and what i would refer the court to, is the 2003 gao report on the way in which the  these provisions have been implemented. that is  it's cited in both respondent's and petitioner's brief, and it was relied on by congress in the 2004 amendments. and what it  what it demonstrates is that 80 percent  nearly 80 percent of all due-process hearings nationwide have occurred in just six jurisdictions, five states and the district of columbia, and that  and that, in those states  it happens to be the case at all, but maryland, which is one of those states  have clear rules that put the burden of proof on the school districts, and that the costs 
yes, that's right. and in fact, in misstatement cases, that is knowledge of falsity.
could  before you go into that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?
justice ginsburg, the secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies have their problems, depending on how your districts, the number of districts that you have in a state, their relative populations, how they line up. and 
and 
 against being shot.
well, in the abstract, i suppose that that's right, but in  in the concrete circumstances of this case  and i think it's consistent with what i was trying to explain is reasonable search warrant execution  all of the search team was fully familiar with the process that was going on. this  this was a controlled delivery in which postal inspectors were arranging themselves to make a delivery to the premises of the videotape in question. everyone on the search warrant team knew that until that item had been received and taken inside the house, there would be no warrant execution. and in fact 
well, he may or may not. bankruptcy courts have thousands of cases, and if there is an absolute automatic right to convert, a court with thousands of cases may put off that chapter 13 reconversion to another day. moreover, there may be individual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise the issue, and the chapter 7 trustee who typically will uncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if there's a right to convert in bad faith, and the chapter 13 trustee or the united states 
mr. kise, there are two applications. your answer to the petitioner is you have to file in the federal court within that 31 days. if a prisoner says, i can't manage a cert petition and a federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get any assistance, so i'll have to pick one or the other, isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that you're proposing going to be an incentive or a disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a right to do? he is going to have to pick one or the other if he is in this timeline.
you concede, though, don't you, mr. englert, that the language of the statute covers the conduct here?
thank you.
 want to have hydropower.
well, it just depends on whether you accept as a given that the third party claim and other multi-party litigation was clearly going to fall within the court's ancillary jurisdiction without the benefit of an express statutory provision granting that authority. if you accept that, then this makes a fundamental change. if i could 
in closing 
no. your honor, i  i  you say that you're a maine company 
yes. we think that the proper test looks to whether a company is trying to develop a particular drug, by which we mean a substance with particular characteristics designed to achieve particular objectives. to explain that, we recognize that basic scientific research into human biology and disease processes is not protected. that's just too far down the stream of causation. but once i get a particular concept for a drug, this says i'm going to treat the disease in a particular way by targeting a particular part of the disease process. then we think that the work done, going forward, with includes comparing different substances to figure out which would be the best active ingredient, is protected. to provide a concrete example 
so i guess we made a mistake with respect to the pecos river and what was the other one? delaware?
they haven't purchased in connection with the 
well, i don't have a position. i can't 
where  where is that testimony?
that  it may give that impression on those pages. later, the court explains that it's ruling only on the current versions of the software. and then in the june 2003 order, the court was explicit in saying, "if i haven't been clear enough, let me amend my june  my april order," which is what you were just reading from, "to make explicit the limitation." and we quote that in our brief. the great virtue of peer-to-peer decentralized software is that it doesn't require anybody to put stuff onto a server and then bear the cost of bandwidth, of being charged by the internet service provider when a million people suddenly want it. it automatically scales. it  the more people who want it, the more people will have it, because it will be out there on a million computers. that is an inherent distributional economy, together with the autonomy of the user, rather than having a kind of mother-may-i system, with having to check every communication through some third party to say, "am i authorized to make this communication," that are the virtues of this system and that make it clearly capable of growing the already large hundreds of thousands, even millions, of uses that this  that these pieces of software already enable people to do. one final  final word. we're not disputing that there are, in an industry-wide way, a set of important policy issues here, though there's nothing in the record about what self-help measures  digital-rights management, encryption, other things  there's nothing in the record what  about that. there's nothing in the record about what kinds of real industry harm is being done by this. right? this is all citations to websites in their brief. these are classic questions of predictive judgment, industry-wide judgments that congress should make to decide whether there is a problem in need of solution, and what solutions ought to be considered, whether changing the rule would have a overriding bad effect on other industries. and 
well, see, under those circumstances, i wouldn't have any problem calling mohawk the enterprise. i mean, that's the whole point of this. the  the logical enterprise here is the corporation. the question is do you go beyond that to create these completely artificial entities. i mean, you know, this  this associational enterprise doesn't exist except in the minds of the plaintiffs.
well, your honor 
there was an allegation, your honor, that 
i'm sorry, your honor. could you 
first of all, the response is that the statute  the rule does not use the term "core operative facts."
 let's go from xerox back to your ipod. how is that clear in the ipod case? i may not understand what people are doing out there, but it's certainly not clear to me. i know perfectly well i could go out and buy a cd and put it on my ipod, but i also know perfectly well that if i can get the music on the ipod without buying the cd, that's what i'm going to do. and i think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would guess that. so why, in the ipod, do you not have this damoclean sword?
mr. goldstein cited a bunch of eeoc briefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a single part of  of those eeoc briefs which say that the standard under the age act is less than the standard under the age act. what he cites to is a footnote in his opening brief where he quotes one sentence from an eeoc brief where an eeoc appellate lawyer said it is  is likely that an employer will be able to prevail more often. the eeoc never said  and  and i litigate against them. i can tell you the only thing that they would hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our favor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is that mr. goldstein has represented what their version of the defense is because that's not the government's position.
your honor 
it's  it's outside the  the statutory authority for two reasons.
isn't it?
well, the case, though, has not been improvidently granted, with the greatest respect to the court. of course, the case was important when the court granted it. the question, whether or not the united states will comply with an international obligation that every actor here  the united states, texas, and the petitioner  all recognize as binding, is an important question. the president has now come in and said that it's even more important, by saying that, in fact, the united states will comply.
yes.
no. if you can answer my question yes or no. are  are you arguing there are two mutually exclusive categories, or are there ads that fit somewhat in both?
your honor, i  i don't know that it hasn't. i mean, i'm  i'm surprised in a sense to hear that claim because in brief period in which rfra did apply to state prisons, there was an explosion of these demands. and  and i would direct the court to, i believe it's, 204, 210, 211, and 212 in the joint appendix to see some of the ways in which there's been this impact. i'd also 
he's been charged for being a gang leader.
well, but if it's your burden to prove it, how can it be waived by the defendant? i don't understand your theory.
because segregation is harmful. integration, this court has recognized in swann, in the first seattle case, has benefits. the district was 
yes.
 how does  how does david duncan's guilty plea  he entered a plea of guilty to a charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to impede the sec investigation by shredding documents. so, what were the elements of that offense that are absent in this one?
one never knows that in habeas corpus. but what you do when you look at what they were focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics experts. they had them read back right next each other. they made that call. it's their job to do it.
we  we agree with that position, justice stevens.
what do you make of the, sort of the revolution argument that whether it's contrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been applied in what is now the fed circuit for what, 20 years, more than 20 years i guess. and to tip it over now is going to produce chaos. what's the answer to that?
i don't know if that would be an appropriate remedy. it might be because you can have an involuntary chapter 7 case. but on this point about a court sitting in chapter 13, if on day one a chapter 13 official debtor files a plan in bad faith, the debtor can say: please wait, i've got a plan, i'm working on it, give me a couple extra weeks, and the court can say: no, i have the authority to throw it out. and what's particularly odd about this proposal is that in 2005 a court is categorically prohibited from allowing a chapter 13 debtor to proceed under chapter 13 if the petition is filed in bad faith. the court can't confirm a plan. so congress had no interest in protecting bad faith debtors after 2005 and they didn't before 2005. there's no policy preference in the code for bad faith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in chapter 13 or moving from chapter 7 to chapter 13, and we think this is a modest exercise of a court's inherent authority simply to deny relief when the court is already confronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is in chapter 7 or the debtor has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process. the last thing i'd like to say is 
i  they normally say no, that that's 
so i think tennard is utterly irrelevant even if it is right.
it depends, your honor. it varies with  case to case. in a lot of pro se 
yes. yes. i  if we had an atwater situation  in this case there wasn't an atwater situation because there was first a warning given. you're correct. there was a warning given. i'm sorry. the officer gillette told caballes he was going to give him a warning. so unlike the knowles 
do you also concede he did so deliberately? do you concede there was prosecutorial misconduct is what i'm really asking.
absolutely.
on the individualized, there was something that i didn't grasp. you say we don't know anything about these people, so we have to have that 60-day period to find out about them. the presentence report we're told accompanies the conviction, the prisoner's conviction. so the presentence report will have a fair amount of information about the offender, will it not?
they do have one authority for that proposition. they cite mccarthy, and i think they're right about that.
well, and  if i could just mention one other  on other example, under the theft-offense category in subsection  i think it's (f)  where a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony if a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed. there are misdemeanor offenses there that  as a matter of federal law, it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft offenses; and yet, they are covered as aggravated felonies. and, again, that would 
well, but that may be just a generic use of the term cases.
well, if we don't accept  let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that  that we're having trouble accepting the  the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. you then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of  of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.
well, it  let me back up. the reason i asked with you  when you were referring to the $10 fee is because the intrastate fee  we have a $10 component in that as well. you can obtain a temporary fee for $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation. so the statute in  structurally has some apportionment factor in it. so you don't have to necessarily buy the $100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastate operations.
well, now, wait. he also said  when asked whether he could vote to impose the death penalty, he said, right now i say i can, but tomorrow i might not.
well, your honor, there would be some real consequences that would follow from that.
well, your honor, if i can deal with the traceability part of that question first, traceability is easy to show here because the extent of our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in the air. and being focused on the 20 percent of all u.s. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still a sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or 20 percent is there. in terms of the particular harms, similarly we have shown 
okay, but what  what if the state says, you can enter  enter into interstate activities for nothing? we're simply going to increase the registration fee by $100. couldn't the state do that?
because of being  because of being the triggerman.
well, it is  it is a little unusual to have under your view two different sections, both addressed to the question of the appropriate standard of review in a particular type of proceeding. they seem either redundant or overlapping. the theory on the other side at least distinguishes them and argues that they apply in different circumstances.
but i would 
yes.
i think  because as the petitioners insisted when they pressed for interlocutory appeal, they said these were distinct and severable, because, as justice scalia referred to before, the important question, on a going-forward basis, is whether the current set of activities  this software, given how it operates, being generally distributed  is a vendor's  the distributor of that software  secondarily liable because somebody else, tomorrow, can do exactly the same thing, without the baggage of any past acts.
so then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement. it's saying because of this parallel conduct, because we think it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they have agreed.
in any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it 
so  so you could have appendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary jurisdiction, applicable in diversity case, was not changed at all by 1367(a). i think that's what you're saying.
he's not on the end of a phone line. he's in the room across the kitchen table.
then you are, in effect, saying that the u.s. rules the world. even if the home port, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says we  we don't require our ships to take care of the handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the other ports say, what the u.s. law is is going to govern because practically if you're going to design the ship to meet the u.s. requirements, you're not going to rip those out when the ship goes elsewhere.
well, i guess we can ask the respondents. but is it your understanding that respondents take the position that the state has no control at all over whether or not the shares have been properly issued, whether or not certain accounting requirements applicable to all corporations have been complied with?
 i'm looking at the 
this court in holbrook dealt with the same situation, and the court in that case held that when a procedure presents such a probability of prejudice that it is inherently lacking in due process, little stock need be placed in jurors' claims to the contrary because jurors may not even be conscious of the effects that shackling will have. and at that point in the proceedings, the jurors had not been instructed as to what specific factors they would be looking at. they did not know that missouri has four steps in their sentencing procedure. they did not know how this would play into it. so their response that they would not be affected really should have little bearing here.
yes.
and the fact that you described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me cuts against you.
i don't think so in this case because the police report is in  in a police file itself.
but it's within the realm of what courts have done for the longest of the time. they look at documents attached. they look at judicial notice.
the 
well, your honor, what we would say is that this court's jurisprudence is that in applying a rational basis test, one doesn't look at what the legislature said was the purpose of the statute, but one looks at what could be advanced as a purpose for the statute and 
can we explain that? how does one use a newspaper as a weapon? i mean, you know, maybe disciplining a dog or something. (laughter.)
wouldn't the washington supreme court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?
so we're going far  far beyond a void subject matter like usury. but you could say there  there wasn't sufficient consideration. there was no mutuality or things that go to the formation of a contract.
but are  are the people here charged with any sort of terrorist activities? they were committed  convicted of crimes, but i  i didn't think they were connected with terrorist activities.
they did describe the entire episode to him, justice ginsburg.
yes, and i think  that's exactly my point. what (e) says is that this act does not apply  and i'm quoting now  "this act does not apply when the claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years." that strikes us  you can call it "limitations" if you want, but it strikes us as a very powerful one. because it restricts the government's ability to bring such a case 
but i think, justice roberts  i think, mr. chief justice  i apologize. because my time is running short, i would say the key point in this case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in the ninth circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing and argument, and it was denied. that was the point at which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase "this is patently wrong," would likely in most circuits before most panels have lost. and this matter would have gone back to the state court 2-1/2 years before it got affirmed by the ninth circuit and five years before today. unless the court has any further questions, i think i've completed my comments.
the trial  the trial court would find for the plaintiff because under the title vii formula, which this court has established in the mcdonnell douglas/furnco line of cases, the finding of a prima facie case entitles the plaintiff to a presumption.
and he goes on to write as if it isn't that automatic. and he then favors you because he says the standards set out in gregory and gay, as if they aren't different.
no, i know, but didn't we have in front of us a limit, which i wrote was rather border, that involved a state auditor campaign?
it  are  are you bound by a finding in the state court that there was no exaction, or was there no such finding?
but if that's 
the trial court said each of the three standing alone was sufficient. but what the court of appeals said is these other two have been challenged, but these other two are  we're not going to deal with this challenge to these other two factors because they're out of the case. so i think that this court has to take the case as coming from  coming from the washington courts as if what the courts essentially said is those other two are not in the case any more.
were there any prisoners, since the inception to your program, that have been in there for the whole 2 years?
no. no. once you 
if the 
i agree, justice ginsburg, is  it is a federal question as a common sense matter and every other way. it does not follow that it should be decided and adjudicated by a federal court. state courts can and do 
correct. that would make a difference.
right.
on the other side of the circuits, we count three; on the states, we count 14. some states have not addressed the issue.
you would have no problem, i assume, if the state simply requires that you name the individuals?
don't you think there's a grammatical difference in the meaning of the word obvious and the meaning of the word apparent?
well, it was  when it was originally enacted, justice stevens, it was supported by both the commerce clause and, of course the 
on one hand, in one case, the unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by the jury. but in the federal system, it does not require that finding by a jury.
that's absolutely correct, mr. chief justice. of course, as this case comes to the court, all agree that chatham county is not an arm of the state for purposes of this court's constitutional sovereign immunity doctrine. so the only issue in this case is whether there is some other ground on which the county would be entitled to immunity, and there's none. respondent's theory is that there are two distinct notions of sovereign immunity, what it calls eleventh amendment immunity and what it calls residual sovereign immunity. a fundamental flaw in that theory is that there is only one doctrine of  of constitutional sovereign immunity. what respondent calls residual sovereign immunity and what this court has sometimes identified as the immunity associated with the residuary sovereignty that comes from federalist 39 is the doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity.
well, that's 
i think 
oh, oh.
in thompson, your honor, the difference is that  that the litigant was sent down a different road which was inconsistent with his filing a notice of appeal. here there is nothing inconsistent about filing a notice within 14 days as opposed to 17 days.
well, it actually depends  you get into statistical approaches, but if, let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated.
 i think you could say that all of those voluntariness factors should be looked at, in terms of initiation, although i just think the analysis would be exactly the same as if you were asking whether he made a voluntary waiver, that it's the same voluntary  voluntariness analysis. now, in the 
do you read the tenth circuit opinion as indicated it might have had a different result if he had been married before the enactment of the statute?
no, your honor, because in the  in the previous page, the prosecutor did state that it was a catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates everything, but  and the prosecutor's argument, that, "i'm not sure if it fits in there," signifies that there  not that the evidence  that such evidence could not be considered as mitigating as a  in a general matter, but that  just that the religious evidence in this case was extremely weak, to the point of having, as a practical purpose, no mitigating value. the prosecutor followed that comment. i'm not sure it fits in there, in next breath, with, "it's"  something to the effect of, "it's no secret that belmontes' religious evidence is pretty shaky here," and went on to conclude that. but then, in the next breath, he said, "but, nonetheless, this is something that's proper for you to consider." and, again, reasonable jurors, hearing this  having been given the instruction here  would reasonably interpret this  all of this evidence as something they could use to extenuate the gravity of the crime. and particularly in this context, because, like in boyde, in addition to this factor (k), the standard instruction directed the jurors to consider all the evidence. the first factor of the enumerated factors  (a) through (g), in this case  told the jurors that they should  that they should focus on  that the first thing to consider was the  or the circumstances of the crime itself. the final factor, therefore, that any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime would clearly be understood to relate to matters outside the crime itself. and, to the extent that there was any ambiguity about the meaning of that in this particular case, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction here, clarified that to the point that there is certainly no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they were constrained in considering any mitigating evidence in any way they thought fit.
a potential potential? i mean, every risk is potential, isn't it?
 neither before the verdict nor after the verdict, does any appellate court say, "since no motion was made, we have  we have no power to reverse the judgment here, but our examination of the case indicates that there was really not sufficient evidence to go to the jury. and, therefore, we will do the lesser thing and grant a new trial"? does any court of  appellate court do that?
did they  did they search the individuals too to make sure 
you wouldn't have been able to tell the jury, "i was standing next to the chair, because if i had  i obviously would have gotten away from the chair, because i knew that's where the gun was."
 your honor? yes. well, one would  i quite agree.
well, there's no 
it's slightly more than 20 
i believe that's true, justice o'connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements. they do not receive formal security clearances the way that an employee does. and unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad swath of classified information that raises attendant counterintelligence concerns. and so if you think about the course of dealing that the agency has with its employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in court under, for example, title vii, and the agency can turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like the prepublication review agreement that was issue  at issue in this court's snepp decision. so in the employment context, i think it's very difficult to say that there's an implied term of the employment contract that either side will not have judicial recourse.
well, the government did not appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact 
yes, your honor, i think so.
may i ask a question at this point going really back to the question i asked you at the outset of the argument? if i thought seniority or years of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if i thought this particular compensation program was based on years of service rather than age, can i look at the reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your complaint states a cause of action?
all right. and you cite matsushita for that?
yes, but until  until white v. illinois basically let the guard down, these  these statements could not come  accusatory statements that might have been in present sense impressions did not  were  were not the basis for prosecutions. once  once white v. illinois was decided, then  then courts allowed them in routinely.
okay, but that's  that's true.
no, your honor. the  the decision, once the joint venture took effect, as to how the products would be priced, was simply an allocation of the profits of the joint venture. there's no actual competition between texaco and shell. that was simply the formula for determining 
yes.
i just 
certainly not the totality, and if you say, well, this statement was informal, it  it doesn't make sense and i think it conflicts with a comment in crawford in footnote 3 to say, well, informal testimony is  is okay, as the court said in  in crawford. if  if sworn out-of-court testimony is invalid, it wouldn't make sense to say that unsworn testimonial statements are perfectly okay. now, so far as the principle that  that because the witness is under agitation, the  the confrontation clause doesn't  doesn't apply, i don't think that's  that's valid at  at all. it certainly isn't valid historically. if  if it were, we would have seen examples over history in which agitated declarants  their statements came in. but as  as general dreeben has indicated, the very  the very organizing principle of prosecution was that the accuser must come and  come and testify.
no matter what? okay, suppose they repeal chapter 13 before you convert. then can you convert?
well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all i can say is that perhaps an argument could be made  and perhaps mr. phillips will make the argument on rebuttal  that it is fairly included within the questions presented.
okay, but he did not do so.
the  well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. it found that, in this case, the mark was being used  sorry, that my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good faith. the ninth circuit 
right. and obviously, ordinarily courts would not be doing that. it's a very inefficient thing to do in the ordinary course. but here, where the transcript does reflect the court actually considered, on the one hand, the defendant's need for additional time and, on the other hand, the interest in trying  trying criminal cases sooner rather than later and balanced them by granting a lesser 
they say that that provision only applies when there is no sip. and that's official not this case.
i don't know, your honor, whether a title search would reveal it, but certainly in the county records, all of the delinquent properties are entered and open to the public for inspection. they may have to look in two different places.
no. i'm just talking about as a general matter if we're trying to decide the issue not just on these facts, but what is the better rule 
yes. reasonableness is the touchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial courts in selecting among the three terms, and that would be a perfectly 
absolutely, your honor.
 that correct?
 i take it that their point was, what you sort of said there, that  that they had agreed  sorry. forget it. (laughter.)
right, because you won't let them in. now, sometimes you'll have to dismiss the entire case.
 probably allowed?
i think that the question that would be required then was for whoever was filing the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the docket is. if that's ambiguous, i think it's obligatory on the litigant to err on the side of caution, your honor.
yes, justice stevens. the randolph case was decided in 1903 and the law changed dramatically since then. for example, in 1903 contingent claims were not provable under the bankruptcy act. that changed in 1938 when contingent claims became provable under the bankruptcy act. randolph & randolph versus scruggs involved the claim of a custodian, a custodian, an assignee, who took control of all the debtor's assets before the bankruptcy filing. now under section 503(b)(3)(e), the randolph versus scruggs analysis as it pertains to the claims of the assignee, those are now treated as an administrative expense under section 503 dealing with administrative expenses. in randolph, it's interesting, the fees  justice kennedy, the fees incurred in preparing the assignment were allowed as an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case. justice holmes for the court said they are allowed. so in fact randolph i think refutes their analysis rather than supports it.
well, no, he believes it.
but he gave the very same example that was griggs. he gave the example of the high school diploma because he thought that people of a certain age, when there wasn't such general education as there is today, might not have a high school diploma to a much higher extent than the people who came  the generation who came after.
sure.
we were almost alone in having suppression as the remedy.
 the court.
yes.
no, you don't because then the warrant shouldn't have issued.
there was no evidence of that, your honor, in our review.
i think, starting in semayne's case, the court recognized that even if the officer would have a right to knock down the door after a refusal of entry was obtained, that if the officer did not wait for that refusal, then the entry was illegal. and so, i think the common law cases do support  the old english common law cases, starting with semayne's case  do support the notion that the entry  the entry does become illegal if the officer does not wait for the refusal. and in this case, of course, the officer did not wait at all for any refusal, candidly admitted that he went in as soon as he could get through the door, as quickly as he could.
but if the  i don't think  i think that whenever there is a straddle crime and that the charging document is 
well, i suppose there are a lot of other violations of constitutional rights by the police that are very hard to get at, and that cannot be remedied. and i suppose we could punish them by excluding all the evidence, as well. we don't do so, simply because there's no causality. we insist upon a causal connection between the two. it's not enough just to say the  this is the only way to stop the police from making the violation.
did you think that?
she did not  she did not relay that to the officer. that came from mr. randolph, in his testimony at the suppression hearing. all 
or do we have to reject it all out of  out of hand?
our argument is not based on the timing of the objection, so it has nothing to do with when he did or didn't raise his objection. and so 
he's not talking about the deciding of issues; he's talking about reversing a judgment. you don't have to go into what the issues are in order to follow that instruction. the judgment is reversed. and if there were issues that should have been resolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that weren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be to say to the court of appeals, "well, the supreme court didn't mean what it said," or, "didn't know what it was doing," but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.
but if the  but if congress, justice scalia, had thought that that catchall phrase covered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended the statute in 1994 to add them specifically.
price fixing, horizontal, i guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too.
we have 
and all taylor and the armed career criminal act are interested in is what was he convicted of.
true. but, in the '90s, you had a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on wall street that did affect holders in a unique way. and we've highlighted market timing in our briefs. in that circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get together and assert that they had been harmed by market timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small that you really have to look at it in a large context. john vogel, the head of vanguard for many years, and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and hold, as we've been taught to do by wall street, but whose aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market timing. that is a unique harm caused to holders, which, under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to redress that. there's 
 206 through 208, your honor, i might agree. but they construed 201(b) and commented on the consequence. and this is quite important, that it is their business, because 208 is the provision under which each and every one of those commission proceedings cited in the sprint brief, which mr. fisher alluded to, has proceeded before the agency. 208, just like 206, requires a violation of the act, so it is very much their business to decide whether these pay phone controversies state violations of the act. if they don't, the commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208, which is the only provision under which any administrative proceeding has ever gone forward. there are some arguments made here that they clearly have the authority to proceed administratively even if you can't go to court, but mr. fisher hasn't official identified the source of that authority. and the sources identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been problematic, and others  and other sections on which the fcc has never relied on in this setting, and some kind of divination of an action within section 276 itself. the question was put at one point to mr. fisher, could the fcc mandate fee-shifting as part of this administrative remedy it's going to create. well, if you read 276 broadly, it's giving the commission great powers to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208, which was supposed to be the administrative provision, then maybe anything goes. but we're getting awfully far from the statute that congress wrote and giving the fcc awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also denying the fcc rather mundane powers to construe rather ordinary phrases of administrative law, "unjust or unreasonable," in 201(b). now, with respect to the question of whether this is a practice in connection with a communications service, mr. fisher argues strenuously that it is not.
we are talking 
so, it suggests that we shouldn't give too much weight to that.
no, it does not remain in her possession. the chapter 13 trustee technically never has possession. the title remains vested in the chapter 13 trustee.
do you, do you concede  do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?
right.
but what's the  i'm  as justice scalia, i'm interested in the section 25 problem. the briefs 
your honor, congress put 506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to allow claims that are not elsewhere allowed, because if it doesn't do that 506(b) serves no purpose at all. 506(b) says nothing at all about whether the claim is secured.
you can plate wherever you have contacts with the state. if your principal place of business is in ohio but you have trucks going to and from michigan, that  that would allow you to plate in state of michigan.
yes, i  i agree. it's not exactly identical, but we're very close to  to that point in penry. beyond that, the prosecutor did argue vociferously that the jury should  in its determination, should be concerned about whether or not bill payton is going to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect, argued dangerousness, which was appropriate. but if the jury  he also argued that the jury couldn't consider evidence which plainly pointed to his lack of dangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his conversion to christianity. so, in effect, the prosecutor was able to argue its side and  and the jury wasn't able, when you get to the harmless error analysis, to argue its side. and that's what makes this, it seems to me, a very strong showing that  that harmless error  that the error in this case is not harmless. it had a clearly important effect.
but the debtor could argue in the context of the motion to convert, well, i would like to propose a chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct wasn't that severe, and the court can take that into consideration allowing the debtor to proceed. but where as here you have a clear case of abuse, the court should be entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular point in time. allowing the court to senselessly say, "oh, go ahead and convert  "
okay. but because the instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory negligence really should have been denied. is that correct?
yes, your honor.
with respect, justice souter, i don't think that it would be a good idea for this court to get on a path of starting to second-guess congress' judgement about defining a class of activities 
ms. brinkmann, may i stop you there, because i thought you have conceded, as i think you must, i thought you conceded quite clearly, i wrote down that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. so, if it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?
 activity.
right? if the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can  can take a late, a late filing?
there was a disagreement about whether or not his memorandum accurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was at issue there. there was a disagreement about the content of the allegations.
but either way, the outcome should be the same because emotional distress is not a standalone claim. he has to establish that he had rights to make and enforce a contract that were violated, and even if he did that, he still has to show that the damages that  that were caused by domino's were sufficiently direct to be cognizable.
if the tribe has sovereign  sovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably the city can't tax it. so we have to decide that, do we?
we 
based upon the officer's testimony at the suppression hearing, your honor, it would be that did they not have a serious intention to harm him is the fact that, one, there was nothing showing that they were actually doing anything more than restraining them, that juvenile. there's nothing in the record that shows that they were beating on him, that they were molesting him, or you know 
that's not the way the decisions, if you read them and read the evidence, that they work. but it's  i mean, it  it does  if the judge weighs and conditions the admissibility of evidence of innocence on the ability to overcome  and that's the south carolina rule, overcome the prosecution's case and overcome it with a stacked deck where any of the defendant's counter-evidence is irrelevant, it's impossible. a defendant could never overcome it.
i had the same question as justice ginsburg, and i think was also suggested by justice scalia's question. suppose that congress passed a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million dollars to the president to use to call religious conferences, and then it spelled out these conferences. is there standing there?
there's no doubt he's the target. that's the 
but 
but only  is it  it's not just when there's the equivalent of the guilty plea, but any major trial strategy 
well, the supreme court would have the option of granting cert to review whatever the texas courts 
they  very different grounds most  most commonly, your honor. that is, you can  there can be completely sufficient evidence to support the jury winner's verdict 
well, then you are asking us, i guess, not only to reject bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the commerce clause remains alive and well? was it justice stewart? and i forgot which case it was. it was 
with an i or an e?
well, we  we have a different kind of trend. what do you make  you spoke of a consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the last, i guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual imposition of the death penalty for  for those whose crimes were  were under 18 has  has steadily been dropping. i think 10 years ago, there were 13. last year, i  i think the figures were that there were two. the  the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as  as the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been occurring at a time when  when treating juvenile crime seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. what  what are we supposed to make of that?
well, we believe that we are entitled to  clearly, under the 
the  the, the statute that you point to talks about taking a civil action against the united states. when there has been a wrongful levy, is that right?
can you tell us why  why is it still live when they  when they already received a second hearing? or why is not moot?
whether congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a federal reservation, which it certainly did for glacier, did it not?
and i believe that question, your honor, is answered by pennsylvania coal where the court found that the fact that the statute at issue there prevented pennsylvania coal from mining a certain amount of the coal that was in the ground that it was otherwise entitled  be entitled to mine  took that property just as assuredly as a condemnation of it would. and then the court said, but the seemingly absolute protection of the just compensation clause in the context of a  of a regulation that affects that kind of appropriation, as opposed to an outright condemnation of it, that that protection is subject to an implied limitation that exists to allow the government to serve its purposes, as pennsylvania coal described it, if the government could hardly function at all, if it were required to pay for every interference with property rights occasioned by its regulation. so what we have growing out of pennsylvania coal is a  a rationale for allowing the government to interfere with private property rights that would otherwise be protected and otherwise could not be taken without compensation in order that the government may serve its legitimate purposes.
no, you're not.
i thought you would say that the whole principle of, you know, "are you engaged to wait, or waiting to be engaged?" just contradicts the principle that was adopted in steiner. i mean, are you putting  are you employed to put on your  to put on your clothes, or are you putting on your clothes to do your work? and steiner essentially repudiates that. so, you know, let's forget about skidmore.
that  that may be a  a reason for you to appeal on the merits, but i don't see what it has to do with the  with the jurisdiction of the court as  as awarding equitable relief. maybe it did a poor job in deciding what was equitable.
this case come out  no, it would not because the kleypas court found that the kansas  or the kansas death penalty was constitutional as construed. and the kansas court in this case found it unconstitutional on its face. and there is a significant difference, and the court raised the issue again. i would like to point out to the court that there are five ways that a juror can, after their reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death penalty. the juror can state that they have a reasonable doubt as to whether the state has met its burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. the juror can simply delay. kansas law has a defect  default for life in its sentence or in its structure, and i would encourage you to read on page 28 of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable to make a decision  in other words, in a doubtful case  the judge is required by law to dismiss the jury and sentence the defendant to life. and so there is a default for life, and that is another way that a juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision that death is not appropriate. the juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision that is not appropriate by determining that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors. and the juror under instruction number 5 
your honor, i think he was talking about the hope that he has that the states could work more cooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this river between these two states that this court was first asked to resolve interstate river disputes between states in 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this river.
and this 
no, your honor. the longer the period of time you take, the more the accumulated results of the model will match the measured 
why is that? there  it's the same clause. what you can remove is a covered class action involving a covered security. so why do we have such different approaches to the different prongs?
well, because  because 
you're right, justice ginsburg, but i don't think you look only at the end of the statute. it clearly says, if any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provision or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without invalide - sorry  provisions or applications. it seems like they had this case in mind, that there were circumstances in which perhaps some court would say it was unconstitutional to apply it and that's not a basis to strike down the whole statute.
they don't find a 
to  to apply very broadly according to its terms.
diehr, which 
is it  is it  was it in this category, this track category? because it was something new for the employer. there hadn't been a forklift operator. i gather there had only been one before.
 you made a point earlier that the attorney general has never done this before, has never said, "you can't prescribe particular drugs for"  has  that has not been done. you've been giving examples of where the fda ruled that you can't 
that was guidance, your honor.
in the general sense, yes.
so then why weren't those proposed regulations saying just that, adopted?
the result  official
well, what is the standard? am i supposed to apply  am i not supposed to apply graham?
are they in effect yet?
this is not the plumber hypothetical, which is i think quite misleading. no. no, i don't think that even the government will defend that.
see, your traceability either covers every case or it covers no case. in real world taxation terms, no case would ever meet the test. but in, in purely conceptual terms, is any federal money being spent, every case involving any expenditure of money, even the portion of the marshal's salary that is devoted to convening the court in the morning, would be sufficient.
is it your argument that it  under arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct, but not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?
why not?
so, if we wanted to be faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't exclude the evidence.
 resolve this question?
okay. but his  his whole argument is you, state, get exactly what you're entitled to if i win on 60(b) because what i was entitled to and what you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but subject to the rule in artuz. that's all you get, state. and what he is saying is, i want to get back into court so that i can have the statute of limitations  the benefit of the statute of limitations as artuz construed it. that means you, state, get what you want and i get my one chance. how is that an open door to the abuse that you're talking about?
but it was also protectionism  i mean, i didn't agree with this at the time, but i mean there, it  you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar. that, so far as we know, that person or that company was in it for the money. and so for the period of the five years prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that particular entity was being protected so it could make money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a dollar. surely that entity was being protected handsomely.
exactly. and 
but, but this really became clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my answer. in 1999 when congress enacted the gramm-leach-bliley act, it directly addressed this question of affiliates of national banks. and this is on page 2a of our appendix. it refers to, it created a new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature. so they can actually engage in activities that the parent national bank could not. but if you look at the bottom of page 2a of our appendix, this is section 24a now of the act, it said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in activities that are permitted for national banks to engage in directly, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by a national bank. and then at the bottom of 3a and going over to 4a where they actually define financial subsidiaries, they do so by distinguishing them from the operating subsidiaries which had existed for decades. and at the top of 4a you see that the operating subsidiary again engages only in activities that the national banks may engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions. then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, on page 12a of our appendix some additional provisions of glba  actually, that's the gramm-leach-bliley act, glba people call it  said  this is on 12a  that securities activities and insurance activities, activities that have been traditionally subject to state regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by relevant state securities authorities or state insurance authorities. so congress was actually quite specific. i mean, your question is about statutory language. you don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century old, doesn't really get into this. but in this 1999 statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks. congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's insurance, it can be regulated by states. they were specific about that. if it's a banking activity that the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same terms and conditions. and so, going back to the chief justice's question, you have this question of would it be a preempted state preempted state law if it were applied to the national bank when the national bank is making a mortgage loan. not every state law is preempted because not every state law conflicts. but if it does 
i want to know what the superintendent said. as i read it is, he says, look, i don't care if this was protected or not. i'll give you that. it's protected. but the rest of his behavior, the way he treated the principal, what he did, the reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a suspension too, and i'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. so it sounds to me as i read it that the teacher is saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5 days. that's what the superintendent says. now suppose you win your point that you're interested in winning, which you may not or you may. are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5 days, that that should be erased?
no, your honor. imagine that judge put the ten commandments right above his or her bench. that would make some individuals feel like outsiders. of course, many judges have religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious beliefs above them. and your honor, that's not hostility to religion. as this court said in county of allegheny, excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene, when displayed by itself, is not hostility to religion. last year in locke v. davie, this court said that to deny funding through the state of washington for scholarships was not hostility to religion. enforcing the establishment clause is not about hostility to religion. it is about making sure that every person who walks into that courtroom can feel that it's his or her government.
i don't know how many are granted, your honor, but one thing that struck me as i was reading through these cases is that many are granted to the state. and of course, when the state goes to certiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction loss on its side, then the whole process is turned on its head, and many, many times this court has granted certiorari to the state. and that is another problem that happens with this tolling if you read pending the way the state wants you to read pending, because what do we do then? what do people do?
i  i think that when the officer does a full-blown arrest, as was envisioned in atwater, you know that you  the person knows that he or she does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
that gets, if you follow justice scalia's argument, that gets you to, i think to the argument you have made. and that is all right, we have got to look at it pragmatically. i mean, what are the consequences of following a reliability model rather than a cross-examination model? and your argument is consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to defendants, in fact  or more productive of ultimately reliable determinations, in fact. and that i take it is your basic point. so i think you've answered what for all of us is a problem. and that is we don't have a clear analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to consequences, you have got an argument. your friends don't think it is a good one, but that's your point.
so the answer is no.
 but with respect to 
do i understand your brief to say that this constitutional rule that you are seeking would be just for the minority party? i think you said in your brief it doesn't follow like the night the day that because the libertarians must be allowed to do this by the constitution, therefore the democrats and republicans must also have the option to invite anyone into their primaries.
yes, that's what we're talking about.
 under the first amendment.
yes, your honor, there is a very precise parallel here. the corporate income tax imposed by ohio applies to any business that transacts business in ohio, whether or not it has manufacturing presence.
but there  your honor  your honor, in that case, it required a discharge of a pollutant from a point source. the definition of "discharge" in section 401 is much broader.
but then, mr. perry, there's a whole case. see, what's peculiar about this is congress says it's not really preemption. i think justice stevens pointed that out in dabit. it is preclusion. it says this action shall not exist. period. not as a state claim, not as a federal claim. and it wanted the federal courts to monitor that determination. it surely didn't want  if  if the state claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is a non-diverse, no federal question case. i mean, it just seems  if you're going to imagine what congress wouldn't want in the federal court, that would be it.
the  that language in the court's opinion was, after full reconsideration, we're declining to revisit the issue at the dissenter's invitation. we're declining that invitation to revisit the issue. and there's no question that the court discussed it and thought about it, and the dissenters were clearly inviting them 
well, of course, i take it the issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted under 15(a).
justice kennedy, no. here we have  when i say estate plan, i mean the living trust and the will operating together.
that may be a tort, but it's not necessarily a denial of process if the proper place to seek that process was from the court that issued the restraining order.
or the contract hiring the security guards who protect the president, right? they're employed. that's an employment contract.
but how could the commerce clause justify application to a free clinic? i don't understand.
but what this instruction told him 
it was, you know, a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain, certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based.
but what do we know about the dimensions of the florida attempt crime? for example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess burglary tools. does it mean or does it exclude casing the house, walking up and down the street, around the block? when is a step substantial enough to constitute an attempt under florida law?
no.
well, it's not good condition for purposes of ordinary torts. the exception bars a claim against the government for the contents of the package. in your hypothetical, justice breyer, if the toupee were damaged as a result of the package being opened, then you could not make a claim, because that was the content of the mail, but if you fell over the package, that's an ordinary tort, that's a common duty between private persons. so 
 court's precedence 
i mean 
yes, that's why, see, i guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been his reason. i'm not sure what to do about this point in any case, and i understand that you think he wasn't incompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found. the second circuit seemed to think he was incompetent because that was their basis. so i guess if he was, it's excluded, and if he wasn't, it isn't excluded. and i don't know. the second circuit said he was. so maybe you should have another chance to argue this before the second circuit.
well, we thought that  we believe that congress thought of it as the parents because of all the statutory references to the parents' complaint. of course, we don't take the absurd position that the child could not also be a party to those proceedings. but in any event, my point was simply that the express lesesne argument that some courts relied on to suggest that congress consciously decided not to allow parental lay representation, i mean, that argument simply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the provision on which that argument is based, which is 1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best. and, in fact, could suggest just the opposite. i'd like to address a point that respondents have relied on 
it's not enough to know that your action was wrongful? you have to know the particular statute or constitutional provision under which a remedy would be sought?
we have to assume that for purposes of this pleading except insofar as it acknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is satisfied, and i think that the cases of this court and certainly the commentators have been clear the court does not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal conclusion. as the  as the footnotes indicate, that has not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in fact, multiple competitors.
there's the main rule which has a bright line 
we are.
i think the  i think  no, sir, i don't think under  like a 1983 action or a fourteenth amendment exception under section 5, i don't think the immunity would reach that far. i think the county would still be exposed to the liability there under that case law. i don't think you have to do away with what you have under the fourteenth amendment  excuse me  under the eleventh amendment or the case laws thereunder. but i don't think that those  those cases under there define the whole of sovereign immunity of the general principles of sovereign 
the district sued the united states. we intervened.
my understanding of the way this works, justice ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up to the car without  and the dog would alert. my understanding of the way these dogs are trained is that they specifically  that the officer has to walk the dog around the car, the vehicle, first of all.
well, the rule simply says you don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely. and if, it simply says that if the choice is between killing him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the garner factors aren't present. and we find nothing in the law and no reason to create a new exception in the law that says that garner doesn't apply if you're fleeing by vehicle. thank you. we ask that the court of appeals be affirmed.
it seems to me you're  you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than the preemption issue.
uh-huh.
i'm not sure that helps your case. (laughter.)
so this part of your argument depends on our accepting your position on the treaty of fort schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later retrocession, is that correct?
i'd like a yes or no answer.
in that circumstance, yes, your honor.
well, we believe the rule is, is that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement officer or to an agent of the law  of law enforcement 
well, i suppose  i suppose we could say  i just hadn't thought of it. i  i suppose we  we could say that it's not a separate product. i mean, no  no  there's no market for the  for the small micro-component in the tv. you're selling a tv.
well, in fact  no. but the  the answer is that we didn't  no issue was engaged as to what was the functional equivalent of the complaint below. that raised  was raised for the first time by the solicitor general in its merits brief, saying, "no, no, no, there's actually some stuff that comes before the order." but if  i would encourage the court to look at the definitions in fogrsfa, 1724 and 1702(a), which tell you what, under  in congress's view, commences the official proceedings here. and, in congress's view, what commences the proceedings, what triggers the new statute of limitations and stops it from running, is the order to pay, which congress defines as a "demand."
you 
i know in michigan. i'm saying, could michigan change its statutory scheme to kick the feds out? or would that be prevented by this federal statute we're discussing here? i'm trying to see what you think this federal statute does. or what the 
okay, so the question you're being asked is, how can that be narrowed in some fashion to focus on the problem? the statute may well have a majority of valid applications. so how can we narrow the application? and what of our doctrines allow a narrower application? so you need to focus on that. obviously, it's a matter of concern.
thank you. mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the government now concedes that the ninth circuit erred in holding that the negotiated grievance procedure of the civil service reform act strips federal courts of their jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims by federal employees.
 against scarpelli.
that's correct, mr. chief justice.
absolutely false, justice souter. in bankruptcy, if you do not present your rights, if the rights of the workers themselves are not properly treated, they are lost. under section 1141, they are extinguished.
it may be close to the truth. now, we have a case, a hypothetical. the defendant is sitting there, the police say, "question?" and he says, "i want to see my lawyer." and the policeman says the following, "that's fine, go ahead, we'll get him. by the way, if you see him, we'll execute you. are you sure you don't want to talk to us?" that's plainly unlawful, isn't it?
if that's what they intended, then how can a state say, well, it's the union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or the corporation, if they want to spend money that people have given them for totally other purposes, the compulsory bar association, well, they can do that. it's just the labor unions that can't spend the money that these people forced to belong  you know, they have to object affirmatively  but all the other similar organizations, they can't.
dr. gross suggested that there be a 20 follow-up inquiry into  into alcohol, and that 
but  but my  my point was at common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that  that that wasn't even evidence of a  that should  that  that shouldn't allow the suit to go forward because it was a sufficient guard  protection for the prosecutors.
michigan has a particularly vigorous state immunity statute that makes it effectively impossible to sue for a  a knock and announce violation. i have not found a single michigan case in which anyone has successfully sued for a knock and announce violation. you can sue in federal court under section 1983, but there you run into various doctrines, especially including qualified immunity. i made the claim the first time and it still hasn't been contradicted by my opponents. we've not been able to find any cases, published or unpublished, in which anyone has collected anything other than nominal damages anywhere in the united states 
yeah.
and the  and the concern is i think  at least as i understand the  the concern with it, it  it boils down to something like this. somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this  there's something wrong here, and  and federal court should determine the  in fact, the  the claim preclusion of the state judgment should not apply. the answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your state judgment. you don't appeal state judgments in federal court. out. there's no such claim being made here. the only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, i guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the federal case after the state case is over. there's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine. there's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto rooker-feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in federal court, as justice ginsburg says, you  you plead claim preclusion. simple. why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?
that's correct 
in the brief here  well, it's  it surprised me that there were those two cases. but, do you have any notion of how many slip-and-fall, trip-over-mail cases  claims are filed?
the 
but isn't it sort of foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution, but only if you  only if you catch it in advance? that doesn't make sense because if the problem would arise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do, why shouldn't you be denied the permit?
thank you.
maybe they sought to but maybe they didn't succeed. as i read the statute, it  it really applies to the  the limitation of $10 only to those fees that are ssrs fees, and these are not. so maybe there's  there's a hole in the federal statute.
i  i don't think so, justice souter, because i think this court has traditionally allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional claims for injunctive relief to seek that relief. nothing in the csra changed that, and if i can explain why for just a moment, i think it'll be helpful. if you look at this court's opinion in fausto or you look at this court's opinion in bush against lucas or the opinion in karahalios, which i think are the three leading cases from this court construing the civil service reform act in  in this kind of fashion, you'll notice that they repeatedly refer to those acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel actions. personnel actions is not a casual phrase. it is a defined term in the csra. it's defined in section 2302(a), which is  was discussed in the government's brief at page 5, note 5. and you will notice there, if you read it, that they do include  indeed, congress in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing. there was nothing here that turns a drug test into a personnel action. now, the csra is absolutely comprehensive in its field, but its field is personnel actions. and this case is not a personnel action.
where are you?
if you had a situation where you had a ship that  let's say, that began in  in great britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here in the united states, i think that the better view would be, sure, united states law could apply to it because it's in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, with regard to the ada, i don't know why that would be a public accommodation within the meaning of the ada because it's not an accommodation that's offered 
so, in  it seems to me a little strange that this same act is both within the exception and not within the exception, the same act of negligence.
 put to us 
i'm sorry, your honor. we would  we would say that the court ought to say that in agins the court was restating a due process test, and if this is to be a standalone test, it ought to be part of due process. but if it finds a home in the just compensation clause, it ought to find a home in the  in the public use portion of the just compensation clause where if, indeed, the economic impact in a regulatory takings context is so severe that it constitutes a taking, then whether it rationally advances a state goal ought to be  ought to inform the question of whether or not it's a public use, but that it shouldn't be a standalone test for really sitting as a super-legislature to determine whether or not this really advances the government's goals as opposed to whether it could rationally have advanced the 
it may well, but when it comes here, this court is going to have to decide  we'll just approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not prosecute whatever you want?
well, i think that when a  when a litigant expressly waives his rights under an act, that the very natural effect of that is to make the court think he does not have to follow that act and that would include the findings requirement.
the  yes, mr. chief justice. and the transition from suspension of deportation to cancellation of removal would fall into that category. however, the reinstatement provision talks in terms  in categorical terms of any forms of relief from deportation. it doesn't specify the particular types of relief that would be available 
that's correct, your honor.
in the cayuga case, there were two elements of damages. one was retrospective, and that was rental damages for past trespass. the other was a current value, because judge mckern said that he would not evict anyone, and that he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award of value, because it would put the tribe in a position through a free-market and voluntary relationship with purchasers to, quote, "restore its homeland." judge mckern got really to the heart of this process by recognizing that there are inequities all around, if you will, and that the court is without the power to extinguish the underlying rights. it's congress's role, but that there needs to be a sensible way of recognizing those rights today. and what judge mckern decided is that damages would put the tribe in a position to do what the oneidas have done with respect to the land that's at issue here before the court, and that's to make, you know, a fair-and-square deal and pay full value.
i mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. i mean, it  it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.
that's true. that's certainly true. that's why our point is that it's one thing to produce a punishment that can properly be replicated in case after case without producing an excessive total punishment. it's another thing to punish in case after official case for the same harms.
no, your honor.
well, i can understand the argument, that he shouldn't be allowed to raise due process here if the argument also goes to your  the permissibility of your raising 2253.
and  and 
your honor, he gets the basic reason for the classification and that's 
is this 
that's  your honor, that is the base of the decision. it harkens back to what the founders believed. however, the rule in roberts was described variously from "amorphous to unpredictable, proof manipulable," to saying that the basis for the right to confrontation and cross-examination comes from a basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage of an actual adversary proceeding. this case, of course, illustrates the dire need for cross-examination because the accuser in this case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing in this case and then was excused before cross-examination was allowed. the accuser in this case, who was sent to a counselor by the district attorney, when she went to the counselor refused to knowledge that the incident happened, according to the testimony of the counselor. and because the court  and the record is very scant on what happened here  the court, the trial court for instance, under roberts made only a couple of findings and he said the testimony was consistent  he didn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on at least two other occasions  and said it was chronological, at least according to what the police officer said. and so there were only a couple of findings by the trial court at all with respect to 
not very common. not very common, your honor. it would occur in circumstances where there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind of a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal anomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but it's very rare.
i don't know if there is or not but our 
and that's where you start. that's the touchstone. now, the numbers, the relative proportions of use, are relevant. in a case like sony itself, certainly, where the majority use was noninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't need to go further. in a case like this one, where, taking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it must be, and the ninth circuit's assumption that you've got 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of acts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing use, it seems to us it's just 
with respect, justice scalia, i've never heard of an as-applied challenge to a statute that doesn't identity that's unconstitutional as applied. and it's your right 
well, it's 
or maybe 
where no motion has been made 
so what if the attorney general certifies and removes a case in a criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? what happens then?
why did they do that? what's the advantage to them having that subsidiary rather than doing this directly?
i know you did.
well, the problem that bothers me  and i don't know that there's an answer to it  is you have plaintiff. plaintiff goes into state court. he brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. and then he decides he'd also like to go to federal court. he brings exactly the same suit. and here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time. now, i know there are principles from this court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen. they've always bothered me. but now let's take a special instance. the special instance is that in court one in the state, the plaintiff loses. now, what he decides to do is to say to the federal court, we want you to review what they did in the state court. can't do that. right?
but it's a decision that says, "we don't know what should be done." if aggravators define the basis for execution, and mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise verdict says, in so many words, "we don't know which is more important." and kansas says, when the jury comes back and says, "we don't know," that the result should be death. and that is what seems to me inconsistent with the notion of a reasoned moral response.
when you say terminated the title, you mean by the conveyance of all lands?
no, your honor.
but suppose ibm had used the word "computers" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product. now, another company comes along and they produce the same thing, they want to use the word "computer." you're saying that that would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?
 a new trial? the latter.
to be sure.
well, the kansas supreme court thought that 
well, i 
 which is defined in a very narrow statute. kansas 
brower was a roadblock case.
 the controlling test?
so tax revenues are not property, in your view?
this  that's 
that  that's what she testified 17 to, your honor. i'm not 
well, i don't think i would put it that way. i think, again, they don't compete at the point at which the price 
right. and  and naturally, though, your honor, that was denied. the  the admission that the plaintiff relied upon in the post-trial motions was the allegation that this court has jurisdiction under title vii, under the relevant provision.
as it is in nine other circuits.
well, no, the treaty  the court has traditionally accorded deference to the executive's determination, but has not  has not given that 
would you comment, ms. forsman, on your opponent's argument based on 2254(d)?
oh, i think hess 
he's not participating in the navigation of the vessel.
here's what i  here's where i think the test 
they did not say that, but they said while the application is pending. and the state did not address for this court what is pending here if it's not that application from state court.
may  may i ask you to clarify one thing? i take it, at this point, there isn't any question about the  the amounts and ingredients that will be used in  if  if the execution goes forward. but my recollection is that you said that your  your request for a specification of this formula or protocol was denied by florida. did you ever, as a result of your records request or otherwise, get a statement directly from florida to you that the following proportions of chemicals will be used?
isn't it a fair high probability that if you hit someone at that speed that there will be something, either death or serious injury as a result?
but i thought that there was a time in the course of the trial when he told the family members to stop wearing the buttons.
let's try single-count. okay?
absolutely, and i think it has merit here because it's  it's a reason the district attorney admitted that was motivating her strike. it's  it's patently unconstitutional and it taints every other reason she gave.
as i understand the court's holding in hudson against palmer, the fourth amendment does not apply in a prison cell. and 
well, that  we believe that we are entitled to present it under state law, and we think that is the resolution.
i don't do things on the ground 
absolutely.
it is a subjective standard or an objective standard?
yes. we have a case in which we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession. i mean, i understand the facts of this case. and i wanted to ask  i have two questions, mr. kneedler. one of them  the second one, i'd ask that  you were going to mention three different points, one about conviction; you had two other points you didn't get to. i want to learn what those were. but, before that, it seems to me that, when you put the whole statute  all the  all the different statutory provisions together, you really boil down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words "for purpose of this subsection, the term 'drug-trafficking crime' means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act." and if the word "federal" had been inserted before the word "felony" in the statute, would that not make the statute perfectly clear?
that's 
 that allowed for 
that's what they're saying.
well, of course, your honor, if there were no proof of damages, the whole antitrust claim would fail. but i would also say that it seems to me that when a motion is made under rule 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law, that certainly permits the district court to grant a new trial, because it's a lesser remedy. and we see situations all the time 
i mean, we have had a debate here for going on 50 minutes about what tinker means, about the proper characterization of the behavior, the nonspeech behavior. the school's terms in dealing with the kids that morning. the meaning of the, of the statement. we've been debating this in this courtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me however you come out, there is reasonable debate. should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the correct answer is?
mr. blume, before your time is up, i want to ask you one other question. i'm still troubled about whether aedpa applies. and was it argued in any court below? was the question actually ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether aedpa applies or does not apply? as i understand it, it either does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether it was argued. but was it discussed in any of the lower court decisions?
 why the robinson-patman act 
well, you would win 
was it 
we have a case involving standing which says that  you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a  an exercise in the  in the conceivable. and this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable. nobody thinks your client is really, you know, abstaining from tequila down in mexico because he's on supervised release in the united states, or is going  is going to apply  having been deported from the country for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in the  these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. this is just not the real world.
 to use whatever 
the  the juror cards are in the joint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single card lists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors that they never questioned. so we know that these were notations that were placed on the cards by the prosecutors at the time the venires were called. and the interesting thing about these is it's not just race and gender, it's were they fat, did they have a beard, did they have a mustache. if you map up what's noted on these cards with the sparling training manual that said don't take minorities, don't take jews, don't take women, don't take fat people  people who have mustaches and beards don't make good jurors. it's  these prosecutors were not only trained by that manual, they learned their lesson very well. may 
we do.
and  and wouldn't there have been a  a motion to make the pleadings more specific and they would have then come up with a measure of damages, or am i wrong about that?
no, i'm not interested in tests. i'm interested in just the outcome. i just raise the question.
but the  well, in part, because plants are not  have never been designed  remember, we've got 79.6  the secretary of labor told employers for 50 years, "you can set up your plant without fearing that you're going to suddenly be hit with walking time after somebody engages in donning and doffing, even if it turns out to be integral and indispensable." for 50 years, they followed that advice. they set up all of their plants with that expectation. and now this court, if it follows the ninth circuit's lead, will suddenly say, "okay, what you need to go out and find is all of the integral and indispensable activities"  not just donning and doffing  any integral and indispensable activity that you can get a court to buy into, that will start this ever-expanding workday, such that any walking that goes on after that and before you get done with all of these ever-expanding post-doffing activities. then you have the  that's  you know, so you have this broad  and that's why you're going to have these  substantially greater and totally unexpected liabilities on the workplace.
well, either  you would need more on the record there because if the record was limited to what you just said, i don't think there would be a basis for 
he's 30 years old, and the testimony is 40, 50. it says, jury, for 10 years this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years. and that's an effective 
so which crime is it?
i  i'm really very reluctant to  unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's  that that's what the law provides, that the government can show up a hundred years later, and say, "oh, by the way, you owe all this money."
so they find 13 people called gary jones or g. jones in little rock. now, what do they do?
so you're saying you don't believe it. you think there's a different reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real reason. and we have a factual determination that the judge believes that that's the reason or a reason. and under the  the statute, at least that  that's  that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or, under the state's reason, that's presumed to be correct, and you have to show it by clear and convincing evidence.
that's what i thought.
right, but then the question still remains, justice scalia, for it to be a tangible employment action, is it  is it available to the employer to cure, when the purpose of this entire statutory scheme is to avoid litigation and to provide informal mechanisms for protecting the rights of the employee.
not in this circumstance, justice 22 stevens, and  and for this reason. the information that 23 is typically contained in those files  and  and again, 24 i  i want to add some additional information for the  25 for the court on this point. as mr. nolas says, 1 pennsylvania law does require preparation of records, 2 including certain types of information. but as  as is 3 often the case, the  the  in  in practical  and 4 the practical realities are not necessarily all records 5 are equal. so as a matter of practice, in pennsylvania 6 attorneys cannot necessarily  or would not automatically 7 have reason to think these may give them a wealth of 8 information. but in this situation we had counsel seeking to 10 obtain that very same information, in fact, had previously 11 discussed that sort of thing with the family members. and 12 so they at that point would have reasonably expected that 13 they had a fair picture of the defendant's formative 14 years 
pardon?
under 
your answer to that is, there were several hundred pages of records from school and the testing that went on in school that indicated there was something seriously wrong with this guy.
 to make  you see what i'm driving 
well 
and the question is we don't know exactly which of your several statutory provisions it violated, but if it violated one of them, i don't understand. and if he's correct  maybe he misrepresents the law. he tells us, as a matter of state law, if he asked for the wrong lesser-included instruction, but there is a correct one, the judge has a duty to give the correct instruction. that's what  what the counsel has told us. and if that's right, i don't understand why he wasn't entitled to some lesser-included offense instruction.
is it the same, the same arguments in the 
if the court 
prior decisions of the court suggest that that would most likely be the  the standard. it may be 
that particular aspect was referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of this. prior to trial, the judge did rule that the dr. miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be judged under the per se rule. so certain aspects with respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences in discounts  i mean, developed that much.
well, in 
 in size.
again, the office  if the officer did it under those circumstances, it's for the finder of fact to decide whether it was done for a legitimate purpose or 
then  then you 
what the second circuit held was that if the plaintiff pleads that they were a direct target  and here, other competitors in the market like colonial, alimar, friedel, and easton steel, could plead exactly the same thing that they, in fact, were the direct target. and under the second circuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a motion to dismiss and proceed the parties into protracted discovery. and what the court in associated general contracting and in holmes made clear was that the courts were not designed to be the forums for this kind of long, arduous fact-finding mission in order to determine whether or not indirect injuries should be compensable with treble damages under the rico statute.
in the morning he wasn't in school.
the difference is that the immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a line of court of appeal cases  a majority, not a unanimous majority, never blessed by this court  which suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you don't spend a dollar, you walk away  so important that you are entitled to an immediate 
if there's more, they could bring it out at trial, could they not? the difference between your position and mr. verrilli, i take it, is that you think there should be not summary judgment for the petitioners, but a trial.
no, your honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.
well, it would be assigned job duties, things that normally the employer would take into consideration for things like terminating or promoting. i'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
what  what he's saying is treat me as a sole proprietor. yes, i created this corporation so i can be insulated from liability, but this is a one-person show and so i am bringing a 1981 claim and say forget the corporation. i'm the only human that's involved in this activity.
that's correct.
 insofar as what i've said with respect 
despite the lack of evidence in the record and the fact that district court did not consider that evidence, the sixth circuit dismissed all of those claims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on the plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop that record. i also want to say 
 that congress chose to remove the clarity of the prior provision is of no significance?
well, what it  what it asserts is that, "we've done an audit, and the audit has raised the following issues"  that's why it's called an "issue letter"  "please provide an explanation." and it  so, at that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it is, in fact, asserting a claim. it's not  and it's not requesting relief, which a complaint definitely does. all it's requesting is information to help the agency assess the issue.
yes, your honor. in fact, during the 1980's the united states complained to mexico about the fact that american citizens had not received consular notification, and through the result of those diplomatic discourses, they negotiated an  a agreement whereby american citizens were brought back to the united states for custody. but significantly there, the  the united states didn't take the position that those convictions were unlawful or could be set aside under the vienna convention. they simply, through diplomatic discourse, the traditional means of enforcing a treaty, provided for the  the transfer of these citizens back to the united states to serve out their custody. the  the traditional rule in international law is that treaties don't create individually enforceable rights. many treaties, by their terms, do expressly contemplate private enforcement in domestic courts. look at article 28 of the warsaw convention. look at article 2, subsection 3 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. these treaties do expressly contemplate that theirs  their provisions will be individually enforceable in the domestic courts. it would have been 
 but your argument is, you know, "it's inconceivable that they would have meant that." but, my  they said it in 1519 
maybe there are not 
 arguments are 
 that the jury in this very case understood that, given the questions that were asked?
just costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, yes. it is 
yes, but once again, the reasonableness aspect is not what makes the system constitutional. it is the mandatory versus advisory aspect. and again, that's what made the federal system constitutional based on this court's booker decision. it wasn't this engraftment of reason  reviewing these sentences for reasonableness.
isn't that what the government pressed at the sentencing hearing?
he was wrong. he was wrong. the issue of preemption under slusa can be raised by the defendants on remand in the state courts. it can be litigated. it's important to note that the removal provision says, shall be removable. it's at the defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the federal court to test whether slusa preempts the case or to keep it in state court for the state court to apply slusa and thereby hold that the class action would be unsustainable.
well, of course, the officers  once that warrant was obtained, officers would have to enter the apartment in order to conduct a search 
now, let's 
why? what does that have to do with the theory of sovereign immunity?
i'm not sure 
that's right. but justice  justice ginsburg's point  i take it to be a more particular one. it's true that our law will have consequences abroad, but it is not the case that the u.s. rules the world.
yes, i am, your honor, and i'll get to that right now. there was ample opportunity. there were three hearings. and in fact, there was disagreement between the sides as to whether or not there was this opportunity for a strickland hearing. we don't have strickland hearings 
mr. eastman, assuming for the moment there is no due  procedural due process right here, on the facts of this case, does colorado law provide any alternative remedy for mrs. gonzales?
but the way you stated the rule, if i heard you correctly, you're contending that merrell dow was incorrectly decided.
i think that may be beyond my expertise, justice scalia. the  of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course, because there is not an exemption beyond that. and that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. in addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services, because jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not subject to the exemption. so it really looking at what 552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that  at the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as well. and the department has taken that position. it says this is, in fact, the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption. it applies more broadly than that to coverage as well. so i think in all those senses, justice kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 deals with a number of other subjects. now, one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which i'm sorry  i don't have the right page number here  it is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition  has, carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home of the employer that justice ginsburg referred to. but then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers. and the one thing we know from the department of labor submissions to congress in 1974 and also from what the department has said before this court is that that term at the time was defined by the department and known by congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner. there was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but were employed by a third party agency. now somewhere underlying all of this question, i think, is statutory interpretation and indeed all of respondent's arguments against deference to the department is a basic underlying premise, which is that congress really would not have wanted, even if it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties. and i would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that congress would have wanted that. first of all, third participate employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which congress was trying to assist with this exemption. people who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves. agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the background screening for employees. they can provide necessary paperwork, filing social security documents and things like that. so, in fact, for congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual.
all right. now, did you raise the exhaustion claim? did the government raise it in the lower courts?
we don't believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we're doing it year by year. we'd simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are  are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need it.
i think that is absolutely correct, and indeed rule 9(b) has been an entry qualification since 1938. but there are entry qualifications, and there are entry qualifications. in this case, in effect, the motion to dismiss operates as a dispositive motion. it cuts off the ability to proceed at all, and it does it, if you listen to the standards being proposed by petitioner, and by the united states 
sorry.
may i ask you a practical question about what is currently before the court? mr. casey i think told us that the halbert case is on for the october 8th conference. if we should grant cert in either of those direct from the michigan supreme court  michigan supreme court following bulger, so you always leave before then. if we should grant in either of those cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case till those are decided?
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the court of appeals exceeded its jurisdiction and misconstrued the clean air act in holding that epa was required to define the term "modification" identically for the separate nsps and psd programs, and on the jurisdictional point i'd like to address the whipsaw question, because in fact it's quite official clear that there's no whipsaw issue here for a number of reasons. it's true that there are those ambiguous and cursory 1981 statements from mr. reich, who was a subordinate official within epa. in 1988, the administrator of epa, the head of the agency, in the wepco decision, the applicability determination, made very clear what epa's position is on the application of the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this is an annual tons per year test. that's page 44 of the joint appendix. he made that perfectly clear and it has always been clear that that is, in fact, the epa's official position beginning with the 1980 preamble. but again 
well, that's symbolic speech. i'm talking about actual speech. what expression is the university  real, you know, words  - words  is the 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: there are three basic reasons that a procedural default rule should not be read into the plra. the first is, the text of section 1997(e) is most naturally read as requiring simple exhaustion, which is satisfied once  when there are no remedies available at the time the suit is filed.
what about the  you  you said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the district court correcting its own errors. but it isn't usually  60(b) was framed with the idea of the district court being the very first instance court. and here you will have the district court as the third going up the ladder. so  and  and given that the habeas rules say that  that civil rules are applicable but have to be modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.
right, but the  the question is what was the statutory authority for that part of  for the first part of ancillary jurisdiction, which is the bringing in of the third party defendant. and that's what 1367(a) does in the diversity context. if i could reserve the balance of my time, justice stevens.
thank you.
 it also 
he got what artuz said was an erroneous view of the statute of limitations.
doesn't, doesn't the statute specifically provide for  for exactly this possibility? doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have a saving other remedies clause?
well, let  let me ask you about professor davenport's theory. he filed a  an amicus brief here saying that the contingency fee or the attorney's fees should be capitalized as a transaction cost increasing the basis of the property which was the claim in the lawsuit.
no, your honor, it does not.
yes, your theory is basically that the exception just deals with bad things that happen to the mail.
is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? have they said that, that  we have a  a discretionary appeal, but every  in every case it's a merits decision? we don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.
21a of our opening blue brief.
yes. the prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him  says, you cannot legally consider this evidence. it does not fall within (k), and the judge never corrects it. why is there not a  a reasonable likelihood of  of jury mistake?
if this court concluded in the whorton case that watershed did not survive aedpa, then of course you're right, watershed doesn't  can't get us home here. but as this case comes to the court, as i understand it, this court is considering this case in a posture that it really dealt with in horn versus banks where it said that even post aedpa, what a court is supposed to do is conduct what this court termed a threshold teague inquiry as to whether teague is satisfied. and of course in horn, this court mentioned the watershed exception itself. official so we think that what this court should really do is address that threshold question to the extent it needs to holistically. if there are no more questions, i'll reserve the remainder of my time.
if that were really the case. in a case like this, it would be clearly pretextual, because not only  not only was that not the basis that was actually offered, but the employer sided with him initially and released the defendant and said he had a legitimate basis for speaking, and called a meeting with the sheriff's department, and took all these steps to show that they actually sided with him. and only when the sheriff's department accused him of  as acting like a public defender and said, "we're going to get sued if you don't back us up," then the office changed its position and went against ceballos. so, in a case like this, it would clearly be pretextual. in another case, however, it would not  presumably there are cases where it would not be pretextual.
there was an annual review, but the committee that they set up to review it, made up not of law professors, but made up of correctional officials, said 
that's right. but there  you would  you would often have factual issues in connection  maybe not "often"  you would sometimes have factual issues in connection with a motion to dismiss which might transform it, in effect, into a motion for summary judgment when there is an exhaustion defense raised by the prison. and that might be an example  i think that would be a rare case, but that might be an example of where that would happen. i do want to respond to respondent's reliance on the oscar mayer case. the distinction between oscar mayer and this case is that that case did not involve an exhaustion provision. the court explicitly stated, in oscar mayer, that the provision at issue, a provision of the adea, does not stipulate an exhaustion requirement. the requirement was one of commencement. it obligated the claimant to go to a state administrative agency, wait 60 days, and then he was free to go into federal court. exhaustion requires a claimant to go to an agency and complete his remedies. in oscar mayer, the court relied on features of the provision at issue there that are not present here, and it said, correctly, that the provision at issue there had the purpose of providing a claimant with a limited opportunity to obtain relief in the state administrative process. the plra exhaustion provision was enacted to give the prison a full and fair opportunity, not a limited opportunity, to provide relief before a prisoner is entitled to go into federal court.
i mean, maybe.
of the  the actual wording of this instruction?
that's correct. and it's sort of interesting that neither the petitioners, the united states, or any of the amici have cited a california whistle-blower statute that would have been applicable to this claim. i, frankly, think that there was one that potentially might have been applicable, not cited by any of the parties, but the law was in flux, and it really wasn't all that clear. and that's  and california's probably one of the better states, in terms of whistle-blower protections, compared to  and we're talking about a local government employee, and the odds of protection  it's just hit or miss across the country.
it seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. unless you take that language, the reference to contract in section 2, as referring to two separate things, the contract without the  without the arbitration clause and the arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2 doesn't make any sense.
 combination.
no, your honor. we would suggest that this court's jurisprudence indicates that that type of a claim of a taking ought to be analyzed under the penn central test where you first do look at the extent of the economic devaluation, if you will, of the property and you look at whether there is an interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations 
yes, yes.
well, given that this issue arises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems overwhelmingly likely that any grand jury would have found probable cause.
well, with the caveat that the statute does apply both 
 if that's the case, then of course it's going to be pretty tough 
okay.
all right. now, if that's so 
i wonder if that's a correct statement. it seems to me there are a lot of cases in state courts. in 1983, cases are subject to state court jurisdiction, where the plaintiffs are trying to enforce a federal right.
your honor 
gee, there's less here than meets the eye.
this is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. it is also 
i don't believe you can do it under a general contract 
no, your honor. i think the courts are  are  the federal courts are capable of telling the difference between an application for state post-conviction relief on the one hand and a motion for leave to file an application on the other hand. in fact, the seventh circuit in  in the smith v. walls case and the tinker v. ward case that we cited in our brief had exactly that distinction between an indiana rule which had a prefiling requirement and an illinois rule 
well, i think the  the market will take care of the problem. the question is under what standards are you going to apply. are you going to say that there is no effective check on the jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to implement it against the backdrop of what congress specifically provides, which is that the district courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding how best to proceed.
and justice scalia's question  i'm interested in this. it couldn't arise. that is, a person who files his state collateral petition more than 365 days after the finality of the state court direct review, that person is out of luck under anybody's interpretation because more than a year has passed since it became final, i.e., the state direct review. am i right or wrong about that? that's what's puzzling me.
yes, justice stevens. justice stevens, and may it please the court: i have three basic points. first, section 1367 does not alter the requirements of section 1332 for original jurisdiction in a civil diversity action, and therefore, the plain language of section 1367 does not alter the complete diversity requirement or the requirement that each plaintiff in a diversity action must have more than $75,000 in controversy. second, there is no sound basis for distinguishing between the two jurisdictional requirements of section 1332, and therefore, if section 1367 alters the matter-in-controversy rule of zahn and clark, it also alters the complete diversity rule of strawbridge. and third, the best interpretation of section 1367 and the one that causes the least harm is that it overturns the result in finley and otherwise, with a few exceptions, codifies the pre-finley understanding of supplemental jurisdiction. now, our  our primary argument has already been addressed, and i don't want to waste time on it but it is crucial, critical to our argument. and that is, that the language of 1367(a) is that supplemental jurisdiction is conferred but only in a civil action, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.
well, 1964(a) addresses equitable relief, and the government can get things like disgorgement under (a). but as far as damages are concerned 
with or without under mississippi law 
it's clear it's not sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible evidence?
that is what he was getting at but at a limited point in time, and the whole question for equitable tolling purposes was at what point in time. nobody argues that the third circuit still is making everybody go back and do it no matter what. what the petitioner argued was that the third circuit case law, as of 1997 when he was first starting his second round of post-conviction review in state court, as of that time, he says, the third circuit case law said you have to go back no matter what even though pennsylvania has a  this new statute of limitations. that's not what the third circuit says, though. and all the cases that the petitioner relies on primarily  he cites a  a case called doctor, a case called banks, a case called lambert. all of those cases were decided before the pennsylvania courts began applying the new jurisdictional time bar in state court.
yes, not just the same part of the state, but a part of the state that falls within the section 2  within the focus of the plaintiffs' section 2 claim, and a part of the state that's marked by its high concentration of minority citizen voting age population. in  in the de grandy case, this court confronted a very similar problem where you had one part of the state, the miami-dade area of florida, which had a high concentration of hispanic citizen voting age population, and the state was drawing various districts in that part of the state. and the court looked to those districts and considered whether there was a proportional representation of the minority group in that area and  and found that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was, and therefore, there was no violation of section 2. here, you have a situation where the district court found that the citizen voting age population in the south and west part of the state was 58 percent, and that under the state's plan, hispanics enjoyed 85 percent majority minority districts in that area, which is to say, six of the seven districts under the state's plans were districts in which hispanics enjoyed a majority of citizen voting age population. the decision within that area of where to draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and this court's precedents leaves up to the states. and, in fact, in the de grandy case, this court in  in particular considered the situation where a district line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up that neighborhood. the court discussed it on page 1015 of its decision. and it said that the fact that the district line went through that neighborhood and had an effect on minority voters, in terms of which district they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. and we think the same principle would apply here, where the fact that the district lines separating district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the state near laredo splits a hispanic neighborhood, which is, after all, not  not surprising given that the large percentage of the population in that part of the state is hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. the plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part of the state really sounds very much in a section 5 retrogression or dismantling claim, and this court made clear in the holder v. hall case that retrogression principles of section 5 are not applicable in section 2 cases. and we certainly think that that principle holds here and that 
and that's what we generally mean nowadays by the right  by  by the right to counsel. and when you talk about fairness being its objective, you're talking about the objective of that newly discovered right to have counsel appointed. but i don't know that fairness was the  was the object of the original right to counsel in the  in the bill of rights, which  which only applied to  to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one. i hardly think that  that fairness is the object of that.
well, if mr. wallace had been arrested and released, he would have had two years from when he was released to bring a civil rights action, that being false imprisonment
you're saying the changes occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore, what's left  what's let back into the river below the dam is the same river, unchanged.
but i think you can look to the way this court described recklessness in farmer vs. brennan as well, though, as well as 
he  he is to apply the formula, your honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it. for example, you have to separate flood flows from base flows. when you look at the  at the results of a  of a gauge on a river, you can see how much water was in the river at particular times, but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact.
well, not the burden that we talk about in the price context. but in the earlier cases they referred, cases like minnesota versus barber and some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant was there are certain kinds of regulations, and i think it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local needs requirements, local processing requirements, things likes that, which basically so obstruct interstate commerce as to require the virtual per se rule. indeed, pike itself has that very statement. that's sort of the classic case in which you invoke that high level of scrutiny. if the court has no further questions, i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
well, it includes a finding of probable cause. it includes a  seek an arrest or make an arrest or seek a warrant arrest when the arrest is impractical. if the arrest is impractical, such as when 
you could say the same thing about a petit jury. and in neder we use the harmless error standard.
well, the reasoning of smith is not based on the language of 2680. the reasoning of smith is based on the statement of legislative purpose, the background under which 2679(b) was enacted, and based on 2679(b)(2), which has  stating exceptions, and 2679(d)(4), which has procedures for the united states to certify and step into the shoes of the united states. so 
yes. i'm sorry. i misunderstood, if that was the question. we think it definitely should be eliminated, and the  and the court should say that it is applying the rational basis test. and i think it's instructive in the  in the post-agins era to look at the keystone decision, both the dissent and the majority in that case. it was  the court was essentially unanimous that the  that the taking provision of a clause does not authorize an inquiry into the efficacy of legislation. and in fact, on that point, the dissent quoted this court's decision in midkiff.
my  my concern simply is that you've made a conclusory statement that elsewhere there's a definition that doesn't 
i don't think so, your honor. i think it simply sets the outer limits within which our process of choice and other methods of assignment works. without that boundary, it could be transgressed one student at a time. the guidelines i think are very much like the little boy in the dutch story who put his finger in the dike because a few drops of water were coming out. he knew it would become a flood eventually if he didn't do that. we think that is exactly the case here, that without these guidelines one student at a time could transgress them and ultimately we would have a resegregated school system.
yes.
and here's why it matters, if i might, is that what petitioners and perhaps the government would say is that you're right. you don't find out about the fraud until the whole market finds out. but before you find out about the fraud, there can be terrific drops in the stock, which we think we could prove are related to the fraud. okay? because we've had certainly a market loss to what we paid. the stock has dropped down. we don't know about fraud yet. all of a sudden, there's a disclosure of fraud, and we all learn about it.
but you haven't made the claim.
yes, your honor. and i believe the court's opinion, in carden, identified "real party to the controversy" doctrine in a recent example. i believe it was mentioned again in the grupo dataflux opinion. the concept is that the real parties to the controversy must be before the court. and to respond to justice scalia's 
and because they came to the convention as sovereigns. let me say that 
go ahead.
 you're using the word "deliver," but the statutory word is "transmit." and  are there other statutes or regulations in respect to the post office that talk about "delivery"?
but if you are right and then it went back and the epa then said, well, an obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, we have the authority to say what comes first, congress  we couldn't possibly do everything that congress has authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though we have the authority to do this, we think that we should spend our resources on other things. suppose they said that? you said they didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then epa says our resources are constrained and we're not going to spend the money?
i was going to say i 
no, it was not.
well, it also might be a  a basis in terms of how to structure the injunction. we simply meant to indicate in footnote 27 the district court has discretion on remand to take these factors into account based on where the case is at that time. we're not taking a position one way or another what the court should do in this particular case. that is an exercise of discretion. it's subject to review for abuse of discretion. but i would like to talk about the four individual factors in this case because i think it provides helpful guidance in the resolution of the dispute before the court. as an initial matter, with regard to irreparable injury, patent infringement normally will result in irreparable injury because it denies the patent holder its statutory right to exclude others from practicing the invention. it's the type of right that is susceptible to irreparable injury because 
if you sell butter 
so, we can't draw 
but that's, in  in effect, saying that there is no  that the properly filed, given the pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed.
well, i think if you draw a distinction between intraipo allegations and interipo allegations, you go a long way towards doing it. and i should note, that's basically the line this court drew in nasd. if you look particularly at the part of the decision that deals with count 1 of the government's complaint, that was a horizontal allegation. and it was all in the context of vertical agreements that were specific to a particular mutual fund. and in that context, this court said that with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's nothing in the sec regulations that specifically addresses that, but the sec specifically blesses the vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional immunity to that horizontal agreement. that same page, page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have before us is an allegation by the government that there is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual funds. there is no allegation that they were trying to cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down competition between fidelity and wellington, for example. it was all in the context of individual funds and retarding the secondary market for individual funds. the language the court used on page 733 of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test. the court said, quote: "the close relationship is fatal" the close relationship between what the sec had prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought to be gone after in the context of the horizontal restraints, those are too closely related. i don't think that test has caused the undue confusion. and i think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of blanket immunity that would basically completely oust the antitrust laws. and i think that's the balance we hope to 
but the point, mr. chief justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter jurisdiction. it's not waivable and we're permitted to say that a district court decision based on subject-matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims. it is true that the perception at the time was that these holder theories evaded slusa. all of the courts up until that time of kircher ii had held that, and that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to take. now, certainly after dabit, those claims are foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims. we do  we obviously don't take issue with that. but here, the claims in the complaint themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly fair 
even if it reveals that the only basis for identifying this person as the defendant is the fact that the person has a massachusetts license plate and a compact car?
would you describe the model penal code as closer to restatement or aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence of general law?
yes, your honor, we're looking at the statute 
yes.
they certainly don't, justice souter, but new hampshire is a state that has actually  your own state is a state that has on its web site a set of out-of-state wineries. it requires that they keep and supply sales records on a monthly basis, that they keep those records for three years 
that is our position, your honor. i think there has been some question raised by the respondent, in his brief, trying to challenge both her authority over the actual bedroom, itself, which is an issue that wasn't raised below.
the  the  in the sue and be sued cases, this court construes that very broadly, and this is the same root word and 
but that's because the issues confined him to that.
that's absolutely our position, 13 justice souter.
well, so could the president's order, the same thing.
well, two responses. first of all, that's not true with respect to adjustment of status, because someone who reentered before iirira, at least if they reentered before 1984, couldn't have imagined that their marriage to a united states citizen would have given them a basis for adjustment, because adjustment simply was categorically unavailable to illegal entrants.
if it had said that 
but they can always amend the complaint and pare it down and say now  we  we complained all along about negligence. now, judge, we are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants' part, nothing more. no manipulation. cut out  they could have such a complaint, and would that be precluded if  if they started afresh in the state court and they said, we are complaining about mismanagement? we're not charging anyone with fraud or deception. couldn't  isn't that a viable claim?
i think that the problem is 
it's reasonable to assume that if there are actions against united states under the federal tort claims act, or actions finding government conduct unauthorized under the apa, that the government will take action to prevent that. here every action that was challenged was found to be appropriate and lawful under the existing regime. we would urge the court to reverse.
that is correct, justice stevens.
and, in fact, that's what the federal district court had done, your honor.
and a good thing, i agree. i would  i would hate to be doing this. but made up of wardens and deputy wardens, said mr. roe, there's no reason you should be here, you should get out. and then based on reasons and evidence, which mr. roe never knew, which the committee never knew  the committee thought mr. roe was in there for one reason, and it turned out on trial he was in there for another reason. the classification chief says to him  says, you're going to stay here another year. mr. roe goes back, has a perfect record, does every program he can do. he comes back to the committee. the committee says, mr. roe, you should get out of here again. and the classification chief again says, i'm sorry, for no reason i'm just going to keep you here. and at that point you say, well, mr. roe, you may be here for the rest of your life, and there's no  this is not definite like in the control unit where 
well, what  what sense would it make on the merits to get your interpretation on the merits, which would mean, i guess, that five individuals could be an enterprise because that's a group of individuals.
well, he's  i mean, i  i'm not saying that he isn't somebody who is protected by the laws of war, the customary laws of war. i think that he is protected by those. i don't think he's protected by the geneva conventions, but that's largely because he chose not to comply with the basic laws of war. he's obviously 
i say he's covered by the 
aggravating fact, uh  yes.
well again the whole way this was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that they, they acknowledged they had no specifics. they simply asked that an inference be drawn from the parallel conduct they alleged. and that is our central point that you simply cannot infer an agreement from this conduct. if the court has no questions, i reserve my time.
but that did not involve a monopoly. that did not involve monopoly power.
yes, your honor. i'm saying you should look as you have  and i see my time is up. if i may continue  you should look as you have, in all of the dormant commerce clause cases at the context that is presented. so if there is 100 
and that's going back to justice kennedy's question. i would look  i guess if we're supposed to get the better rule, the first place i'd look is what did the model penal code think. they think you should have the burden. then i think has this turned into a practical problem in the 29 states that have had it for 20 to 40 years. and you say we don't have any evidence to that effect. now, i've listed about four things here that i'd like your response to.
that would have been a good time for them to say we want a federal  federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that.
thank you, mr. chief justice. in answer to justice breyer's question, mr. kneedler said that a federal misdemeanor is a drug-trafficking crime under section 924(c) if a state punishes it as a felony. he said, "well, the federal government never prosecutes federal misdemeanors under section official 924(c)." he said, "the reason is because of 924(c)(1)(a)," and the language there is, it has to be an offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states. but that language  a person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states for a misdemeanor. so, the government is making an argument that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any court, has not ever been advanced by the government in a criminal context, and that would significantly expand section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that we cite in our brief that used the same definition of "drug-trafficking crime." the  mr. kneedler also said that the aggravated felony provisions in section 101(a)(43) refer to state law, but i read them just the opposite. there are two kinds. there are 21 of them. many of them say, "an offense described in 18 u.s. code section x." i mean, that's really what  we're dealing with one of those here. so, it clearly goes to federal law to define the offense. now, if state law or foreign law also punishes that offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but, clearly, federal law is defining the offense. there are other categories, such as murder and theft, that are defined, in general terms; but the government's position, as i understand it, is, again, you official use a generic uniform definition. you don't pick any definition that the states may have. the court just granted 
your honor, that's a different case. the beginning time period is a beginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.
correct. justice blackmun's dissent.
 in sufficient detail.
i think that by  by having a rule of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise cognizable section 1983 claims.
i think independent of whether there had every been a public disclosure, it would have been open to rockwell to argue in response to the original complaint that stone couldn't consistent with rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the plant after he left because he no longer had an evidentiary basis for doing so. rockwell could have made that argument, again regardless of whether a public disclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is a permissible inference for a plaintiff to say, i saw them committing systematic environmental violations while i was there and i inferred that the same thing would go on after i left  the question that's a permissible inference for a plaintiff in a federal civil action to make is a question to be decided under the federal rules of civil procedure. the public disclosure provision serves a different purpose entirely. it's designed for those cases in which the relator has sufficient information to file a complaint that complies with the federal rules of similar procedure, but that information overlaps substantially with information in the public domain.
what do you say about my vitamin a example?
justice breyer  and justice stevens, i do want to get back because i do have a lower court case that interprets any court in the way you discussed. i want to get back to that. but justice breyer, i understand this being a very important concern, and  and there are no doubt particular applications that could seem unappealing, just as in lewis v. united states where this court held that an invalid, a patently unconstitutional state conviction counts for section 922(g)(1). the reason that the  the convictions are covered here is congress was not 
in fact, anyone who's very familiar with the michigan guideline system would recognize that mr. halbert, if anything, received a break in the scoring of the guidelines. that  that ultimately the offense variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it was properly scored.
yes, your honor.
i mean, you  you begin by talking about the first amendment but you, you proceed as if there are no first amendment rights of, of workers involved at all.
i thought that the  the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage. some states have mandatory coverage for this or that. the case that was mentioned is the chiropractor. and the  in the federal scheme, the federal administrator didn't want to be saddled with whatever the particular packages that the states had. so the coverage and the benefits  those were to be determined on the federal level, and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever the state thought would be good to have in the plan.
no. there 
hmm.
but your  your parade of horribles just never 
suppose we think  suppose we disagree with you on the latter point. we think he is really in a bind; there's not really anything he can do. doesn't that invoke the davis versus passman rationale?
but again, mr. chief justice, thrifts, s&ls, state-chartered banks in all 50 states are permitted to have operating subsidiaries. it's recognized not just for national banks, but really for all types of banking institutions, that are operating subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. this is not a sort of special privilege that's given 
that  that same argument could have made in  in arguing about racial segregation in the schools and  and in the military and everything else. that's  that's not an acceptable answer.
i didn't understand that you made this 
misleading. because when i just read this rule cold, that's what i assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the tax court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.
and if you're right that that's wrong, i don't see how you could possibly get out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision before final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. because if you're right, then this is before final judgment, it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. that's the end of your case.
my comment on the dna evidence is that the dna evidence did nothing more than confirm what the jury was  already knew was very likely, which was that the donor of the semen was the husband. the jury at trial was informed that the husband  and it went through several pages. in the joint appendix, it goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're exploring that the semen could have been deposited by the husband or by mr. house.
 presumably implicated him 
well, that's pretty good evidence, isn't it? i mean, he may be a believable witness on this point. i don't know.
your honor, the motive is  is well supported by the circumstances. and in fact, if you look at the prosecutor's argument 
well, you know, you don't get a summary judgment case all the time. i used to get them, and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied. does that mean he didn't consider the arguments? that's a very common thing. here we have a district judge, he hears all the arguments. the attorneys brought it out. it's in the file. he reads the presentence report. it's all there, and the judge says, on balance, i'm going to go apply the guidelines. so how can you say he didn't consider them?
if the treaty does include hoasca, which we believe that it doesn't.
it's a for example thing.
i agree with that, your honor. that is  that's exactly what  that's exactly what judge sneed did. and when we were talking about this statute here, it talks about us proving those  that loss causation and tying it to the actual omissions. and it follows two sections that deal with pleading, material  deal with particularized pleading as to falsity and as to scienter. and this statute says that if you don't plead one or two with the particularity required, then the complaint shall be dismissed. this section here 
would  would you respond to the  to the argument that the alaska arctic coast case decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?
well, we  we do  we do have the rule if it  if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the jones act and osha, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag.
yes  well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense.
thank you, mr. hungar.
well, what  what she was in duress about is she was told at the time that there was somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone call away. so as far as she was concerned, there was somebody there with a gun to the head of her children and she was in fear of her children's life. in terms of what  what the government knew in this particular case, the government had notice. the trial judge required that we provide notice of a defense. the trial judge required that if we  said that if we had an expert, we had to give the government notice of the expert and the subject matter of the testimony of the expert. so the government was very well informed prior to trial what the defense was so that they hired their own expert who actually was able to interview the  the accused without me being there and  and so was prepared to testify about the issues of duress.
 underlying 
and i'll try to focus my own thoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're arguing, related, that when they passed the hobbs act, it had a section 2, and section 2 said that, "this is an act that forbids robbery and extortion, all involving interstate commerce. and robbery/extortion involve property." then it had a section 5. and section 5 said, "this act forbids physical violence or threats of violence related to section 2." now, all that happened since then is, there was a recodification. and the recodification wasn't meant to change anything substantive. second and related point: enmons. for 35 years, working people in this country have thought they had a right to strike, free of the hobbs act. and your interpretation, as the afl-cio points out, will gut the right to strike. now, those are two strong arguments against you, and i'd like to hear your response.
well, why haven't they done it? and i had thought also that they were supposed to control 527's by having regs or individual cases that would decide whether there was a mix of personnel between the campaign and the 527, whether they talked to people and planned their strategy. have there been those regs written?
that would mix apples and oranges, because "conspiracy" and "aiding and abetting" are two entirely different things. one is a standalone offense. and one is a theory of how to prove a violation 
i don't think so, justice souter, because  because the  it's a question i think of abstraction. what we normally do is hire employees and review their applications. now, in that process, we've been alleged to engage in illegal acts by providing them with false identifications. but i don't see how that's any different from the reves situation where the claim is that you're providing ordinary auditing advice, but in the process you're lying. you're engaged in illegal activities. it seems to me it is precisely the same problem in both situations.
so your difference  what's separating you and whitman, it seems, is a question of timing. the action that you're describing that would come at the end, after he's used the administrative process, is the same one that he is seeking to bring at the front end. that is, it's a 1331 action 
can you tell me as of the time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he committed any felonies?
yes. the court of appeals in the bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the identical language of the issue raised here, that this was not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself bound as law of the case because the merits had not been resolved. i think the bulger case is kind of the paramount case because it is the michigan supreme court conferring the proper legal understanding of the applications for leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is discretionary. i think that fits with common sense understanding because there is no right to have the merits reviewed. otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected. otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals. the court of appeals has full authority to make the determination that even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to correct the error.
i don't mean that.
that's this case.
do you know what the 
what i believe is that this was sent out by mail. so they had, you know, the three-day mail rule, and that's how you came to the 14 days in connection with the  put in the 17-day limit on 
 in any situation 
it would apply simply as a matter of  of contract construction in determining what the contract was that  that would be looked to for determining what equitable remedy would be available.
 generally. i don't need a bright line rule. i'm just trying to find out what it is about this that violates the clause if it isn't the first thing or the second thing that i mentioned.
yes, but what does it mean? i mean, i've given you a suggestion as to what it seems to mean on a straightforward reading, and  and i take it you disagree with that. but can you explain how it could mean something else?
no. but what happens to the time? how do you count that time if you lose here?
you said the court of appeals to apply it. could the court of appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula.
i'll respond to anything, your honor.
we don't  that is exactly the harlow standard. that is exactly the standard that was applied in crawford-el against britton as the first step in the stage of developments in that case.
what if we thought that the activities of the multiple underwriters were comparable to a single joint venture? in many respects they're like a joint venture. would that mean your whole case could collapse? in other words, i'm really wondering to what extent you're depending on your horizontal agreement as opposed to the vertical arrangements like laddering and flipping and that sort of thing.
well, no. the restatement, for example, at the time of rogers talked about substantial factors, and talked, in other words 
 don't need this act to sue them.
i  i don't want to take up too 
can you recover? is it like the ucc where you've got to mitigate your damages? you cannot recover those damages even though you've suffered them. you have a stock certificate that's worth half of what it's worth even in an efficient market. and when the truth comes out, that's true, you'll be damaged, and if you sell it before then, you get no recovery.
if  if two of the reasons that the ninth circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without  to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?
what about evading a cuban tax law that we think  that many people would think is an unjust tax law? i mean, one of the things i'm worried about is that this gets us into foreign policy. are you sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter what those tax laws happen to be?
did the prosecutor  did the prosecutor object when there was a further extension given for the pendency of the petition for rehearing?
so he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable. i don't think we should approach the discussion as though that's, that's the situation.
no, "delayed" wouldn't be within either term. "lost," i think, means exactly what it says, mail that's lost. "lost" means lost.
uh, yes.
 that michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?
i believe it has.
yes.
yes.
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i want to state that we do not believe that we waived our position on the interest calculation as was just suggested in the  in the last colloquy. the reason that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest. and it turned out that the court chose the  the test that we now have, which is a relatively easy test to apply. it has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense. and we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. if look at our brief from that exception, the one in  in support of our exceptions, in particular  particularly to page 25, footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the  the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950 through 1968 period.
 by boats. but to assure your honor, there  for example, there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the picture.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: we are here about a bankruptcy priority, and bankruptcy priorities must be clearly granted by statute or they are not granted at all. that's the first principle of bankruptcy law that this court has laid down, that equal priority, that equal distribution is the first principle, and every priority is a deviation from that first principle, and therefore, they must be clearly set out in the statute. this court has been very clear over and over on those bedrock principles. applying them here, zurich must demonstrate that its workers' comp insurance policy receivables are clearly included within the statutory phrase of 507(a)(4), contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered within 180 days. judge niemeyer  judge niemeyer followed those principles, those bedrock principles of this court. the two concurring opinions below did not follow nor even mention those principles, and that led them to err, we  we submit.
 1983 
well, why doesn't the 1981  given  maybe i don't  haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? i think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial.
well, the eighth amendment, as this court said in tuilaepa, does apply to the selection factors. it looks as  at whether there's a commonsense core meaning.
 in essence, he did, when we 
but, yes, that's exactly what 
does that  does that raise a first-amendment problem?
but they're not asking for that. am  am i wrong on 
no, i'm not sure i understood that answer. so, in this situation, if the employer said that mr. ceballos was performing his job poorly, that would be enough to tip the balance in the employer's favor 
but they didn't reopen the issue. they said there's nothing new here. we don't need to reopen this decision, and 
no, but we know it 
why can't the government 
if they had specific information along those lines, that  that there was evidence hidden in places or  or stored in places where it could easily be disposed 
 that was talking the big power lunch.
yes, okay. but to return  to return to the revenue rule  and thank you, justice stevens, for bringing me back to that  the government has acknowledged that there can be no restitution here. and that's in  that's in the joint appendix, at page 106. they expressly waived it. they said that even if there was a foreign judgment that canada was trying to bring here, that would be unenforceable. there could be no rico actions, because that's unenforceable; and no proxy suits on behalf of a foreign government. and so the only thing that they say is, beyond  is not included  the only act of enforcement which they say is not included is, somehow, criminal enforcement. and under section 14 of the  excuse me, under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution, congress has power to enforce that amendment, and it has done so both in enacting statutes for civil recovery, as well as criminal recovery  criminal punishment, excuse me. and so it's  the notion that somehow incarcerating someone is not  is not punishment is not something that makes much sense in that context. the decisions of this court have held that penalties are  monetary penalties count as punishment, and also that injunctions are  fall within the scope of the revenue rule. that's in the wisconsin versus pelican insurance case, which actually addresses the penal  the penal rule, which is the close corollary.
it would not be a departure, your honor. in fact, that's common practice in the fourth amendment area. this court, for example, in new york v. harris looked to the purposes of the rule against arrest in the home absent a warrant and to conclude that it wasn't appropriate to suppress a statement made at the station even though it assumed that there was but-for causation. and this court in cruz did a similar analysis. it's very common to look to the purposes served 
and  and the  the statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material, which is what is going on here, into the navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites. i'm sorry. the  the permits that  that are required here 
i've looked at them and  i would agree with mr. phillips that the analysis doesn't tend to be lengthy, but i think feldman would be one. by and large, the  the courts adopt the  the reasoning that we've adopted here, namely that because the word includes signals an intent to be nonexhaustive or to admit of other things being covered even if they're not on the list, then they should be covered. the 
mr. chief justice, good morning, and may it please the court: in merrell dow pharmaceuticals, the court recognized an important limitation on the court's prior substantial federal question cases. the sixth circuit should have followed merrell dow rather than ignoring it in deciding whether the presence of a federal issue in this michigan quiet title action properly gave rise to federal question jurisdiction. according to merrell dow, any state law claim that alleges a violation of a federal statute as an element of the state law cause of action does not state a claim arising under federal law for section 1331 purposes unless 
can i ask you about the bivens theory here before your time runs out? doesn't davis versus passman help the respondent here?
sure. right. and there's nothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has found religion and wants to come clean for arguing: let me convert, it's in the interest of everybody if i do convert. this is a discretionary right to deny relief. the court is free to allow conversion. but under the plain terms of section 1370(c), the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert a case to chapter 7 without waiting for a plan to be filed. there's no requirement that the court has to sit there for 15 days and see if there's a plan. a chapter 7  excuse me 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i think that we have lost sight of the statutory scheme that applies here. section 1182(d)(5)(a) is not a detention statute. it's clearly not preserved as an initial matter. it was not in the answer to either habeas petition. the justification given in the district court in both cases was 1231(a)(6). but, justice breyer, there is no need to remand this case because a clear, simple reading of the immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a detention statute. you have to go through the process, and i attempted to do this in my reply brief, but i think i can do it a little bit more clearly for the court this morning. when an alien first arrives, he's an applicant for admission. section 1225(b)(2)(a) of title 8, united states code says an applicant for admission  any applicant for admission shall be detained until the removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt, that they are entitled to come in. so all aliens, when they apply  that's the detention statute that initially applies, 1225(b)(2)(a). they are to be detained until there is a removal proceeding. the removal proceeding, which is governed by 1229(a)(1)  i'm sorry  1226(a)  it is 1229(a)  is to determine whether the alien is admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether they must be removed. so 1225(b)(2)(a) says detain until that point. 1182(d)(5)(a) then comes in to authorize the government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons and parole an alien in. we won't have the removal process. we're going to  we  we're going to get out of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(a), and we're going to let you out on parole, which is discretionary. that's 1182(d)(5)(a). if at any time, we in our discretion think it is no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(a) says once parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any other applicant for admission. so you go back to 1225(b)(2)(a), which says detain them until the removal proceeding.
 because, otherwise, it would official be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to come in or out, right?
this person being in the room and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a room, as a result of your being in that room, you're likely to find evidence. so it's both but for and it fits within the problem. there we are. that's the same, by the way, as it is with making a false oath to a magistrate. you make a false oath to a magistrate. that permits the magistrate to get into the house with  the policeman gets in there with a warrant. it doesn't take the court long to suppress that. about a second. and  and how  how is this somehow different?
you're arguing that by filing the claim, the state has waived all of its immunity, but i don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver upon states. i see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's different than saying that there's a waiver. is your argument that just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out they didn't  may or may not have that authority, they necessarily imposed a waiver?
yes, but as your honor is aware, that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this court referred to in nelson, i believe, as a substantially lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by habeas. moreover, it's telling 
 tilt in favor.
 revocation. and some are in compliance with state law, but the fifth factor is, "such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety." it seems to me that's a clear grant of authority to go beyond state law.
well, i guess you would be content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the plea colloquy in court.
well, that's my point too. (laughter.)
all right.
well, but they have to be an aggravating factor.
there is, justice stevens, but those are lower court decisions.
no, i mean in this proceeding.
your honor, my response is that is absolutely wrong. the first draft of the plan which you can see on page 28 of the appendix says explicitly, and i quote, "all workers compensation programs are treated as executory contract." treated as executory contracts and deemed assumed by the debtor, and that means that the workers got the most favorable treatment that they could have gotten. these are not just unsecured claims.
well, i think the first part of your premise is clearly correct and totally consistent with the position we are taking. whether it happened here or not is an interesting question. it is in the nature of a limiting instruction, which was basically what this was. you can use the evidence for one purpose, legitimate purpose, but don't use it for an illegitimate purpose. but we can't tell ordinarily, because jury deliberations are secret and we can't probe what they have decided, we can't probe whether they have imposed global punishment or not. but we anticipate the problem. we proposed an instruction which would as best we could at the time official address the problem. maybe it could be edited up to be a little sharper. but i think it contains the essential point that we're driving at here today.
all right. well 
i do endorse it. the only question i have  i mean, i don't think that it necessarily has to be  that every word has to be identical in the two provisions, but i do think they have to be congruent. and so, that's the strong version official of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the fourth circuit was. the weaker version of our argument, which gets i think some mileage on the arbitrary and capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in two statutes, and epa then purports to be implementing that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term modification. and the reason 
i think that this  i do think that is what the opinion says and stands for. and i think this court recognized 
yes.
but i don't understand, linguistically, why this isn't "putting something into the water," to the extent the dam holds back and restrains the water, then it "puts back into the water" the water that it had held back.
oh, i'm sure there are some states that don't. i think there are about 30-some states that do, as i recall.
isn't it true that there's no traffic on the road at that particular time?
it seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. i mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. but the fact that for a  an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are  you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.
isn't it odd that this  the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the fair labor standards act people who were not covered before. so it added household workers. and yet you say that, while congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the act.
with respect to the text of the statute and whether the anti-lien provision applies, i'd be interested in your view, as a matter of arkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first and, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement recovery after the assignment had taken place.
but, during that period, did the defense lawyer have the right to rely on the acquittal in deciding whether or not to put in defensive evidence on the count from which he thought his client had been acquitted?
mr. chief justice and may it please the court: congress enacted the prison litigation reform act to deal with the flood of prisoner litigation that was coming into the federal courts, obscuring the treatment for meritorious claims brought by all litigants. the purpose of the act was to unburden the courts from dealing with this flood of litigation that largely was without merit. the purposes for the act were to increase the quality of the litigation, decrease the quantity of the litigation, allow the states to address first the issues that the prisoners have problems with and to develop an administrative record to facilitate judicial screening. and all of this would result in increased judicial resources for all litigation that has potential merit. the invigorated exhaustion requirement does require total exhaustion. the statute, the words of the statute itself confirm this. the statute states: "no action shall be brought until" 
well, i 
of course.
right. but 
say that again.
at the trial or the appellate level, either one 
anywhere. i  i just think 
but  but the other  the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. it's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your  your headquarters operating budget for ihs. so they say, if i understand them, that the  that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.
your honor 
because there 
i do, your honor. and my  my 2 reason for that is when you look to the argument itself, 3 those words were used in a very controlled situation. 4 they  they did not by their tone or the overall tenor of 5 the argument or their content tell the jury to take the  6 the defendant's future dangerousness into account.
knowledge of prior unlawful acts is relevant evidence in deciding whether it's present day intentional discrimination. but just as in a case where there's a promotion and i'm aware that there was a prior discrimination in a promotion and that was not timely challenged, and the person comes to me today and says i want my promotion now. if i'm aware that she was denied that promotion for discriminatory reason but she did not timely challenge it, my decision not to give her that promotion is not automatically discriminatory.
mr. baker, as i understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case, your client filed for relief under chapter 13 and that relief was denied. you're now seeking under  official your petition seeks a conversion to chapter 13 and i guess i wonder what relief is still open to you.
well, i mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context. but we also keep repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context. and here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful" means.
it 
because the text of the  of the probable cause requirement in the fourth amendment has clearly been announced by this court to always require the magistrate's determination of the facts, as well as the legal grounds, after studied caution to make that determination.
no, but my, i guess, let me just get to the point and you can answer that.
we believe two propositions. number one, you can't exceed the seventh amendment, and the seventh circuit 
i think it clearly would, justice ginsburg. and the facts in this 
well, we're proposing our first argument, because we think it's textually correct and historically correct. it leads to the same result, in our case, a point i was about to make. our second argument is that, even if you construe this statute as a fee-shifting statute, the standard under the fee-shifting statute should be the one that your honor just mentioned, which is, it's a multifactor test, but the primary factor is whether the ground for removal is objectively reasonable. and under that standard, we win.
so perhaps i could be forgiven for not understanding 
well, unless you house them with the cellmate, what are you going to learn from segregating them for 14 days?
i  i can't recall.
why doesn't that get you right back to the point that justice breyer was making? you are saying, i think, in essence if you send a blueprint  this is like a blueprint. it tells, it tells a machine which may be in europe how to put the object code on other disks or on hard drives. the machine in europe is following instructions just the way an artisan would follow a blueprint.
which would mean it would be ambiguous, wouldn't it?
no, i'm saying 
suppose that you said explicitly, the prosecutor  which he didn't say  but you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around, and he's one of them. and this sentencing phase isn't about just  just isn't about william weaver. it is about sending a message to the others. and if you execute him, even if you think he shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should be, but, you see, others will think that this is a message. so do it just to give a message. even if you think he never did it. no matter what you think of him, you think he's the best person in the world. still execute him just to send a message. now would that violate the constitution?
i don't see that. where?
because if this, if this continues, your argument  and i understand your argument that there's no essential free-standing cause of action for damages  basically means he has a right to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each individual incursion, each individual wrong. well, again that assumes that he wouldn't get any relief out of the ibla. that assumes that if he had gone to the ibla and said, you canceled my grazing permits for grounds that weren't valid, that the blm would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct. in fact, the ibla 
getting back to the practical equivalent of a guilty plea, brookhart v. janis do you think goes to the outer margin of what the functional equivalent is? are there other examples of what a functional equivalent would be that would fall under both cronic and brookhart? we have a line-drawing problem 
doesn't it strike you as  as strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at 6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be  won't  that there isn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30 when it will be served. you say that's perfectly okay. but if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until 6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.
i'm leaving out everything that this court excluded in swancc, and i wouldn't have thought that the  that the court necessarily suggested there was going to be some subset that had a further insignificant nexus because it wasn't  the argument of the government in those cases was obviously  we didn't just concede that those bodies of water were utterly isolated. we said they did have important ecological connections with the water. and i think the way i read swancc is that we can't make that 
"miscarriage" would be mail that went to the wrong location. if it was misdelivered, that's what "miscarriage" would mean in this context.
well, i don't think we would say, in that example, that you are offering windshields, per se. i mean, to give an example, carmax.com offers cars for sale over the internet, but i don't think we would ordinarily say that they are offering windshields or steering wheels or tires for sale. certainly, that's not been necessary construction of a regulatory regime that, say, is designed to focus on sellers of tires. it wouldn't automatically, as a matter of law, have to be applied to entities that are selling cars instead. and the same is true here.
 unenforceable. if the  if the point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that  that may be a different case, although i think there would still be an estoppel argument, that they should not be permitted to bring that action without giving up the benefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit. i mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this case.
but there's  used on the other side and as a policy model, the model penal code, i think, says it's okay. it  not really that it's okay. it should be considered.
your honor, if i 
by  by known, i mean to the declarant.
no, your honor. the  they may be, in other senses, and in  and in seeking other customers, in a  in some sense, in competition with other volvo dealers. but, at the point that the price discrimination occurs, they are not. and, therefore, even in the  in the  in the  well, in any of the examples offered by the respondents in this case, they don't show price discrimination between competing purchasers, which is what this court, in the morton salt case and in other cases, have indicated the act was aimed at. and as mr. englert indicated, that is why, in the 70 years since the robinson-patman act was enacted, we haven't seen cases like this, because it is understood that the act has no application in these circumstances, and 
and you say all that stuff is not for congress; that's for us.
it would be the same argument. and i would add that epa in other contexts has determined on several occasions that a 1 percent contribution is significant under the clean air act.
and both as a matter of double jeopardy and as a matter of washington law, i don't think that  that would  could occur. the washington supreme court correctly held that harmless error analysis could not apply where the trial court has set aside the jury's complete verdict on a lesser offense in favor of a judgment on the greater, both as a matter of state and federal law. and mr. recuenco would ask this court to affirm that decision.
yes. i  i thought you were getting to the point of saying that on the objective test that you urge, the officer  the objective police officer who sets the standard is deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the scene actually knows. in other words, we don't exclude information 
but that's a viewpoint-neutral regulation. this isn't, the principal didn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did she?
i'm  i'm not sure that i  that i'm satisfied with the answer. you're  you're trying to give us one rule for constitutional claims and another rule for statutory claims?
yes.
 who  whose purchase is excluded, can nonetheless sue 
well, do you agree that that's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?
would it have been better 
and i don't think congress intended to eliminate a swath of class actions concerning a type of claim that this court had said could not be brought under 
the issue of a knock-and-announce violation leading to exclusion of evidence 
but that was for a resale to  that was for resale to different purchasers.
i don't know that i agree with that. i mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an hour is responsible for endangering people, you're proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop him, you shouldn't do anything. i don't agree with that.
well, you're 
how would it have been presented? because it wasn't  it wasn't even in the record in the district court. i mean, that was what suhrheinrich was so bewildered about, that here was what seemed to be the strongest evidence for the defendant, and at the end of the proceeding in the district court, it's not even made formally a part of the record. it was a deposition. right?
well, that's precisely why we've said, in fact, what  there are two independent sources of authority here, because, by operation of the supremacy clause, the icj, the interpretation and application of the avena judgement would be given effect. now we have an independent source of right in the form of the president's determination.
absolutely.
i think in  in context when told that only under these circumstances you're going to receive counsel in bringing discretionary application, that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go forward with the  his plea 
there isn't?
do you know of any case in which a california trial judge has gone beyond the middle range not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that the punishment should be greater, something along the lines of what justice breyer suggested?
how about "knowingly"? does that  does that usually connote knowledge of the illegality?
i'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?
 from harm, to make you give warnings 
why isn't  why isn't that very similar to this? i mean, what difference does it make whether there's a  there's a transaction here, isn't there? isn't there a transaction?
yes.
your honor, the court in wood v. united states took account of the possibilities of official artful pleading and would allow the government to challenge the characterization of the incident.
from the inception of the rules.
i think that's an appropriate manner in dealing with it. but if you  if you look at the michigan court of appeals opinion 
that's what the  the lower courts have found to be true. but justice  currently, justice ginsburg, they found it to be true that the exigent circumstances we're not met under these facts. it wasn't serious enough to enter the home without the warrant, and i think that's the pivot point. where is that line on the exigent circumstances? and our position would be that that line  that it's got to be serious, it's got to be imminent, it's got to be an ongoing situation, something where somebody is either going to get seriously injured, evidence is going to be destroyed, somebody is going to flee.
no. but i don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule. the rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and i don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.
 i don't think that would be a claim for contribution to the plan, your honor, in the same sense that we're talking about here. the  if i  if i could 
okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?
i don't think that's right, your honor. we cited to the court the pannell case, the associated general contractors case, and roe versus wade, all of which look at post-filing factors to 
yes, your honor.
it is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is 
counsel, what if you have a case where a company says we are not going to deal with any companies that have an african american as the ceo? couldn't that ceo, the individual, claim that that policy interferes with his ability to make contracts with his company to be the ceo?
that's not my brief, your honor, i apologize. in any event, it limits the hearing officer's ability to reward relief based on the substantive, whether the substantive right to the fape has been awarded or not. and then we return to justice breyer's point about the party aggrieved, the party aggrieved by the finding or decision. because the decision is limited to substantive grounds, that is what we are really talking about here. and i think one of the confusing aspects about what the nature of the substantive right is, and i think we've heard some different versions of that this morning, is what is the scope. petitioners in their reply brief seem to try to retreat a little bit and make the rights more palatable. but if they  in doing so, the question is, what is the right different than the child's right? and we simply do not have the answer to that, and for the school districts applying this act on a daily basis, and for courts interpreting it, it simply poses numerous problems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was designed to benefit children.
in this case?
he says that occurred before enron had even gotten a letter.
that create a property right?
i think, your honor, that again, removing that language from smith, from the language in  if you're talking about johnson, i know you're referring to johnson, that the language in johnson about some effect can't be separated from the language about meaningful effect.
 mean, the prison-remedy thing is  the only thing it does is make it take a longer time to get to court, but it does the prison no good. it's going to be liable for damages anyway.
there was a settlement agreement, justice ginsburg. but the department of interior stands behind the actions that are issued, at issue in this case, and i think 
there has been some criticism of the rule, justice ginsburg, but it is applied in criminal cases in federal courts; and whatever criticism there might be in the academic literature, even in some state decisions, we think it is just inconceivable that congress would have intended that somebody could be convicted under this theory under the federal criminal law and be subject to the same criminal penalties as a principal, and yet under the federal immigration law could not be subject to the same immigration consequences as a principal. so whatever grounds there are for criticizing it, it is the law in most places. and most importantly, we think, it is the law in federal courts. taking account of minor variations in formulation of aiding and abetting standards among jurisdictions would not only have the consequence of drastically limiting the number of aliens who could be found to be aggravated felons, because of the difficulty of establishing that someone was convicted as a principal rather than an aider and abettor. it would also complicate removal cases enormously, as i mentioned. the premise of respondent's aiding and abetting theory would suggest that in any case, it would be necessary for the immigration judge, board of immigration appeals and the reviewing court, to engage not only in an analysis of whether the principal offense of conviction matches some federal definition, which itself can be a quite complex enterprise, but having done that, it would then have to go on and compare the aiding and abetting law of the state of conviction with some federal aiding and abetting law.
if we're talking about the kinds of crimes that are involved with this kind of, with street crime, with murder, armed robbery, rape, the defendant is not allowed to let them run over two years.
and you contend that they do  the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are unconstitutional.
it is.
it seems like 100 years ago. (laughter.)
i don't think it was more than a year or two.
your honor, you have to  you have to  if it's michigan-plated, that's the triggering mechanism. it's not the  that's  that's what triggers the $100 fee.
justice alito, in our view, "illicit trafficking" means any offense that has a trafficking element  that is, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, manufacture 
that is one of our principal contentions, justice breyer, which is 
he does that.
two responses mr. chief justice. first, in other regimes, where you have a fee-shifting statute, the cases are usually still brought by pro se litigants. here because you are dealing with a minor child, really, it is an all or nothing proposition. either bring the case and you have the potential to recover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought at all. and this is borne out by the statistics cited in our position and the amicus briefs from the council of parent attorneys and advocates, and the autism society of america.
yes, justice ginsburg. it would mean under  under a plain meaning reading of 2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on the merits, it would bar subsequent federal review whether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a procedural claim. however, in atkins v. kentucky there would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from going back to the state court and arguing cause and prejudice, and then if the state court were to make a procedural determination on the second petition that was  that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he could take that to the federal court. the federal court could then look at that because it was only a procedural determination by the state court on the second habeas claim and the federal court at that point could look back at the substantive rule as established law because on the second claim they have the right, if he's only denied a procedure  on a procedural basis, there's nothing that would preclude the federal court on his second claim from looking back at what would then be established law.
well 
i  i think that they are of equal weight in the minds of the legislators in the state of missouri. the  mr. simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking this court to 
and, in fact 
the component is the, is the actual machine readable copy of software that is inserted in 
yes. if they knew  i think then they would enter without knocking. if  if the 
this is the very first petition that mr. burton has filed against the 1998 judgment. he did file earlier a petition against the original judgment of 1994. in the joint appendix at page 34, that is where that petition is reprinted. he says quite clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that petition, whereas here this is his first petition against the 1998 judgment.
that's correct, your honor.
no. this is the current method that we intend to use in all future executions. period. we may change our mind.
and this doesn't? i mean, this which is somehow based on the notion that a school that is predominantly black or overwhelmingly black cannot be as good as a school that is predominantly white or overwhelmingly white? that doesn't send any message?
well, if the language absolutely unambiguously compels that reading, then i think it would be a difficult position. but i don't think it goes, goes to that degree.
that's correct.
but it  would it be a sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the judgment that after the project is completed, there will be a  a hydrological connection?
okay.
so your answer to my question is there's nothing else they could have done, but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't going to work either.
right.
because?
it was very 
i am. i would say that that's a  that's a conclusion 
yes.
the en banc 
and that only applies 
it goes on frequently in an opinion. i have been known to do that myself. and i say this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and i say "sure isn't that." well, what is it?
yes, your honor.
thank you, justice stevens, and may it please the court: claim 13 satisfies the written description, enablement and definiteness requirements of section 112 of the patent act. the patent specification sets forth the scope and nature of the claimed invention in terms readily understandable by a person of ordinary skill in the art and it enables such persons to practice the claimed invention.
i thought 
 be the same way.
 they've treated 
if a  including, you know, busting into his lodge and disrupting the furniture and all of that, they thought that that was probably 
and in that case would it mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago and she won, but she didn't bring her act until august of 2006, that she could only then collect the extra money for the preceding 2 years?
even though it's retained in a  what  an impoundment pool, or whatever, behind 
well, then now you're giving  now you're making their situation worse because they tried to make your client's situation better. i mean, yes, they could  maybe they could prohibit religious journals as well, but they  for various reasons, they decided not to do that. maybe they could have eliminated legal materials as well, but again, they decided not to do it. they take a more circumscribed approach. so i'm not sure it's a very effective response to say, well, they let religious materials in and that can be used as well.
uh-huh.
the insurance contract is not in the record. that's right, but the 
not of the search. of her detention.
 would allow for 
and then what  what's your position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's left, and he's running down the block?
we're not sure 
 we're not saying that, your honor.
okay.
i  no doubt, your  i  and i wasn't suggesting otherwise, justice scalia. i'm just suggesting that, here, we have  exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in lopez, the case might have come out different. there is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. none. the only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. there is no connection.
let's say a new case comes up tomorrow and the person is charged in an information with assault in the second degree, and it's clearly alleged in the information that a firearm was used. but then when the case is submitted to the jury, the judge just forgets to charge on the firearm factor or element. would that  could that be harmless error? is that any different from the case that's before us?
and you have not been  and  and michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?
but to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.
who  who develops the model penal code? is that the american law institute that does that?
i don't think that it is. for example, remember that in bazemore there were plaintiffs, workers who were hired after the merger, after 1965, and when they were hired they were paid the same rate as the white employees, and the disparity in their wages in 1972 arose solely because of the discriminatory application of a merit-based pay raise decision, system, which is exactly the same kind of claim that we're making in this case. but this court nonetheless held that continuing to pay workers, those workers, less than similarly situated whites because of that discrimination that occurred before the effective date of the act was still a present violation of title vii.
abrogated.
right.
the first thing is when  is official this a successive  is this a successive petition, and we would say it is, because he filed the first one and then the second one. now the question of whether he can get relief under the first  under his first habeas petition does not depend on the entry of a final judgment. in fact, under the facts of this case, the judgment was entered in march of 1998. in december of 1998, he filed his first petition. and in fact, the first petition was denied in april of 2000 on the merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and because they were ripe, because they  the factual predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that was all that was required for him to bring those claims. he didn't have to wait for a final judgment.
i'm not sure i follow, justice stevens.
i think statements that law enforcement officer merely overhear may not be testimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this court's bourjaily decision, which it cited with approval in crawford, is if somebody make  if somebody makes statements that tend out  that turn out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement is in a different scenario, mr. chief justice, than somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even  and i want to make sure i understand your hypothetical. if the person realized that a police officer was standing there and hearing what she was telling her neighbor, we may then have a testimonial situation. but in this case what we have is not simply a blurting out or a cry for help. in fact, ms. mccottry never asked for help. she said she didn't need an aid car. what we have are a series of 26 questions that the 911 operator asked ms. mccottry that established every element of the crime the court  i'm sorry  that the state ultimately proved.
i thought they said that their  their compensation law was congruent with ours?
but you have no argument that congress imposed a waiver.
and it would be in the district court.
 (3)   (b)(i) again. and, in this section, congress is telling the fda what are the considerations that the fda has to weigh in making the safety decision, the decision whether to allow clinical trials in humans 
at least that's not the way you answered justice breyer.
i don't believe michigan has a procedure for granting no-knock warrants, not 
do you think that's a strong 
no. i mean, if there were no expenditure limits, if candidates could expend as much as they want, could they raise enough money with these contribution limits 
well, how does one  how does one determine what is the better view?
it was raised in the district court and the government chose not to raise it in the court of appeals or here. but, of course, you have, as justice scalia said, an independent obligation to satisfy yourself of your subject matter jurisdiction.
plans 
so, if you had a policy that, "we're going to deny any employer that uses tanks," do you think that would pass muster under the solomon amendment?
that's true, your honor, but 
i agree with that. i'm asking you if they found there was no hydrological connection.
well, on  on seven or eight of the counts, it's knowingly. well, actually on the first count it's knowingly, but that is defined as  as  in this case, it was defined as voluntarily and intentionally. and then in the other counts, it was simply defined as knowingly. and so, indeed, that  that's  that is what the congress said. however, based on the  the precedents of this court, that even when there is a knowingly culpable mental state provided by congress, this court has impart  imported the  the criminal intent to  into the statute. and so like in  for instance, in morissette, which was a theft case, what this court did was the congress had said knowingly didn't provide a  a criminal intent. so this court imported one and said that the court  that the government had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. once the defense was raised, it became an element that the government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
well, we think so, your honor.
i would disagree your honor.
i think it was an alternative in this case, and the defense didn't proffer, at the time of the objection, anything that they thought that might be less. and i think the trouble comes in here  again, i don't believe a least restrictive alternatives approach is appropriate, but when you talk about least restrictive, i think it's sometimes difficult to tell what is less restrictive than something else because not all restraints 
your honor, if you're describing the federal system or just a hypothetical system, my understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge can impose whatever sentence he wants. and whether or not in a particular system, that will be reviewed for reasonableness is a separate question as to what he 
that's what i can't understand, why that is so important to the state.
 injunction.
your honor, there's nothing to prevent that.
mr. chief justice, i think that the drafting conventions between the two subsections is key. 706(a) says the debtor may convert. whereas other sections of the code, like 1307(b), other provisions, provide that upon request of the debtor, the court shall take some particular action. here the use of the "may"  i think the word "may" properly signals discretion in the court.
the only thing, but the  the  i guess on that point, my only, my only reason for raising this with you is on that point, it's not enough to say well, the district court assumed this. or for that matter, the state trial court assumed this. that is not the same thing as putting in the evidence.
they felt otherwise.
challenging the dna evidence. that is not the  the state of the evidence in this case, but 
if there's some additional evidence, we could not say was necessarily  would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. and would be  that's not our situation.
justice stevens, i apologize, i'm not familiar with that disclaimer.
well, i would 
there is  i believe it's under the exhaustion requirement. the court has the option of dismissing the entire action  actually, i believe there the petitioner gets the option, do they want to proceed on the exhausted claims or do they want to drop out the unexhausted claims.
how does that, if the evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.
and on the basis that the constitution requires you to be able to relitigate the same matter two times in the same criminal proceeding, that doesn't seem, to me, right.
i mean, you don't seem to be doing that.
how is it different here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for a certain period, and then it's being released later, at a subsequent time? why 
 the goats from the sheep or whatever 
that's right.
the government argues that a.s. kreider has relevance to this case and i will submit to the court that it does not. the analysis in a.s. kreider about a more specific statute following a general statute controlling was based upon the peculiar syntax of the statute in question. the analysis in a.s. kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in the negative and that therefore all it did was set an outside time limit that congress was free to shorten with a subsequent statute. we do not have that situation in this case. there was  there is no similar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.
 i want to give you a chance, because you're quite right in thinking that i'm moved, in large part  or worried, in large part  not about this language, but about the change in federal criminal law. and the change in federal criminal law, if you're right, way beyond this case, would transform virtually every threat of violence made anywhere in the united states into a serious federal crime. at the least, it would  and make a major change in threats of violence on the picket line. and those are two aspects of the same thing. and i'm worried about the upsetting of expectations way outside the context of this case and making a major change in federal labor law, for example.
is that not correct?
but i do think by contrast if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know, perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, i official think we'd call that murder, and in fact congress passed another statute 
we believe, obviously, congress had the right to abrogate sovereign immunity 
no. no. i think that 
well when you talk about the statutory focus, your innovation test  i mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of nonobviousness? or is it an additional test beyond what the statute requires?
it can be. it might or might not be depending on the circumstances. the morse case is an example where it was both indefinite and invalid because trying to claim a principle of nature, in effect. but by the same token you can easily have, and in fact you have here, a claim where it's definite in that persons of ordinary skill in the art understand the scope of the claims. they know what is and is not within the scope of the patent, which is, in this case, a question entirely separate from the question whether, as construed by the court and as understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art, it's valid, under section 101, that is, under the scope of patentable subject matter.
there is a reasonableness limit, and we've  we've 
which is not this case.
 that's why i said that it would be subject to a pretext analysis. the employer, of course, might come back and  and, post hoc, come up with a rationale for 
your honor, actually, it happens all the time. pennsylvania imposes a tax on state-sold liquor. north carolina does it. all the state-run liquor stores are subject to a state-imposed tax. but 
what if the rem 
well 
it is, justice stevens, and i'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they would have to go as far as you suggested they would go under the city of lacrosse case. the idea that in order to have the ten commandments monument on the capitol grounds, the state of texas has to cordon that monument off, unlike any other of the 17 monuments, suggests a hostility to religion. i think the idea that there has to be a fence away from the ten commandments to make clear that the state has nothing to do with the ten commandments is bending over too far in the other direction. the state can have, as this court has acknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments of religion. and i don't think in this case that the state of texas has gone too far. one other point i think that is important to put on the table, and it is consistent with the analysis of both the district court and the fifth circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the first instance, they now have an additional secular purpose in retaining the monument. and i would point this court to judge becker's analysis in the chester county case for the third circuit. in that case, he had a display that was admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much more overtly sectarian version of the ten commandments. it had the ten commandments plus the summary of the ten commandments from the new testament. and nonetheless, judge becker said that in that case, the monument had been there since 1920 and chester county had a legitimate secular purpose in maintaining that document and maintaining the plaque on the courthouse. and i think he correctly understood that in these cases of displays that have stood for 40 years or longer, that the state is in something of a dilemma. thank you, your honor.
well, i don't have any statistics. i'm sure the fbi keeps statistics on at least federal warrants. but it's true that in a large number of warrants, the police don't find what they're looking for, because probable cause is a standard that is not particularly high.
that they were looking for weapons.
you would say that they can do it so long as they charge less than out of state people 
when you talk about the text, though  and i understand that the "may" language here has been read by the court in very different ways, depending upon the statute  but you have a statute that literally alternates sentences between "shall/may," "shall/may," and it seems to me that if your rule is closer to "shall" than "may," it seems that it was an odd choice of words for congress to employ.
well, under the, under the answer that you gave to the chief justice and the rule you propose, what of the case of differing ownership?
yes, your honor. in fact, there's a wide, wide continuum. at the one end, there is the standard  the pure tariff. on the other end, there is providing training for workers or infrastructure for a plant. this court has clearly recognized that tariffs are unconstitutional. there is no suggestion that providing training or infrastructure would be. all of those have the same economic effect.
i'm sorry, your honor. all the bankruptcy practitioners and courts are clear that to the extent that fobian applies, it applies only to unsecured creditors. but again this is a rational predicate to this court's analysis of fobian. how do we know?
it's called chapter 13 day?
nothing that i have seen has suggested that 
we don't  we don't use 18 for everything. aren't there states that  that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16?
and i appreciate  i appreciate the question.
yeah. let me  let me look at what  let me look at 175. this is, this what he says. "after careful study, i concluded that the suggested process"  this means of piping the sludge out  "would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic wastes to the environment. i also noted based on my analysis of chemical processes at rocky flats that that the sludge and liquid present in the  present in the evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and radioactive substances at rocky flats." i mean, that's all very good, but it has nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, which is not  cutting down on the amount of cement it was adding.
well, mr. olson, the solicitor general tells us that  and here we have  you have the statute, but they have the kaul case that suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.
in fact, that's not even raised by respondents. it's raised by amici's 
you're talking about the federal statute 
of answering the question.
then how do you get off the dime?
the  well, certainly what the  what the evidence was in shrink was it was a $1,075 limit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375 adjusted for inflation compared to the buckley limits, and because of the paucity of evidence and the fact that it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit could give rise to corruption because 
but it isn't 
well 
yes, exactly so, justice souter. and in the thompson case itself, the  the texas court says, when the probate court admitted the 1989 will to probate, it necessarily found that mr. thompson signed the will with testamentary capacity and that it reflected his intent, was not the result of coercion or under influence, and was valid. and the court continued, as a matter of law, the final probate court judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance 
well, the  the reason why that's not a problem is that there is no economic effect that attaches to not working on the forklift for a year or for 10 years. the  the proof in this case is absolutely clear.
that's correct, a very tough standard.
well, your honor, i think  i think that in the habeas cases the court has consistently read "exhaustion" as referring simply to "no remedies presently available."
 didn't file 
no, but if the government and everybody agrees that the joint venture is perfectly lawful, i'm still not quite sure your answer to the chief justice's question. if they can fix the price of a single brand, why can't they fix the price of  of two brands at the same time?
i mean 
justice kennedy, it  under their  under the regulations of this municipality, which is  is perfectly representative, it is final agency action when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you choose to appeal it to the city council. and there is  not only is there nothing peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the violation by a state and local government of an express federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the right was violated but also that you were really damaged. it's  i'm not suggesting that  that congress had damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. you have said in a variety of instances  i mentioned stacura in particular  that 1983 damages do serve as a deterrent to violation of federal rights by municipal local officials. but what congress had  congress had to come up with some way to confront this problem in which there were sort of local parochial 
well, the fact that there may be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less of an employee benefit. the question is whether there is a plan that provides employee benefits, and the insurance coverage provided by workers' compensation are clearly employee benefits. i also  and  and, of course, the with  with respect to that tradeoff, that's  that tradeoff is an employee benefit too, justice ginsburg, because the  the employee has no-fault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to sue and wait years, doesn't lose his or her job as a result of the injury or as a result of bringing the lawsuit. so i don't think you can make the judgment that it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of that fact. and of course, voluntarily provided benefits also benefit the employer by making it a more attractive place to work and  and 
but how would an inmate who was objecting to this racial segregation go about proving such a case? you said one would have to rely on experts.
yes. that is correct, justice ginsburg  ginsburg. those were essentially, except for a few words here and there, those were the same regulations. but they were in response to a congressional directive back in 1974 that the secretary is to create the equalization formula. in 1994, congress came in with legislation and established that formula.
that's correct, your honor.
yes. you're right.
yes.
"knowingly corruptly."
yes, but in  at page 109, what this court said  it talked about the s-9 pump, which was central there, because it was moving the body  that the  the water. it was transmitting it. and it was  talked about pumping the water from one part of the water body to the other. that's a discharge, even though it's the same water body.
the epa is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the sec is. it has not been given an entire industry to regulate.
justice ginsburg, i don't have any data on that, and we haven't  we don't have any in our brief. the solicitor general's data that he put in on the federal bureau of prisons came in his reply brief, and we certainly haven't had 
am i right or not?
you would be closer to justice scalia's case, justice stevens, yes. although under washington law, we analyze the charging document and the sufficiency of it and ask whether or not it was  the words used sufficiently appraised the defendant. but i think the defendant would have a stronger argument for the fact that he didn't know what he was facing if you had that hypothetical.
is that right or not?
but is it not equal because of the message it sends or because it denies the opportunity to recruit as effectively?
no, your honor. there was a motion for a remittitur 
no, your honor. i certainly agree with the first point. one issue before this court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. but as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.
no. we have defective warning too, and  and if i can address that as well. the statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or misleading statement in the label as to any particular. our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are grown. that was false. under the statute, that is a misbranding, and that is actionable as  both as a failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of warranty. now, the medtronic majority made absolutely clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in fact all nine justices agreed that when the state law claim is parallel to the federal requirements, the existence of a state law remedy is not an additional requirement.
 i know it says that, but that doesn't necessarily take you any further than saying that if the words of the statute refer to something that could be a state law felony, under the  under the penultimate sentence, it will count. it does not necessarily answer the question that we have, and that is whether a particular reference in the statute is a reference to a federal felony or a state felony. so, it has a  the penultimate sentence has work to do. and, in fact, we can see the work being done in the  in the very definition of "drug trafficking"  but it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it.
and as we point out in the reply brief, the judge had taken a strong legal position 20 years earlier that the requirements of the act could be waived.
well, i 
and i would point out, justice stevens, that congress has made it clear that the impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted districts. it is not supposed to fund the general educational program of a state. the money that the state, that the state of new mexico seeks to retain is under a limited exception that has been created and it is, it is not that we are trying to take the state's money as the bottom line. it is that the state has taken the impact aid dollars and doesn't have an equalized system. new mexico could equalize if it wants to. it established its equalization formula.
but the verdict that the jury returns is a verdict of death. they do not return a verdict saying, "we're in equipoise," and then the death sentence is imposed by operation of law. the verdict imposed is, "we do not find  we find these aggravating circumstances. we find they're not outweighed. and, therefore, we sentence the defendant to death."
 sheriff's department  -
yes, but he was picked 
doesn't your approach require an employer to keep shuffling the employees around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession of particular types of job responsibilities?
would you 
to me, once a person is told that he is not going to be under arrest, it changes the whole complexion of the case. i think it's a completely different  a completely different scenario. we don't have an arrest. it doesn't matter. atwater 
that's correct, your honor, but they would have no precedential effect in his case.
well, for the precise purpose at issue here, i think it makes a lot of difference. you can fund private people for some things, and not fund them for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say government speech. i think that's a 
justice souter, it's different in this sense. this is an indemnity, all-loss indemnity provision. the surety is not supposed to incur any loss, any cost whatsoever, for supplying these surety bonds to pg&e.
i agree. and they 
the threat 
we think immunity extends beyond what is expressly permitted by the sec. the way the court phrased it in nasd was things that are connected to the agency's regulatory responsibility have to be immunized to allow the agency to do its task. and that extends a little bit further than the permission standard that the government has given. and there 
what is the, the court saying  and this is on page 39 a of the petition appendix  when harris was driving away from officers and when there, when there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's assertion that at the time of the ramming, harris posed an immediate threat of harm to others. this is a finding that there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming occurred.
it is still on the books. a point is made in the reply brief, it is not a binding resolution, it encourages the county judge executive to post the ten commandments as part of a historic display. it doesn't say post a display of documents and have a county judge choose to post the ten commandments. the initial paragraph of the resolution makes clear that it encourages the county judge to post the ten commandments and then as part of a historic display. the county judge did that. the district court enjoined that display. the county appealed that injunction and then, after getting new lawyers, dropped its appeal. soon after that, the county posted a third display, again, the ten commandments with what it called historic documents, leaving aside how the stars spangled banner or the national motto as a historic document. what it did is wrap the ten commandments in the three or four secular documents that we all clearly acknowledge as the root of the american system of government. it did so pursuant to the same resolution. there has never been another resolution, it has not been rescinded. the resolution is there. it cites jesus christ as the prince of ethics, it cites legislative allusions to jesus christ. i think the resolution, which is cited in the joint appendix of the docket number, makes it clear that the purpose of this county was to post the ten commandments and to do so because of the religious nature of the ten commandments because of the primacy in its view of the ten commandments. that's what it focused on. that's what this litigation history has revealed throughout and that's what the district court found at least at the preliminary injunction stage, which is where we still are. there has been no evidence taken in the case, no discovery taken in the case to suggest anything other than what the district court found. and on this record, i submit that there can be no conclusion other than that the purpose of the county in posting the series of displays was to post the ten commandments because of their religious nature and the effect on the reasonable observer who knew what was going on, who was there to see what was transpiring in this small county was clear to the district court. the district court doesn't operate in a vacuum. and this court has made clear that courts cannot turn a blind eye to a sham secular purpose. the district court not only saw the displays, heard the arguments of counsel, saw the resolutions of the district court, of the fiscal court. the fiscal court is the legislative branch of government in kentucky. the district court also was there in the community and could see both the public reaction, the letters to the editor, the keep the ten commandments signs on yards throughout the county.
we did not, your honor.
well, what do you think sony allowed? it talked about  if it's, what, capable of substantial noninfringing use, it's okay?
 can i come back to rust versus sullivan? you say that that was a government speech case? i had not recollected it as a government speech case.
would you measure the mens rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the dilation a day or two before the actual operation is performed, or is it at the time of beginning the operation?
yes.
the judge could do that if he felt that that was  was appropriate for one of the elements. the  one of the elements is you didn't have an  a reasonable opportunity to not do the crime. in her mind, she did not believe she did because she believed that there was somebody at home with a gun threatening her children. and i'm out of time. thank you.
the position as far as what black is saying?
i see, but it was present in davis, davis v. passman, to which justice kennedy referred, already recognized a bivens action for violating something even more capacious, due process, equal protection. when this court said in village of willowbrook against oleck that there is a cause of action even for the naked assertion that you're treating me differently, did that open huge floodgates? have we been flooded? it seems to me that the court has developed its own filters against the floodgate of retaliation claims. it's been 
and even with letting him go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to catch him?
 because that wasn't the one i asked. the one i wanted answered was the question of i understand that point, which we could say it was definitely not definite the last time. i'm asking you  it's a serious question  as whether there was something new or different that came up when the fifth circuit wrote this. now, i gathered from your answer, it might be yes, and if the answer is yes, i want you to say what it is because i'm interested.
michigan does have a current license for out-state seller of wine. you know, these players 
they 
no. it's not murder. it wasn't  you know, he didn't  i didn't walk up to the  to the car intending to kill him. as you say, you couldn't have indicted for murder.
well, and 
and what if it's for 
isn't it ordinarily true 
 pure and simple 
yes it does. it does. i promise. (laughter.)
they denied it, but as i read what the ohio court said after the denial, i thought it did probably rest upon their determination that stumpf had pulled the trigger.
then your 
so what if the plan said  you know, this is an insurance company. they don't like litigation  we are subrogated to double whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed? that's our recovery. it's an equitable claim, but it's going to be enforced according to the terms of the plan.
well, i'm not sure whether it could have been brought at that time. but the fact of the matter is a challenge was brought on this issue in  to the 1980 regulations. true, duke didn't assert it, but general motors and the steel industry did assert in the 1981 brief they filed in that challenge to the 1980 rule 
there was some concern prior to '86 by congress that ferc was doing just that. and that's why congress told, in 1986, long after the statute was passed, that ferc has to make specific findings if it disagrees with the state. additionally, congress gave to the department of interior, under section 18, certain powers to dictate to ferc, for example, fish passages. ferc has no choice on those. so, congress  this reference to cooperative federalism clearly was in congress's mind, but it wasn't a cooperative federalism in which, on all issues in all proceedings, all the state needed to do is tell ferc what to do. but they 
so the magistrate is always looking to the condition when  when the warrant is executed, and that's all that's happening here. there is probable cause to believe that this person will be receiving contraband. there is probable cause to believe it because he sent for it and it was mailed to him. it's just a matter of waiting till it gets there. there is probable cause to believe that he will receive it. and all you're doing is predicting in the future, saying the probable cause doesn't exist now, but it exists when the warrant will be executed. i don't see  i don't see any real difference between that and the  and the mob leader example i just 
 correct.
pardon me?
i do not. and i do not because at this point apparently nine circuits are following the rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b) as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required. one can go through each of the six prongs and easily hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1), (b)(2) 
well, your system is the one that gives a choice to the individuals.
we thank the court.
the  the 
i suppose if you could, if you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components. then if you used  if you're going to make 100 machines. if you used for your disk the master disk for the last copy, then that would have been  that would  then the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last machine.
once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question. once it is in the court. and it was in the court in  in prima paint. the question is does it have to go first to the court before it goes to the arbitrator, and  and prima paint doesn't decide that question.
 consent 
yes.
but are they 
i don't see how your point regarding union helps you any because if  if you  if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor union, you still have, as  as the end of this definition, any union or group of individuals.
suppose the state says, "we don't consider late claims."
why  the ultimate question i think is the one justice alito asked. i think, as i read the icj treaty, we're under a legal obligation in this country to provide a reasonable, effective remedy. and why isn't that a reasonably effective remedy? treat it, you know, like any other problem where the client should have learned something and he didn't. if the lawyer is there, this is the obligation. the lawyer tells him, and if the lawyer fails to tell him, then that's ineffective assistance in an appropriate circumstance, or if it isn't, it isn't. but that's a good remedy. what's wrong with that? and the other obligation is, counsel, you have to raise this issue as soon as everybody learns about it, in which case you might be out because i don't  he's certainly learned about it by the time he was on appeal, and as i read your brief here, he didn't raise it on appeal either.
they were  they were liable for a tax greater than what they took in. those were pointed to congress 
then i don't know why you're not out of court on totten.
well, the prosecutor's closing was schizophrenic, because he said, "but really this shouldn't matter."
this is  it  well, i don't think it's comparable because the district court finding was that the documents that the government relies on were not involved in the adjudication at all. so it 
 not a wait.
that's true, but the paycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the much more common case in which somebody doesn't derive notice of the potential discrimination until the discrimination has been repeated over time.
well, did  did you respond to the summary judgment by saying, you know, there are reasons why they should  specific reasons why they shouldn't get the full 75?
i  it's  there's certainly not enough there to make the argument that he's making, i don't think, because what was  what congress did was to replace that provision with utter silence. and from that utter silence, i don't think there's any way to read into it that congress meant for the applicability of section 1231(a)(5) 
 it doesn't insist 
because it was an arbitrary denial of a forum in which to hear the avena judgement claim, not simply the  a different source of right. in other words, although the avena judgement claim comes up on texas as a proposition as a  under a treaty, the action of the court of appeals was to deny that claim without giving it a forum. that is to say, without  that  before it had been raised itself, before it even existed  because the effect of the court of appeals was to give effect to a procedural default of a right that hadn't come into effect. and, therefore, in that context, it's effectively a due process claim.
what 
this was truly even before the troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?
it doesn't insist that you do anything. it says that, "if you want our money, you have to let our recruiters on campus."
absolutely, mr. chief justice, but i don't think this case poses the same problems as city of boerne. first of all, this really isn't an effort to rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that rfra was. congress in this legislation targeted two areas where there were particular problems with respect to religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a different standard. now, as i say, that standard is higher, but so are the standards of over half of the states which also apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of state constitutional law or state law.
 i think the question  maybe it just  i don't understand, totally, how the clean water act works, but i thought that what we're talking in this statute is a state rule that's called the state clean water act rule. it's a creature of the clean water act, isn't it? a water quality standard?
he couldn't get the 5,000 bonus for being a spy. right?
when you say that it asks what other employers receive, but these institutions, i gather, would not allow other employers, who have the same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to interview at their institutions. so, you're receiving what other employers in the same situation would receive.
you're saying this instruction was too favorable to you 
all the time. and  and the other side of that coin 
no, he doesn't in a summary judgment case either. i mean, i've had quite a few of them, i used to, i think, where they just wrote denied. that was the opinion.
but you  i'm 
i think 
justice stevens, and may it please the court: petitioners submit that the age discrimination in employment act prohibits an employment practice that has a significant disparate impact on older workers if that practice lacks any reasonable business justification. the adea embodies congress' determination that age discrimination seriously impedes older americans' ability to participate fairly in the american work force.
but the justification under the federal system could be, you know, this is what the sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence for this crime. i disagree with that. now, there are other authorities who think that that's a little too, you know, below what it ought to be. he can simply disagree with the sentencing guidelines. or he could point out what justice breyer suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a special problem with regard to this kind of a crime. he can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact. he cannot do that in california.
you  you think it could not have been considered in mitigation in the decision whether to give a death sentence?
a frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road 
both, justice ginsburg. first of all, in many cases, such as this one, where the police don't actually destroy the door, it would be very hard to quantify the damages, and it would be very hard to find a lawyer to take a case such as this. but the second barrier is the various immunities, tort immunities. in section 1983 actions, there are qualified immunities that make it difficult to win a suit. and because it is not a bright line as to when the police officers have to knock and announce, and when they do not  that is, is there a reasonable suspicion that a quick entry or a no-knock entry will be met with violence or that the evidence will be destroyed?  courts tend to be very generous in granting qualified immunity to officers  that is, concluding that some reasonable officers might have concluded that it was justified to dispense with the knock-and-announcement requirement.
i conceive that interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a school where kids go around at public events publicly making a joke out of drugs. that's what his thought is. now, i don't think he has to be able to read content discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place. he doesn't know the law, the principal. his job is to run the school. and so i guess what i'm worried about is a rule that would  is on your side, a rule that takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing limits all over the place in the high schools. but a rule that against your side may really limit people's rights on free speech. that's what i'm struggling with. now, i want some help there and i'm worried about the principal.
but this does  justice souter, this highlights why the triggering event must be clearly, specifically drawn by a magistrate with studied caution about the exact factors for probable cause which would allow this search. and if it's buried in some affidavit somewhere, if it's not on the front of the warrant, or if it's vested in the discretion of the officer to make that determination whether that's close enough, then it is prone to these abuses and it is  requires the magistrate to make that final legal determination.
there wasn't even  yes, there was some evidence that he was within a mile 
well, i'm not so sure.
justice kennedy 
it would  they would typically  in a multi-employer plan, as many of our priority claimants are here, because the money is spread, the employees still get some money. but if we consider the greater whole, the money, the available res, the available pot, to play those  pay those employees is diminished. so 
the respondent's reply to this  this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the  the two white prospective jurors who had  who had expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had expressed antagonism to the death penalty. now, is that not true?
justice ginsburg, a different lawyer gets appointed in the federal court system than represented him in the  in the state court system.
they don't 
well, johns 
of course the petitioners have not had an opportunity, i would think  they filed a complaint. but they've not had an opportunity to argue this out in front of the sec with particular evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.
no, my 
and 
well, we don't  we don't have to be that harsh. we can  i don't think that's the question. i think the question is under what circumstances can you correct the error without having formally acted to extend the time for issuance of the mandate. i think one can draw a distinction between the court just sitting there and doing nothing for a year and a half and  and then, you know, during which it's reconsidering the case without notice to anybody, and a situation in which a court takes formal action. we're extending the time. we could have a much lower standard for the latter than  than for the former.
 up in muniz a little bit? because that was a prison administration. and so, what is the private-party analog to that?
whatever right  in  in a criminal prosecution the bill of rights would apply to that person.
let's assume the title is aboriginal. nothing in an act of the united states says we're giving this land to the indians, e.g., in the kansas situation. it's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished. are you saying that if that is the source of the title as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you, that it cannot be indian country?
the brief in opposition at the ninth circuit you're referring to or 
because in those days the government was arguing it should be like state officials.
mr. chief justice, we do not have an interest in the aedpa question because it does not apply to federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and there is no federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so we are not telling you that you should or should not reach it. we just don't have an interest in that question.
we did argue, and we do argue, that the fourth circuit could reasonably conclude, on burden-of-proof grounds, that it was not satisfied that the texas corporation was a corporate entity. but the argument that i've been using 
well, do you think in this case you'd be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of law?
or end of argument, not end of case. (laughter.)
and so, it 
on page 24, i read the or wrong.
counsel, i thought you said that you did know what it was. i thought you simply quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state. that's what's being distributed.
that's correct. the common law element  malicious prosecution requires that the innocence or grounds not consistent with guilt, but there's no such element in the common law false imprisonment, which would accrue when you are released from being in prison, which would benefit mr. wallace in this case. when the seventh circuit talked about there are three alternatives that we have to choose from, the proof immediately, the case by case of when it accrues, or it only accrues at the end of the case, they didn't consider the fourth possibility of the common law rule that it occurs when the imprisonment ends.
that's an abrogation, that's not 
i thought in 
i  i certainly recognize that, your honor. the  the provision of (a)(3) and (a)(4)  they work in tandem to protect the workers. they share a cap. the more a worker benefits from a wage priority, the less the worker benefits from the  from the employee benefit plan priority. and so they work together; they work in tandem, which gives meaning to (a)(4) under many of the canons of construction that  that we're familiar with. it would not work  it's an anomaly that an insurance company receivable would share the cap with the wages priority. that is simply an anomaly. and when we look to the legislative history, it is absolutely clear, your honor, that the fact of the judicial  the statutory mandate for workers' compensation insurance is very important because what is spoken about, as judge niemeyer pointed out in his dissent below  what is spoken about in the legislative history over and over again is a wage substitute or a wage surrogate that employers do not give  will lower the wages but provide fringe benefits. so the package remains the same. now, that's not a workers' compensation insurance policy, but that is the wage surrogates that the congress was looking at.
well, there are slight differences in the language, but i don't think that's dispositive because title vii of the civil rights act, which this court addressed in the aramco case, the court  the chief justice's opinion there said that that language was not enough to express the intent.
that's true, mr. chief justice. our main submission is that the ninth circuit relied on an issue of aiding and abetting. we petitioned on that question and the court granted certiorari on that question. the three grounds on which respondent relies on defense of the judgment, even though they all vary in some sense from the ninth circuit's ground, two of them simply have nothing to do with aiding and abetting. the first ground is an aiding and abetting argument. it's slightly different from the one, slightly narrower than the one on which the ninth circuit relied, but we think it's fairly included and we think the court should address it. we think the court should reject it for the reasons i am attempting to articulate now. if you have a jurisdiction with a law of aiding and abetting that is broader, it can be characterized as broader in some sense than what might be thought to be the general notion of aiding and abetting, under the premise of respondent's theory, you could conceivably have this kind of argument in any removal case 
but the  if you accept the proposition that the river is divided into two different things, then you can start to talk about a discharge of one thing into the other. but miccosukee makes clear that the structure of a dam does not keep us from viewing this as a single body of water which flows through a dam. it does not flow "into the navigable waters"; the navigable waters themselves flow through the dam.
thank you.
we haven't told  no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not telling congress, "you can't do what you have done." we're saying, "congress hasn't done this."
well, i've looked at those procedures and it seems to me that those are interpreted as what should happen in the ordinary case. they certainly don't preclude making a phone call and there can be phone calls for warrants in criminal cases in new hampshire. that's specifically provided.
well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?
so, it's not the cases that congress wanted to be removed that we're talking about.
well, if that  if that's permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be the way trials are conducted when  when there are mid-trial motions like yours? every judge is going to say, yes, looks as though you  you got them there, but i'll  i'll just hold onto this until things are over, and then i'll rule. that's  that's the way they're all going to respond, isn't it?
mr. salmons, doesn't the plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption that what the  that the cause of action at the time the  that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer is a cause of action which has the same value as the ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets? whereas, in fact, the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the lawyer has an inchoate value. the  the value that is actually realized is going to depend in part on the  on the skill and  and the  the gumption of the lawyer. so that the  what i'm getting at  and  and going to justice kennedy's question, it seems to me that the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two different figures. and i don't see realistically how the client has complete control over the value realized, which we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and gotten the check.
my answer to that is that that might be a  a legislative policy decision to make that distinction. but in 1996, iirira abolished the distinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens after they've been ordered removed. up until that time, it makes a difference. it makes a difference under the constitution. but once they've been ordered removed  and this was the government's argument in zadvydas. once they've been ordered removed, regardless of how they got here in the first place, they no longer have any right to be here at all and 
it's 
no, actually negligent or wrongful acts are covered. there's 2680(h), which covers a number of intentional torts and  it's often referred to as the intentional-tort exception. but, actually, it wouldn't cover  the  bopping with a package would probably be assault. but if we deliver a package that has anthrax in it, i don't know that that would be covered. maybe we would try and argue 
yick wo.
it is a holding. it's a lower court opinion. it's not the 
we really don't. i mean, we concede that if the  i mean, 8-  924(c), the criminal statute, says nothing about state law. it says nothing about any conviction under federal or state law. it's simply a official question of whether the conduct is punishable, capable of being punished, under the controlled substances act 
 and  but  and so 
or go to mexico, and you can come back in 5 years.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i think respondents have embraced the logical consequences of their position. and what it results in is turning the controlled substances act, the federal controlled substances act, into an odd patchwork. it also is profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the harrison act of 1914  which the controlled substances act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this court pointed out in moore  at that time, the states had a variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and other  and cocaine and other substances  opium and cocaine now of which land on schedule 2. some of them tightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over-the-counter tonics in large quantities. and the point of the harrison act was to clean that up and impose a uniform federal regime. and they knew it would have an impact on state regulation of medicine. and even the court, in the linder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a constitutional problem.
it would apply, your honor, if, if that factual determination were relevant to scope of employment under the applicable law, namely the agency law of kentucky.
this case doesn't involve an emergency situation. this is a facial challenge. there is no case at issue at all.
which  which was kind of said in passing to say that there was no  that the  that the court below was right and we shouldn't take the case.
the  the new policy, which really was in all honesty, your honor, a tweaked policy or a modified policy  they took the old policy and they made some changes to it. the question before the court is whether that new policy fixed the problems. we saw the problems 
that 
your honor, it is a fundamental principle of administrative law and deference to agency decisionmaking that when congress adopts an ambiguous statutory phrase and charges the agency with implementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking authority to choose from among the various permissible interpretations.
i think that that conclusion implicitly includes a finding that agent bigbee was  was credible and dr. blake was not credible.
well, your honor, if congress had said that, they certainly could have made that decision, but it would run completely contrary to almost 200 years of precedent from this court that as a general rule, the limitations period does not begin to run before your cause of action even comes into existence.
but there is a difference, and this is  assume with me, which apparently you don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances. i have never found an instance where you couldn't think of some exception that they didn't see. you could not bring a thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would ensue or a murder. assume that, all right. official then the question would be, well, what about this instance? and i think the strongest instance  the strongest argument for saying there's is no exception here is the argument that the trustee discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly, that he's hidden assets. maybe he has a safe deposit box and he has a key and the key  the key will allow him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide them. under 7, the trustee has the key. as soon as you convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor, who has been shown dishonest. now, assuming you're going to have some exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?
right.
what am i supposed to do? i mean, i'll look again at the tape. i certainly will do that. but suppose i look at the tape and i end up with chico marx's old question with respect to the court of appeals: who do you believe, me or your own eyes?
what should  what  was wesley then denied due process? because at the time of stumpf's initial plea hearing, eastman hadn't appeared and there was only stumpf's testimony that he was not the triggerman and the prosecutor's evidence that he was. then we get to wesley, and eastman shows up. the prosecutors have already taken the position that stumpf was the triggerman. is wesley denied due process because they're taking inconsistent positions at his trial?
your honor, i'd  i'd like to  to move back the discussion to there's no attorney yet, and the question is what can that person do. and  and the error 
why, though, would we have a special rule in this respect for habeas cases? same question i've had throughout. treat it like any other civil case.
why did they say they needed it? i mean, why do you need all this ph.d. guy up there? why don't you just prove what you just said?
well, if they are plainly illegal, then there are remedies in the courts.
and the discrimination occurred over a period of a couple of years, as i understand it.
to document, to document his trespasses on other lands, and that's  the citation to the ibla decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief and it discusses that allegation in depth. in any event 
i think it is a tough line. i think this is the kind of line district judges have to draw. i think if you look at your own precedents like anderson versus liberty lobby and all of those jury trial cases, you see the repetition of the notion that judges do not balance inference chains on a matter going to the core function of a jury.
denying benefits, for example.
so this would put national banks in a favored position compared to corporations 
may i ask 
wherever it is because i look at it as a public safety exception. and this court in the edmond case specifically condemned a general search  a general crime  let me use the exact words. general interest in crime control, to quote the edmond case. and that's 
approximately $6,000 because the property was sold for $21,000. the minimum bid was the assessed value of the property, which in arkansas is 20 percent of the fair market value. so that was about $14,000. plus about $4,000 in back taxes, another 10 percent in interest, and another 10 percent in penalties, and some small, in this instance, costs of notice. but that brings us to an important point, is that the cost of notice and the cost of a search to find a better address will not be borne by the state. it will be borne either by the owner as a cost of redeeming the property or it will be borne by the purchaser as a cost of acquiring the property. so certainly here where we have an $80,000 house sold for $21,000, there was sufficient margin to allow for some costs to find mr. jones so that he could be informed without making this property 
or  or somebody who was convicted of treason in cuba? you  you think that  that that would be a  a case that would be prosecuted vigorously by a united states attorney?
well, that's  that's a third case but that's not the question we have here, is it?
now, it may be felt 
but it's just one court.
justice cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. the scholars are going to have to debate it for years.
justice scalia, i think in some you could and in others you couldn't. and  and that's an important  important point.
only if they persevere in that decision-making, and prosecutors urge them not to by telling them that they must impose death when they cannot decide the balance between aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
thank you.
this is a new framework, i take it, and it's very interesting. and one of the things that interests me  i guess, on your framework, lopez should have come out my way. [laughter.]
i agree that that would not be actionable under the robinson-patman act. the reasons why  the reason, or reasons, why depend on whether they are in head-to-head competition or not. if they're never in head-to-head competition, then they're never in competition 
but you  so you are  you are proposing one way to reconcile kansas city. you say, well, that's the constitutional claim. but why isn't it at least as good a reconciliation to say once you go through  there's  there's a federal claim  there's a federal question that's dispositive of this case, and you agree that that's so here. the whole thing turns on the meaning and effect of that notice provision. so the federal question is what determines this case, and you satisfy the well-pleaded complaint standard. then at that point, when you satisfy the basic kansas city title & trust provisions, then to see which way to swing, why isn't it appropriate to say is this a case where the state has a large interest and the federal interest is not significant? or, on the other hand, is it a case where there is a large federal interest in seeing how this comes out?
that's different. look  it could  could  would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. you shouldn't find him guilt. is there no mercy in your heart?" would he be allowed to argue that? of course not. can he argue it in a guilt phase? of course he can. and it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make. the defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called upon to kill somebody. do you realize what a  what a difficult, overwhelming thing that is? and then you say the prosecution can't come in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do your duty, you have to kill. this is the law here. if you find the facts this way, that's your duty. i  i  i think you're, you're taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure that we've set up in capital cases which is called the guilt  uh, the penalty phase.
yes.
here we have a case essentially described by justice kennedy in & haga, where we have a different statutory scheme combined with a explicit statement by the agency as to which part of that scheme the agency is operating under. but the case i would cite, or the cases would be rolo and rove which have not 
the christian science monitor is not available to him in the  in the mini law library, and  and actually, if he wanted to subscribe, he could receive a  a legal periodical in his cell.
correct. but whatever the reason, it is correct.
but i suppose somebody on the committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in japan rather than in brooklyn really doesn't make any difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.
 that wants a substantive response, do you respond by saying they're right, we're spies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?
certainly not under taylor. the whole idea of taylor was partly dictated by the words of the statute.
yes.
see, i  i 
i believe in  in  this court announced, justice o'connor, in the berger opinion that for a wiretap warrant to be authorized under the fourth amendment, there must be a crime undertaken, presently being committed, or about to be committed, additional evidence of a crime that's already been committed. there is present probable cause. and it also, i do not believe, vests the discretion in the officers to completely control when probable cause will occur.
 i mean, you can ask mr. garre what his view is with respect to the waiting on the position of the solicitor general here. but it still seems to me that there is a fundamental difference between the way the d.c. circuit is analyzing this case and  and the way this court analyzed it ellerth. and the fundamental difference is  i agree with you. there are other circumstances that are not tangible employment actions that are, nevertheless, actionable under both 703 and 704, but those are  those are taken care of under the meritor standards. the  the assumption is that they are both retaliatory in purpose and that they are severe or pervasive.
how many cases would have to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?
with all respect 
it could  it could have a  it could be a citizen of the state where its  its papers say its main office is and also the state where, in fact, its main office is.
no. precisely, if i recall  and you correct me if i'm wrong, but i thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were  were not evidence. of course, they're not evidence. the issue isn't whether they were evidence. they were statements of the law. the judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law. it seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.
but you're taking as your prime  or a prime example of what would be covered by the exception of "negligent transmission" the package that is delivered to the right place on time and all the china inside the box is smashed. i mean, that would be an example that would fit your theory.
where 
i'm not sure that was a 4 diligent sort of a  an effort.
i think so, yes, your honor.
the problem is that it conflicts with federal rule of civil procedure rule 8. and as this court this repeatedly said, including as recently as last term in hill v. mcdonough, the court will not impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an amendment to the federal rules of civil procedure.
a disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional. however, it's our contention 
i  i agree completely. i would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this court has said over and over again. if you  the purpose of the antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, because competition between competing manufacturers give the consumers more choice. some people may want the cheapest product. some people may want the product that's more available to them. they may wish the return policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that the dealer provides. and in this marketplace particularly, that system of providing competition is consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced success in the marketplace.
 weed out the sheep from the lambs 
i agree with you, your honor. it's angels on the pin of a needle, i guess is the phrase here, and this case may be a case where the difference between chapman and brecht could be of consequence. if you'd look at the district court's treatment of this case, at the district court level the court stated: "mr. fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error," and that court is applying the brecht standard. the district court states: "i cannot rule out prejudice in this case." so seemingly had that court applied chapman, mr. fry would have prevailed in the district court. likewise, in the ninth circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the brecht standard, and then we have the panel majority in ruling against mr. fry on the prejudice issue stating that had pamela maples' testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered mr. fry's claim of independence. that statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under brecht; and even if it's not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the chapman standard, that court would have ruled in mr. fry's 
 that if it's over 90 days, unless you have a reason, it's untimely.
 wasn't there another provision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether the  whether the proceeding is pending? i forget which one it is.
me understanding is that she did. that was denied, because the only time joshua got into 
yes, your honor, i do believe that. congress was legislating, enacted this statute for the purpose of addressing a particular category of section 1983 actions in which it appears that congress reached the conclusion that there was be  there was an abuse of that process under 1983. and so, the purpose of  what this 
no, your honor, i would not, and i'll tell you why i would not.
that's not  the state has to result  the state  it's adjudicated on the merits in state court and results in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law.
our primary submission is that in the context of aiding and abetting, there shouldn't be any generic definition beyond what the states apply, whatever the formulation. our fallback position is essentially what you just described, and we think we should prevail under it because we think we have the federal rule. we think we have the majority rule in the states. and we have the common law rule as well.
again, your honor, the university of kentucky survey, which is in the record 
one would be a fight with her. the other one would be they go in to sue the defendants. now, at this point, she's not necessarily adverse, but she has no interest to help.
well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what i  if  if there was  are you asking me what i would do to modify the injunction? you could merely strike  you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.
and then a particular kind of adjustable pedal. that's the state of the record so far.
well, because we are in the protected harbors of the  of boston harbor 
your honor, every court that has considered that question has said that it has to be analyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis. let me explain the reason. first of all, let me explain what they mean by claim by claim. they really mean a factual theory of falsity, and that it has to be done on a claim by claim basis, and here's why 
the alternative prejudice holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been cumulative.
mr. chief justice, may it please the court: when burlington northern reassigned ms. white from the forklift to the track and then removed her without pay for 37 days during christmas, it, quote, discriminated against ms. white under any reasonable standard, the eeoc standard, the plain language standard, or the standard that the unanimous en banc court of the sixth circuit adopted. whatever standard the court applies, ms. white should prevail, if it's a reasonable standard, other than that of the  of the petitioner.
well, not in all these cases, mr. chief justice.
this 
we disagree with petitioner.
exactly.
i don't think there is, justice stevens, but i wouldn't find that at all remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain procedures without regard to whether the procedure is applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when congress does make specific findings that the procedure official it's banning would have the effect of preventing a lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born. it's not 
the attorney  there were two cases in which the guam supreme court issued a final  its own final ruling after the october 30, 2004 amendment of the organic act. and in that instance, the organic act was in effect. he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this court. there were two cases that were pending in the ninth circuit and over which the ninth circuit had granted the writ, this case and santos. in santos, but not in this case, the court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to the court's continued jurisdiction, and the attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed in our reply brief.
why doesn't it  why doesn't absolutely compel it? where is the ambiguity, you say?
first of all, justice ginsburg, my recollection is that trooper gillette, who was the officer who stopped caballes, did not have a  a dog in the car.
well, there is an effort to make that showing. i don't think that it's been a successful effort to make that showing. in fact i think if you look at the findings of the district courts in these cases, two of the three district courts found that there was no particular condition where the d&x abortion was medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits  official safety benefits. in this case, the nebraska case, the district court identified only two conditions, preeclampsia combined with maternal cancer, and placenta previa. and as to those particular findings as we point out in our reply brief, there are problems with each of those findings.
and  and just to clarify, congress hasn't provided any funds for this. i mean they, they recognized in 2004 they were only funding 19 percent of the obligations of the statute, and we have to pick up the balance of the tab. and their other argument on the spending clause is that it's, you don't have to flesh out everything in the statute but here we're talking about two core issues. one is abrogating the common rule law and the other is creation of substantive rights to an entirely new class of beneficiaries. if there's ever anything that demanded clear notice, this is it. it is much more serious and severe than the expert fees at issue in arlington, and school districts and states simply have to have notice, what is the parameter of the right that you are being requested to recognize? and based on the briefing, and based on what we have heard in argument, it is simply not clear to the school districts not only what the nature of the right is but how to apply it.
well, as justice o'connor explained in her jefferson parish concurrence, there's significant force to that argument. but  but again, it's not presented here because there's 
that would be, to the extent that that  if that is established that could be taken into consideration along with other facts.
 with you more.
can you tell us how often states are creditors in bankruptcies around the country? do you have any idea?
and 
enough for now, justice breyer 
well, but let's get specific. you  you said there isn't a reasonable possibility. why? get  get down to facts. why isn't there a reasonable possibility?
what?
do you  do you dispute  your  your brother on the other side said in his argument that he had not heard a dispute about this. but do you dispute his claim that there has never been any  at least in recent history, any  any civil judgment actually rendered against anyone in the officer's position?
now, congress was silent on this subject of the burden of proof, was it not?
is it not a fair inference that each of the cues noted on the cards was something that the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to challenge the juror? and if so, is it not  does  is that not uncontradicted evidence that the race of the venire person was a factor in the decision?
well, wait, but  you know, in 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the prison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it. but, under this act, you go through your prison remedies, what do you ask the prison for? money? the prison can't give you money, so they say, "no, you can't get your money." i 
they make an argument that under their test, my client should not prevail. i can make an argument under our test my client prevails.
well said, justice rehnquist. what i'm suggesting here is mr. cochran would have been faced with  he has no remedy. injunctive relief is the only remedy. and he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions 
yes, your honor.
well, what about the dog grooming cases?
you're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal.
as a legal matter weak. as a practical matter, i think unfortunately it's going to be very strong. and i think one of the real dangers of an advisory guideline 
 that's entirely correct, and i think we've seen that in  in a couple of the cases that are out there. mr. brown's case out of north carolina followed that track. mr. morales' case somewhat followed that track, although through no fault of mr. morales, california wasn't able to carry through on the alternative that they chose because the anesthesiologists decided to not participate. but it  but it just proceeded to basically an up or down ruling upon the proposed alternatives. so i  i would disagree that there's a seriatim effect of  of just perpetual litigation over whether the alternatives 
recidivism is an element of the crime. if  if you have a crime of, you know, repeated felony, recidivism is an element.
what about the rule provision for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute? the ordinary provision for venue.
 survives the search warrant.
we don't necessarily need to say a violation of fifra is  so long as the requirement is the same, although we can certainly 
what do you say, i mean justice alito asked you a question about the footnote. and i, in all candor i think you told us more about the, your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you basically the same question about what the oregon supreme court meant in the passage that runs from the bottom of 20(a) up to 21. it says "philip morris's official proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other persons were oregonians who were harmed by the same conduct that had harmed williams, and in the same way. as we noted that is not correct as an independent matter of oregon law," and so on. that is not a totally unambiguous statement. i will concede that, but isn't the most obvious reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can punish for harm to others, so long as those others are oregonians and not people in other states?
how do they know that?
two  i have two things to say about that. one is it creates a problem with artuz because that type of rule  assuming the exceptions are like the pcra exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a claim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly that artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it was a properly filed application, not to whether it was an application with properly filed claims. the second point is that  is that for mr. pace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going forward, it  it can't be used against mr. pace because there was no such requirement in pennsylvania. i mean, presumably the  i assume the federal courts are not going to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to the state courts to say what their filing 
 we've got to take that as a given. i mean 
well, do you think the patton argument has anything to do with the evidence? i mean, the patton argument  correct me if i'm wrong, but i thought the argument that referred to general patton was an argument that, number one, talked about his addressing the troops before battle. and he was telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes their duty to kill. and he said: go out there and do your duty, which i assume any reasonable listener would say, go out there and kill. if a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an argument based upon the situation, the situation of the jurors vis a vis a capital defendant. and i would suppose that the reasonable inference from the argument is that they have a duty to go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty. that does not sound to me like an argument based upon the evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this case. now, am i wrong?
yes.
may i answer the question? no, your honor. i think the agency's conclusion was congress had not authorized it to undertake the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change and that, even if it had, that authority should not be exercised. thank you very much.
well, i can understand how you should be free to argue that in fact the two rules are not congruent, that there's broader recovery under the federal system. but if we decided that the two  if we agreed with them that they were congruent, then why should not issue preclusion apply?
right. if the  if the  if those  if the delivery drivers were workers  were employees, there's no question there were 15 employees. so the question was whether some workers count as employees and whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor is  is a longstanding question for a jury when there's a disputed issue of  of fact. and then the third consequence  i mean, here, there  the jury rendered a verdict on the state law claims, found in favor of respondent on one, petitioner on the other. and it seems highly unlikely that congress would think that that jury verdict should be vacated and the case retried in state court because the defendant has 14 instead of 15 employees.
yes.
 don't put in the qualifications.
what about the argument, though, that when you're talking about a threshold question like coverage, who the statute covers, and it's quite different from the cause of action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?
all right. and now i see  now i see, justice breyer, i did misunderstand  misunderstand the facts. those facts clearly are covered. they're  they're covered under 
because, to be blunt, the icj decision is wrong. this court gives respectful consideration to the decisions of the icj and other international tribunals, but it's certainly not bound by those decisions. this court should look carefully to the text of the treaty itself, to the ratification history, to the consistent interpretation of the executive branch, and to implementing practice in other states. at best, they  petitioners and their amici have suggested that there's some ambiguity in  in two states, australia and great britain. there are more than 160 contracting states to this  to this treaty.
statutes that  that say what?
well, you'll see in perhaps a dozen situations, he says, i simply don't believe that witness, none of whom he heard. and this is a case where credibility was key. was there a bribery scheme of the kind that the irs claimed? every witness who testified said no, it didn't exist. these are simple investments with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, the government's theory was there is some nefarious bribery scheme that every witness denied. and there is no documentary evidence of that. the evidence of the proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the result of their investing money in real estate deals. and so credibility was the key to this whole case. and the  the government, i don't think, can be serious when it tells this court that this first report is some confidential document, that it's privileged internal deliberative material. for 40 years, the  the tax court made these reports available to the public. it  they were routinely served on the parties. for 40 years there was no suggestion 
yes.
because if they're 
9.94a.125.
i think section 706(a) is fairly read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the two statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise of inherent authority. but the 706(b) and (c) just explain that the court may do something or the court may not, or the court shall do something. so we think our position  section 706(a) isn't even addressed to the court at all. it just gives the debtor the right to convert, and it doesn't purport to limit or speak to the situation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith or has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process. and i'd just like to end by saying that a debtor's bad faith concealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial affairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in a chapter 7 case. it threatens the very structural foundation of the code and its integrity.
it's a minor variation in the sense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate liability. that is, if we had proved that the pondcrete leaked hazardous substances into the environment and that rockwell knew that it was having that effect and that it nevertheless represented to the government it was in compliance, that would be enough to establish the knowing submission of a false claim even if we had no idea what was the reason for the pondcrete failure. and even if rockwell had taken the most herculean measures to produce good pondcrete and had not departed from standards of care in any respect, if nevertheless they knew that the pondcrete was in fact failing despite their best efforts and they represented that it was succeeding, they would be liable under the false claims act.
you can.
no, justice scalia, it's not. but i think what this court very clearly did in mcconnell is it rejected an argument that said that the only thing that congress could regulate is that which was unambiguously targeted at candidate elections.
did scott, know that? did scott  do you have evidence to show that scott knew that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?
justice ginsburg, without making any representations that i am going to canvas the universe on this, i have not seen a case where the district court has rejected a trial in that respect. and i think, your honor, this gives me an opportunity to talk about one of the fundamental problems 
well, your honor, this is primarily a case about the clean water act. i would point to the rapanos case, immediately before. the corps' name is not on the brief, and epa's name is not on the brief.
yes. there was a wickman case that  that was several years ago that is still good in the fifth, and our circuit adopted that when they put in the new circuit. what we're asking here today is basically a very narrow holding. we're asking that there be limited sovereign immunity  there  excuse me  that there be  in unique circumstances where core functions of the state are delegated to the county, that the county would have sovereign immunity, and that a state can cloak a county with sovereign immunity. it seems that that is an issue that the state ought to be able to do out of its delegation  out of its dignity function. they ought to have the right to run the state and  and delegate those functions as they see fit.
exactly. but you know, how you play the game depends upon at what level of generality you describe the right. and i agree with you if you describe the right as the right to cross-examination, that  that was  reinstituted by crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a right to confrontation  to cross-examination, which didn't exist before. i mean, you could dispense with that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of reliability.
yes. but again, first of all, i don't think the statistics would show that. i don't think logically they would show that in light of the numbers that are shown for completed burglary. but again, i don't see  with respect to the offenses that are covered that are at the core of the statute, i don't see why you would distinguish between the person who tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen event. they have created the same set of risks, they've triggered the same set of risks that the successful burglar has.
you're talking about civil only.
yes, your honor, in terms of section 760 the state of washington does think that's fine because of the purpose of the statute and the purpose of section 760, the purpose being to protect the integrity of the elections by several different means involving protecting 
absolutely. those are customizable plans. any person can go into 
no, your honor. in this instance, this document involves top level geico executives. and with respect to the advice of counsel issue, frankly it's a red herring. we have never asked to compel the defendants in either of these cases or any of the cases we're involved in, to waive their privilege. they've got the right, of course, to offer advice of counsel as an affirmative  as a defense in this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove our case to even reach what the counsel said. we believe we can prove our case based on the documents and subjective intent alone.
let me ask you this. you, of course, would object to having to show prejudice in any individual case. then it seems to me, to follow, that that's prejudice  that that means because prejudice is difficult to show. and if prejudice is judicial  difficult to show, why should we rule for you anyway?
right. but you were saying that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the status of an agreement that they might have entered into after one party had brought suit against the other. and 
so you can amend  you can amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend your claims.
and 
it seems to me you shouldn't  you shouldn't assume that  that the fact that this is a canine makes no difference.
no. his  the point of the trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the sentencing itself because the court has discretion before sentencing to let him out of his plea. after sentencing, he has to show that the plea was invalid. so his time  he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was concerned about consecutive as against concurrent sentences. in  in summary, the  the michigan system  the  with the limited date to the review and the kinds of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue are not  are lesser liberty interest questions because they have to do with amount of punishment. the michigan system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to have a factual record from which to advance his claims. he's not left to shift for himself, that there is a counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims 
i don't. i think 
well, the twenty-first amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.
justice ginsburg, i think the court has before it three options for some standard that would not consist of an automatic reversal standard. the first, and the government's preferred position, is that the defendant should come in and show what counsel of first choice would have done as a matter of strategy and show that if he had pursued that, it would create a reasonable probability of a different outcome, the same test as in strickland.
electric. i mean, it's not like 
actually we don't believe that's correct, your honor. we believe that 
 that's what good faith means in trademark law, generally. it has an established component.
yes, and that is  is the primary purpose of the policy overall, and 
you're absolutely right, your honor. that is absolutely clear. and  and again, i would think he would not have an interest in  in saying that a contract for murder is perfectly valid. you're absolutely right. it wouldn't get him more money in his pocket and it certainly would, i think, lead to the reputation of a rogue arbitrator out there who is not to be trusted. and  and presumably that person wouldn't  wouldn't get much business. again, so i think that the key point here is that the respondents have tried to create a lot of state law issues regarding void, voidable. and  and i think as justice ginsburg pointed out, the problem is it's kind of like trying to put a square peg in a round hole, that whether something is void or voidable under state law, which may vary from state to state, kind of misses the whole point which is the genius of a federal separability rule is we don't care about those state law issues. you don't have to get into that bog to decide the arbitrability question or the  you know, you cannot avoid arbitration by simply coming up with all those grounds. and whether it's ground a for challenging the underlying contract and whatever the severability implications may be of ground a or ground b, the point is when you're not challenging the arbitration clause, it's fair game to send you to arbitration, and then you can raise ground a or ground b or whatever ground you have before the arbitrator. and it's simply not a basis for avoiding arbitration altogether to be talking about that. and again, the  the point  i think this is all kind of a common-sensical point that you want to get parties quickly to arbitration. i mean, if you  if you have a situation where the parties have to spend years in court litigating these kind of issues, that really, in and of itself, defeats the whole point of  of arbitration.
well 
yes.
well, we don't know  we don't know if that's the case. he  he wants to go immediately to the court of appeals. what would the government's position be?
it's worse.
no. well, the  the merits of the case are going to be decided by the state court. the question of whether there's a federal defense based on slusa in the first instance is decided by the district court in remanding the case, and then if there becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-raise their slusa preemption argument, they are certainly free to do that.
no, justice kennedy, and  and to the contrary. in fiscal year 1994, the indian health service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. they told the general accounting office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the gao report cited in the government's brief. but 
i'm losing you. what's the second point that they're trying to make besides the fact that this didn't conform to brooke group?
they  they might not have thought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled to  to great weight. i mean, we don't know how they evaluated the aggravating circumstances.
yes, your honor. and 
if there are no more questions, i would just ask that the court reverse in this case. if there are any mootness concerns about mr. benitez, i would refer the court to friends of the environment which said that when a challenged practice has stopped voluntarily, that does not moot a case out in the supreme court unless there's some reason to believe they won't go at it again. and the government has asserted that it can revoke his release at any time for any reason and detain him indefinitely. and the suggestion that the fact that he's been released under the cuban review panel shows that his  he's been protected is  is not well taken. he was determined, when he first was detained in  in 2001, that he was eligible under the cuban review panel to be released. it took 3 years and the week before this case was argued in the highest court of the land before the immigration service did what its own regulations told it it had to do. thank you very much.
and you don't think there would be any conflict with the ferc scheme if you did that? you don't think there would be any conflict between the federal policy embodied in the power act and in the state law?
but 
yes.
there  there's no doubt that the court  or at least in my mind, that  that the trial court could have come out the other way. i  i  you know, all of the things you say are quite true. the question is whether the trial court had to come out the other way, whether it was just utterly unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it did. and that  you know, that's a  that's a heavy burden. and  and it is a messy transcript and all of that, but i  i find it difficult to see how  how you can establish that  not only that  that the trial court could have come out the other way or, indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment, should have come out the other way. but you have to establish that it's unreasonable not to come out the other way. and  and i find it hard to  to see how you can do that when you have a transcript that relies, in part, upon the  you know, the rolling of the eyes and the  and the trial court says, i'm  i'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that that's the reason she did it.
yes, your honor. in  in purkett and in  i don't know whether it was hernandez  i may have misheard you  the court reiterated the three-step process. all of those cases, however, rely on the existence of a step one with a shifting burden of production before reasons must be given and they must be given when step one is met. the objecting party must make a prima facie case. that does not happen until he has shown that it is more likely than not that there is discrimination.
well, your honor, the  the fact here is that the only reason they decided to change was for partisanship. that's what the district court found as a matter of fact. now, the other legal requirements of  of the map that are  give you the  the legitimate bases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the decade were already satisfied because such a map already existed. and as this court said in  in growe, the  the court-drawn map, in some sense, changes the status quo. you have to say what are the additional governmental interests that are  that exist and justify going through this process again and changing that map, which already is fully lawful, has been affirmed by this  this court as lawful.
yes.
i think our 
well, we think 
mr. salmons, there's one difference, a marked difference, between this statute and the others, and that is, in  in many of these cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. there's not a case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is in the front line. even in this very case, wasn't it true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the parent and there was no lawyer on the scene?
so that's, that's also a difference.
or the more restrictive.
well, justice souter, there are several responses. one is that the constitution puts a particular premium on avoiding express racial classifications.
i don't know that we would, justice souter. official
you 
thank you.
and what they're deciding is that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh it.
i'll do my best.
do you take into account that this was not something that occurred at once? this was a long-term relationship. there were many opportunities in which she might have, when her children were with the grandmother, say, gone to the police.
no. hood said 
no. i  i think  i think that the  the question of how government behaves, for purposes of its discharge of public responsibilities, you know, is treated through a lens that goes to whether or not the law can be properly vindicated there. and i assume that the state of new york has various laws that can be enforced in a way 
if congress wanted that, surely it could have stated it more clearly than simply saying the state shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging. a tort suit because of  of mislabeling is not a requirement for labeling or packaging.
well, we could look at hawaii. in hawaii they use the word assessed value. they couldn't possibly have wanted it to be market value, i wouldn't think.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the vienna convention does not create judicially enforceable individual rights. nevertheless, if this court were to hold that it does create individual rights, those treaty claims should not be treated more favorably than constitutional claims. in virginia, if a criminal defendant has a miranda claim or a fourth amendment claim and fails to raise it at trial, he may not raise it on collateral review. the same reasoning should apply with respect to any violation of the vienna convention. there's no reason to elevate a treaty claim above a miranda claim or a fourth amendment claim.
if you disagree with that, then they would have to be the same, and that's why our point about the existence of the parallel requirements is the same. i want to address the point of the discordance between what state juries can decide and what state regulators can decide because dow and the government have featured that in their case. the government in the medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one federal standard. the federal standard here is clear: falsity. tell the truth. that's what manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and under the regulations.
that's what it says. and then it says an increase is  and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing. how did you get  in your example, there was no increase. i mean, in a charge. in your salary, it's a decrease in the salary. same thing.
prima facie violation.
yes. all you have 
well, one explicit example is i think the state would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay. and the court  to  to move out a bit, the 
why is 
yes.
i'm asking what your recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.
well, it  but  but that is not what the rule says. number one, as  as your brother on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some determination made as a threshold matter as to whether this is even a religious claim or  or whether it's just gaming the system. so there's nothing automatic. number two, if there are, as  as there frequently will be, in the prison context important governmental interests which can only be served by denying the  the request, the request can be denied. and it seems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions of the  of the prison context, then i don't know what kind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except to say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise, it is establishment.
so it  it was true that this was  was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to make it unnecessary to use a  a peremptory challenge.
he sees someone that he knows is a parolee. is there any instruction that he's been given so that his discretion can be guided instead of rudderless? in practice in california, are all 
not just an 
they're not incorporated under the laws of any state, but they're incorporated under  under the national bank act. they're federally chartered corporations like other federally chartered corporations. and so in that sense, we think it makes sense to apply the normal rules that apply to corporate citizenship to national banks.
it  it does  to the extent that strawbridge is involved, it  it is 
now, if, in fact, he's being disciplined for that, the other side is telling you he has a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies. go to the bar associations. many states have laws, the statutes that protect people under these situations. and why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get the same relief which will short circuit all the other remedies? and if you do, there are going to be thousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll all run to  to the constitutional court. all right. so, now, what's your reply?
well, yellowstone was created before the state of wyoming and 
but 
suppose i send someone to the patent office, goes there, picks up the patent, and this patent is written very, very, very concretely and specifically. gets on the phone, phones somebody in germany and reads it to him. and that person, having an excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the precise instruction necessary to change the machine around or put various things into it. so now it is a precise copy of the machine in the united states.
well, do you concede that even though he had been convicted, it would, nevertheless, be prejudicial in the eyes of the jury to see a man shackled when one of the issues they'll have to decide is whether his future dangerousness might  might justify his execution? do you think there is prejudice there, or do you share justice scalia's view that it would be a good thing for the defendant?
i don't think, when congress enacted section 1448, that they even knew about branch banking. the  the  that  that is something that has evolved really since 1994 when the neal-riegle act was enacted. so the statute says 
if only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline. i mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases or the milk processing cases. how do we decide whether this is one of the traditional governmental services, the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these that looks more like regular market participation?
is there any other  i mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which i've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious. is there any other difference, in your opinion?
 i'm not 
but he certainly committed a lot of 
justice scalia [sic] 
let me try to hit a couple of highlights. this is much more of a call for military commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of military commissions against the medoc indians or any number of other instances in which the president has availed himself of this authority in the past. i think the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war where the laws of war are involved. as to whether or not the law of war encompasses the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we think that is clearly established. that is something that the united states treated as a valid war crime in the civil war. that is something that the united states treated as a valid war crime in world war ii. i would invite you, as to the former, to look at winthrop's treatise, page 839, note 5. he makes it very clear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of municipal law, what he called "of the first class," but they included the second class, which are classic war crimes. the most prominent examples are the lincoln conspirators and a conspiracy at andersonville prison to deny pows their lawful rights. clearly, those are classic war crimes. in world war ii, of course, conspiracy was also charged. and this court saw it in the kearing case, although it didn't reach that element of the charge. now, i think it's very important to understand that history, because the most relevant text on this question is article 21's reference to the law of war. and as this court was crystal clear in the madsen case, what that reference is, is congress's effort, when it extended the jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the military jurisdiction of the military commissions just because they had concurrent jurisdiction. and this court, in madsen, said what congress authorized was the jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in 1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21 of the ucmj, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950. well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the law of war. in 1950, you could violate conspiracies to the law of war. so, now let me try to get to the procedures that would be applicable. the argument that's made here is an extraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that military commissions can deviate from the laws of evidence, to the extent the president determines necessary, except that it must apply for the  comply with the provisions of the ucmj. clearly, what that provision means is the provisions of the ucmj that specifically impose requirements on the military commissions. and there are nine of them. and they impose some  certain minimum rules. but to say that that provision incorporates all of the ucmj provisions that put much higher requirements on courts-martials, is to violate this court's madsen decision, which clearly recognized that there were differences between court-martials and military commissions. and, although that was an act  that was a case that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is identical to article 36(a) of the ucmj, so that's not a difference that matters. and, if i could say, the other thing is, that just violates any normal principle of statutory construction, because then the nine express references to the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous. clearly, what congress had in mind was that, "you must comply with those provisions of the ucmj that apply specifically to the military commissions." if i could make this point clear, because i think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made yamashita and other of the world war ii cases so difficult is that the president in that situation constituted commissions that violated even the procedural rules that the articles of war made specifically applicable to the commissions. and so, if you look, for example, at justice rutledge's dissent in the yamashita case, he was at pains to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the articles of war applied to military commissions. and the difficulty was that the  that the military, in that case, was not complying with even those provisions that specifically applied to military commissions by terms. that's not an issue here. these military commissions comply with all of the provisions of the ucmj that are specifically addressed to military commissions. so, i just don't think there's a procedural problem here. the import of extending article 2 jurisdiction to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in yamashita, as to this point, is really no  is still relevant. what that does is, it takes away the argument  to the extent that these individuals are within article 2, it takes away the argument that the president doesn't have to even comply with those provisions of the ucmj that are expressly directed to the military commissions. but that's not an argument we're making here. the argument on the other side of this is really that when congress specifies that nine rules apply to military commissions, and everything else applies to courts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to the military commissions. and as justice scalia's question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that argument, you really have to believe that what congress was doing when it was carefully preserving the military  the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to preserve the option of calling something that had to comply with every single statutory requirement in the court-martials. they got to label it something else. they got to label it a "military commission." clearly, if you look at the legislative history of article of war 15 and article 21, as they were developed in the madsen decision and discussed in the authoritative testimony of general crowder, that's exactly what wasn't going on. they wanted to make sure that this argument, that as we get more and more things that come within the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials, that somehow we're cutting back on the military commissions. that's not what they wanted. the next thing that may be lurking in the question is the question of, wwat about the geneva conventions? and i think that, very importantly, we have arguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the geneva conventions do not provide relief in these circumstances, that they do not apply, for various reasons. but the first question, at the outset, is whether this court is going to overrule that portion of eisentrager that basically said the geneva conventions are not judicially enforceable. now, of course, this court can say, "that was the '29 convention, and this is the 1949 convention." but, as the court of appeals correctly determined 
well, mr. chief justice, i don't think that the law in this area is founded on a notion of agency. it's founded on a notion of independent authority of each to grant access to the police, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect to premises over which authority is shared. and in a case like this, the wife has an independent interest in disassociating herself from criminal activity that is going on, on the premises.
no, your honor.
it's  you meant the things on both sides of the or.
but that 
but you still have the option, and i'm just dying to ask the question not having anything to do with the case. why did they do this? why did they have  was it just to make everybody feel good and they think they're ripping off the government because they're getting only a 35 percent value, even though everybody knows they'll just raise the rate if it changes?
yes, your honor.
there is no way that you can lump in the other three schools. with respect to vmi, by filing a proof of claim, vmi exposed itself to the trustee's defenses. to the extent that the setoff is a defense for the trustee, then, of course, that setoff would apply to vmi. before i sit down, i'd like to make three points. first, seminole tribe controls. congress may not use its article 1 bankruptcy clause to abrogate sovereign immunity. second, to rule in favor of virginia does not require any alterations in this court's jurisprudence; however, to rule for mr. katz on any theory requires certain fundamental changes in this court's jurisprudence. finally, regardless of context, sovereign immunity bars monetary judgment claims. states are immune from contract actions; private parties are not. states are immune from court actions; private parties are not. states are immune from actions by the trustee to augment the estate; private parties are not. thank you.
yes, justice o'connor, they specifically held that all of the waiting time is not  it is to be excluded. and they did that on the basis of 790.7(g), before you get to the footnote  because that's the tag to the footnote  as to what is  what is the ordinary meaning of wait  of preliminary and postliminary for waiting time? and the expectation is that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're waiting to check in, the recognition is that those  those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here. there's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you will end up spending time waiting. indeed, the scheme is designed to get people in as efficiently 
well, your honor, as people in the office are familiar with, in the sg's office, the names in the brief tell very little about who has participated in the discussions and the writing of the brief. the rapanos case 
correct, your honor.
no, but if  as i understand it, it has construed it by saying that if you go above the middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as a matter of law. and that unreasonableness as a matter of law feature is what distinguishes it from the federal system post booker.
well, i think what your honor is really asking is, if the plaintiff in this case had taken his disposition memorandum, and, rather than give it to his supervisor, which what he  what he was required to do, he went to the public and gave it to them on a pending case, i don't necessarily think that would be protected under pickering, as well.
 an exception 
may i ask you this? there are two questions just generally. one, i'm curious about the answer to my question to  to mr. waxman. did the minimum punishment ploy ever work? did it ever succeed in getting a challenge for cause granted?
is  is step one of title vii more likely than not?
but that's why i'm quite curious, but i only have experience in one circuit. and  and i have an impression, but i need to know what is the general practice. i would have thought  but this is highly impressionistic  that probably the mandates didn't always issue within 7 days, that it wasn't totally uncommon to have them 10 days or 12, and it was fairly informal. certainly there were no notice, but maybe other circuits do it differently. it's an area that's obscure to me, and i'd like to know how do people actually handle it. is it something that is generally within the  up to the individual court of appeals to provide notice or not or whatever as it wishes? is it that some delays, 6 months, might be really much too late? is it  how does it work in the circuits?
 development.
well, it's 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: justice o'connor, when you mentioned that this is a waiver of sovereign immunity and we have to construe that with that in mind, it's, sort of, central to our starting to our point for understanding this statute. this claim falls squarely within the text of the statutory exception, and there doesn't seem to be much dispute about that. and the question is whether 
what  what do you say about expenses? isn't  isn't it a fairly common practice for a  a trial lawyer to  to hire his experts and pay them and then bill the client for  for whatever he's paid for the experts? i mean, if that is the  this has been a long time since i've practiced law. so maybe that isn't the way it's done anymore. but it  it certainly has been done that way, and  and if that is still the practice, wouldn't it make sense for congress to have assumed that expenses would include those kinds of expenses?
it's the criminal trial.
what process do you think your client was entitled to?
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: mario  mario bustillo was not advised of his rights under article 36 in direct contravention of the treaty. as a result, he went to trial for first-degree murder, having had no contact with a consular officer from his home country and being completely unaware that he was entitled to do so. the virginia courts improperly relied upon the result of that violation, itself the product of failure to comply with the treaty, to refuse to consider critical exculpatory evidence that was uniquely in the possession and available with the assistance of the consular officers. that evidence would have included official government immigration records, corroborating a key defense witness, and proving that the alternative suspect, a honduran national, known as sirena, fled to honduras the day after the victim died. the honduran consulate also would have provided sirena's address and attempted to interview him. indeed, once bustillo's habeas counsel located sirena in honduras, he obtained a surreptitiously videotaped confession in which sirena admitted, in chilling detail, to committing the crime and acknowledged that mario bustillo had been wrongly convicted.
and there are two reasons why he didn't want to go get a warrant. it would take about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep. and in addition to that, the underage drinking will continue for another half an hour or an hour. and in addition to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose. so those are the reasons why  or worse. so those are the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.
how does it 
790.7(g), footnote 49, and it says, as 
that was in excess of the court's authority under the rules.
you said that 
but why should it be, why should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind of waiver than a guilty plea itself? now i admit there's no authority on the point. but isn't it absolutely obvious?
well, can't you under  look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in that transcript. imagine that's the circumstance. if that's the circumstance, then i should think there is no doubt, under oregon law, that those words in the transcript are admissible. and i believe that under oregon law  and i'm not certain  that, an ordinary case, a death-eligible person does have the right to argue in the sentencing proceeding. think back over that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts as to whether this man is guilty or not. am i right  am i right on the first part? am i right on the second part?
"information service"  i apologize  is at 1a. the term "information service" means "the offering of a capability for (inaudible) via telecommunications." they're categorizing this thing as an information service, so they have to be acknowledging there's telecommunications involved. so, obviously, cable modem service 
but what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong? i mean, you get into a fight with your neighbor. it's got nothing to do with your employment at all but the attorney general certifies that it does. you know: "they are always thinking about your cases. you must have been thinking about it at the time." that certification goes into the district court. the district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, throws it out, then that state law assault case proceeds in federal court?
unless made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the constitution.
let me 
i just wanted to ask one. i don't remember whether the briefs discuss it or not, but is there a statute that prohibits the disclosure of secret agents like this and does that  if so, does that have any relevance to this case?
justice scalia, if you actually believe that, then you just don't believe the judges in the federal circuit because in each of these opinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing it.
but don't we  don't we have the same problem if we're  if we're dealing with first amendment interests that we do when we're dealing with eighth amendment interests? in other words, if  if we don't say, well, they get outside of turner analysis because they require  by virtue of being enumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to them, is the abridgement of the right carried so far that it is unreasonable? if we don't say that, then i don't see, as your friends on the other side have argued, i don't see where the logical stopping point is if we accept the  the behavior modification theory.
then you have to explain what happened in the arctic coast case, why we were able to retain the anwr lands which did not fall within the main provision. and that is because congress was making  because this court concluded that congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred. and even a provision that could be misconstrued, as i'm afraid this court did in  in arctic coast  could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands, we need to make adequate assurance that  that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made. we are retaining these wildlife lands. that's 
but it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. i mean, in these other  in these other cases, congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in wickard v. filburn. congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. and it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. i mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?
there's nothing in the record, your honor. the policy has been in effect for a considerable length of time, and  and during that time, they have not interracially housed inmates in the same cell. i think it's important to remember here that the policy only applies in the reception center areas and in the cells.
and that's why simply charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the statute under a taylor analysis as you understand it.
would you help me with one thing i'm not terribly clear about, though. is it clear which  what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion?
what goes with the taxes? you've said that the other effect will be that whenever the oneidas buy a piece of property that is within this former reservation, and of which only 1 percent is now owned by indians, whenever they buy a piece of property, that property is taken off the tax rolls.
"required" is  sometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's not a wait. is that required?
that's a good point, your honor. i don't think this court needs to circumscribe the judge's authority to suggest an amendment. i think you could wrap it all into the ruling and evaluate that for abuse of discretion.
no, your honor. that is  with all 23 due respect, that is too constricted a view of what 
and the federal circuit said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious.
that is exactly 
i don't agree it does no good at all. i 
 from this immediate  -
well, normally we would think the trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by counsel. we would normally think that, wouldn't we?
 put on the live testimony of the  of the 
and i don't  i didn't understand it to set up parallel systems of factual determinations.
that's correct.
 is involved.
i think that would depend on the fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.
 as possible.
that would, that would create an issue? you know, what if they say: nothing? maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with that. but does that raise a constitutional problem that in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the dissenting workers?
he had that already.
that is, at the time of the state court decision. *end steno
well, i agree, justice breyer. and i misspoke, i used one word incorrectly. i said  i should have said this court has not held. i agree with general clement that swann was dictum, but a very strong dictum. and we do think it applies here. dictum.
what if  what if wesley comes in with a  with a motion to vacate now and  and he points to the inconsistency with the  with the stumpf trial? would he also be entitled to get his sentence vacated because of the same inconsistency that you're pointing out?
well, my question is, if we hold for you here, and we don't take an absolute principle, well, i guess states are forbidden to put any upstream taxes on.
it's agent bigbee. i'm getting confused.
yes.
the court took care to point out why those were not realistic remedies. but here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.
but justice stevens's question was that the allegation was that after that date they agreed not to compete. that states  that states a cause of action under the sherman act, doesn't it?
as long as they are consistent?
but it's 
presumably you could and if there's someone who wants to do that, which is going to be a rare 
that's the direct language?
yes, but why 
your honor, the initial matters you discussed  sent to the back of the room  the idea is not implicated there. if the school system tries to change the child's placement, then this court has already said that the school system bears 
well, my slight modification of justice scalia's hypothetical  and it proceeds on the same theory  is suppose there's a huge demand for housing. a developer has a plan to build 500 units. can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on the ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the houses go to minorities? that means people will live together. then we can have a school, a school that can be diverse.
well, but you're just hiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't in retaliation. your assertion still puts them in the position of having to defend a constitutional claim on a case-by-case basis every time there's a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior about, as in this case, what brady requires.
i think you're wrong, your honor. he actually in his complaint asked for economic damages. he doesn't specify them, but in an affidavit that he submitted to the district court, he said that his net worth had declined 8 million dollars and he is saying that he 
okay.
which is what  is  how does that differ from what happened here?
what would happen  i think one of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi-defendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution case is done, defendant a, i'm going to grant a motion to acquit. he's out of it, but there was enough evidence to require the  the defense to go on for b and c. and then after hearing b and c's defense, the judge said, i think i was wrong about acquitting a, so i'm  i'm going to withdraw it. would there be  could that be done without any  any double jeopardy bar? the jury hasn't been discharged.
what's going on? i mean, it's very confusing.
you know, it's  it's very possible that the scrubbing will be regarded as an integral and indispensable part of the  of the  of the employment, and 
do you agree with the court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue here?
well, it isn't just duration of  of confinement. i mean, in  in balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the  the good time scheme. the  the gut notion behind balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. we don't have that here. what we have here is a scheme that makes a  a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence. we know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered. and however that may be classified, it's not simply a balisok situation.
i thought munsingwear was about mootness.
and that's  that's quite separate from 
what preclusion law do you apply? the ninth circuit apparently applied oregon preclusion law.
 have not, but it's possible for, it seems to me  for all we know, it's possible that oregon could say, "look, we have a statute that says everything that was introduced at trial may be considered. that may be a good thing or a bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they may consider it. but when the question comes, what new evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing  the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict that only to evidence which, in our view, is required by the eighth amendment." so, if that is, then  we don't  i don't know whether the oregon supreme court took that view, or not. but if it did take that view, and, in this case, the respondents say, "we no longer want to introduce any new evidence," then we would not have a case left, it seems to me.
 some other way you could stay. what's the other way?
okay. i got the idea. if he does  if i do, it's not. what about i have a coffee  coffee. i wanted to get the line. i see it. coffee. i want to have coffee and donuts, free donuts because  and coffee for people to come in. is that counted or not?
that is exactly right. what they could have done in response to our motion for summary judgment is to say this product assertedly harms  when it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the product it is  the plant that it's supposed to protect if the soil ph is too high. they could have easily have come back and said if they had a  a design defect claim that didn't impeach the label to say you should have  there was a way to manufacture this product. you could have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more acidic solution. the classic case, which is referenced in the nrdc brief, which has many, many examples of true design defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case involving rat poison. it's a case called banks v. ici america. it's a georgia supreme court 
justice kennedy, i frankly didn't read it that way. it just seemed to be he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation to report. clearly, it has some impact on how people feel about the judicial system and the particular lawyer's reputation if the judge were to affirm the motion. but i  i would expect the judge was doing his job and performing his duties correctly.
if the state is 
i read the term as, as one of the justices here does, not referring to the rate. the earlier part refers to the rate. an increase in any charge for, that's the rate. and then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage. i mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for 
yes, but i think that's one reason that congress does not ordinarily make jurisdiction turn on those types of facts. in the admiralty concept  context that you recognized, it's necessary to distinguish between admiralty jurisdiction and general federal question jurisdiction. so congress had to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was by saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a vessel in navigable waters or elsewhere. but ordinarily when  a distinction does not have to be drawn like that. in section 1343, it was the same because congress didn't want that to be conflated with section 1331 at the time. when jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual factors, congress ordinarily just lets the broad jurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear, simple threshold inquiry so parties can determine they're in the right court, and then the case can be proceeded  can be litigated on the merits from there. justice kennedy asked whether a court could raise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a merits issue. and i think the answer is that although the defendant waived the issue here and therefore has no right to insist that it be raised, most waiver doctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts retain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in some circumstances. that discretion would be greater at the outset of a case where a federal court decided it should not be deciding a case than it would be once a jury had already decided the case, which is what happened here. finally, respondent relies on a number of this court's title vii decisions for the proposition that this requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction. the basic point is that this court has never opined in dicta or in holding on whether this requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction of the courts. this court's only title vii subject matter jurisdiction case is zipes which held that a requirement was not jurisdictional because it was not  did not textually modify title vii's broad jurisdictional provision and in light of other relevant canons of construction. and for precisely the same reasons, the definition of employer does not textually modify the definitional provision and therefore it does not limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim either up or down based on its merits. if the court has no further questions, i have nothing further.
thank you. the case is submitted.
well, first of all, again, justice ginsburg, the privacy act issue is not one that we have raised before this court. but  but the reason that i would suggest it is distinguishable is that in a subsequent case considered by the washington state supreme court called state v. clark, the court look at flora, the intermediate appellate court case, and  and termed it as a case that said you do not have a private conversation when it is open to passers-by. and in flora, there was another individual present at the scene and who was, in fact, subsequently arrested for interfering with the arrest in the flora case. so there is, all i'm suggesting, at least some grounds for distinguishing the flora case for that reason.
i think there is this debate 
the  the only that's special to 10 pennsylvania is what pennsylvania law tells you you're 11 going to find in those files. that makes it different 12 than, say, georgia where there's no provision for having 13 that material in those files.
is that the application of the nonintercourse act? i assume it applied only to federal act reservations.
in a single-count case, your honor 
 the record is clear that the two taxes cannot coexist in the long run, because it would price the 
justice scalia, the purpose of the statute is to obtain for the child an individualized education program.
yes, sir.
i suppose you could say that a  the intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too, right? it's 
he knows it, but his present decision is necessarily based on some prior decision that was discriminatory.
there are not two writs of habeas corpus for some cases and for other cases. the rights that  the rights that may be asserted, the rights that may be vindicated, will vary with the circumstances, but jurisdiction over habeas corpus is jurisdiction over habeas corpus. and it seems to me that the position you have taken is that if, at the end of the day, we have to reach the question that justice breyer described, the answer to that question may be, "yes, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended by inadvertence. congress did not intend to do it." is that really your position?
yes.
it certainly has a hybrid quality, justice scalia. and it's not a hybrid quality that the industry particularly likes. but it is the first time that the government asserts its state  its claims as to what's wrong, in a binding legally operative document, official where the failure to respond results in default. it has that function as complaint. it is the first salvo in official, formal administrative proceedings.
 have a 
 so forth. and 
i'm sorry. punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a  but it could be available against some other private recipients.
so, basically, your argument rests on the fact that we can draw a distinction between entry and manner of entry.
the  the autonomy interest in this case is the defendant's right to control his defense. it's the defendant's right, as this court put it in faretta and later in mckaskle, to control the way his case 
 and, therefore, that this testimony is irrelevant? is that the state's argument, as you understand it?
and let me explain. it's certainly true that lincoln identifies, at page 96 of the cert petition appendix, a chart of entities that are salient. the most notable omission from the chart is the relationship of any of those entities to lincoln. there is no evidence as to what  how attenuated that was or what the relationship is, what indemnities existed, or whether lincoln actually had an interest in this outcome. they now rely on an agency theory. that isn't how the case was defended.
the writ is the 
it is in the  in the joint appendix, the entire 
no, but you're saying, isn't your answer to justice stevens is that it was a rebuttable presumption?
i think there was a reference to my lady's bath in the opinion.
it deals with the military.
how would the court  a court go about monitoring this fair procedure 
the result is that's a question of causation, your honor, if there is evidence.
i thought wesley didn't receive a death sentence.
and  and you  you expect us 25 in all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and 1  and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his 2 depravity into he's future  you know, he's going to be 3 dangerous in the future?
sure.
two answers, justice ginsburg. first, this was the second time in 1986 that congress refused to include that limitation on courts. the prior law, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts of the united states, states, and territories. it did not pick up that language in title iv in 1968, and they took it out 
i'm not sure what the criteria are that i have to follow  that we have to follow in deciding the case. just count up all the cases and 
i think 
ms. zapp, i guess  i guess 1 i'm confused about your case. i had thought that you were 2 not arguing that simmons requires a talismanic word or 3 even that it requires much more than existed here. i 4 thought what you were arguing is simply that simmons could 5 at that time have been interpreted that way.
well, i think what it reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand of automatic reversal.
lorance?
is that your argument?
they do.
and 
yes, your honor. but what  in booker, what made the federal system constitutional was not the engraftment of the reasonableness review. it was rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory. and that's the aspect of california's supreme court black decision that they've misread the booker decision.
it just seems to  seem to me to be part of the question presented.
 why they did 
quite 
justice scalia, the probate exception protects the integrity of the succession process. if the documents you're looking at deal with the succession of the property, as the living trust and will do in this case, it is encompassed within the probate exception in the sutton case 
yes, of her detention. and that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.
well, that may be, but let me, again, if i  if i might, respond to that  to this  to this point, because i think it is true that the proportion of times under our argument that the 10-year bar would apply would  is greater under our position, but it is, nevertheless, true that heta still applies to many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar applies to somewhat more. but let me  i think there's another answer to your point, which is, it still does not undercut our basic submission that the congress could not have formed this specific intent. and it's very unlike the  the intent being to get to the government the  the result it seeks here. and the reason for that is  is, they could not have focused on this problem, because in  it wasn't for another 5 years that social security was even on the radar screen at all. and this brings me back, i think, to justice breyer's 
is there 
well, not advocating; reporting what the government position is. i mean, the  when the cigarette company says on the package, "the surgeon general has found this stuff is deadly," they're not quite saying, "we agree with the surgeon general." they've  making them fund or support statements that do not reflect their own beliefs, as though it were 
well, the states should enforce it generally by giving information to the detainee at the point in time when they realize  determine that he's a foreign national. the state department is engaged in extensive 
that's correct. and i think 
it may not be the exclusive test. we're  i'm asking what the test ought to be.
it seems to me that's all that's left out of it. now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?
well, first of all, the supreme judicial court of massachusetts is the one who promulgated the rules in this case. rule 25(a) is promulgated by the supreme judicial court of 
but this court has never held that a  it would be unfair to hold that an appeal of a sentence can be moot while that sentence is still in effect, and when it can still have consequences for mr. toledo-flores. and that's what distinguishes this case from all the other cases decided by this court, is that the sentence itself is the concrete and continuing injury that defeats 
we don't know. but in talking with the state liquor authority, they have made it clear that their intent would be to require that the liquor come first to the in-state premises 
no. that is something i disagree with. if the substance of the law 
but now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility. and wouldn't the bankruptcy court's findings in the later case have preclusive effect?
not to my 
 interests at 
correct.
and there could be 
because? what are the practicalities of that? why would it hurt the lawyers representing victims?
right.
mr. radmore, what was the purpose of the enactment of the waiver of federal sovereign immunity here? was it to allow recovery for auto accidents occurring by postal trucks?
where does this factor (k) come from? what was the source of it?
well, justice ginsburg, i think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of teachers that might be okay. if they're going to start assigning teachers to particular schools and have sort of racial quotas for the faculty at various schools, i think that crosses a line.
yes. yes, it is.
may i interrupt with this question? do you think all those steps were constitutionally mandated?
it would take a few years, your honor, but it is a basic premise of the clean air act that vehicle fleets regularly turn over 
 20 years, though.
we  we limit 
and that page 
your honor, we believe that under the  the section 7 of the michigan law, there is no fee charged for your ssrs.
well, for example, shapiro v. thompson. the court has said that the right to travel cannot be penalized. the broad point that 
justice breyer, the physician in those instances could perform the immediate abortion.
well, i think 
judicially it cannot be enforced.
well, clark, of course, is a federal question case. clark is a case at  at the time when there was an amount-in-controversy requirement.
yes. considered i agree. they certainly considered the evidence, but they also, if they were following their obligation under the law, they considered whether or not they were entitled to give that any weight under factor (k). that was the primary function that was given to them. so certainly they discussed the evidence, but then did they arrive  did they go in that room and arrive at a decision that maybe we can't by law consider this evidence? and i think that's the focal point here and that's the thing this court doesn't know what happened in that jury room.
justice scalia, i  i would certainly with respect to search of common areas. for example, this was a delivery to some sort of a 
it  it's not the  if you look at the statute  and let me just work my way through it with you. it's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. and the question is what does on account of modify there. i think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.
okay.
i didn't think you'd be willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates the commerce clause.
no, i'm not talking about negating the award. i'm  if that theory is sound, if the child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement, i presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed to go to the person who paid the money?
the statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for  in connection with underwriting.
well, he can't decide against the parent because the only issue at stake is the right of the child.
 knock it down if you can.
if you prevail, why can't every attorney who represents a creditor who has a credit card or a promissory note providing for attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?
do  do any of those cases that you allude to that have means in some sections, includes in others  do any of them have in third sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?
 i think you just 
that's pretty clear language.
if he knew right from wrong, if they  so, i mean, he  it's not his intellectual capacity that's wrong, it's his ability to control his impulse.
well, the claim was still  it was certainly not because of any kind of  of privity. it was damages based on 
but this  this is given  i mean, this is legirons. it's not leg braces. belly chain. you don't need to make a record to  to know that those things are visible. is there any serious doubt that they were visible?
i presume, from that, that congress had shifted its focus in the new statute to the purposes that we have articulated in the brief, one of them being 
 this question, to follow up on justice o'connor's thought. can  are you saying that the school can engage in speech expressing its views about the military policies, can it engage in symbolic speech by affording access, which is equal in all functional requirements, but yet sends a message that they are really disagreeing with what's going on by, say  let a law school say, "well, for  most employers will let you use the regular law-school placement facilities, but, for the military, we will require you use the college facilities to send a message that we disapprove, if the college facility is equally of  good, as a matter of functioning"?
and the rule seems to conflate  seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete fact. and it seems to me that we've got to consider the rule in responding to the ambiguity that justice breyer referred to a moment ago. the ambiguity has got to be read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the evidence. that means a fact finding.
what are you talking about when you say a horizontal agreement? are you talking about a group of underwriters in the context of a single ipo?
well, the  the 
that's right. and, in fact, there are some times when you can hear all three voices on the 911 tape, not in this instance. but as i said, almost immediately after the call began, she said, help is on the way, that's because you can dispatch but still obtain information, for example, the date of birth. and as mr. chief justice indicated, date of birth of the defendant and name, et cetera are extremely important so that in those 4 minutes that it  coincidentally, it was also 4 minutes before the police officer arrived  they can be determining whether or not the defendant has criminal history. they can determine whether or not, from their records available to them in their police car, whether or not the defendant has a history of assaults against police officers, whether or not he has a  a history of carrying weapons, et cetera. so that's all information that the operators are trained to  to obtain and then to transfer to the police as soon as possible.
i think there is something special about third party guilt. alibi is merely the defendant saying i didn't do it and i wasn't there when the crime was done. i think in third party guilt evidence you're diverting the case off in another direction that requires some special attention by the courts, and i think most states recognize it requires special attention by the court because it's hitting on a collateral issue requiring the state to prove or, to some extent, disprove that another individual did it, an individual that might not be subject to notice requirements, an individual that might not even be alive. we look at  you can look at the  this court's decision in donnelly v. the united states, a 1911 decision, that recognized there's something different about third party guilt potential evidence because of the inherent unreliability which may exist in the manner and the way it was presented.
it could cover, under your theory, this very act, just dumping the stuff there on the porch, if the consequence of that had not been that the homeowner tripped over it, but that rain destroyed the contents of the  of the letters so that they were illegible.
 no evidence 
no. it's a handwritten one that doesn't say anything 
 was not fully developed.
yes. if the court thinks the statute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the conference report.
now, we've slid back from the joint statement to the statement of one member on the floor now.
well, but that's the point here. he has not done that. he did not attempt to develop facts or he was not precluded from developing facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his ineffective assistance claim. if i could, your honor, there are two different parts of that question. first, the facts are not relevant. the facts that he's seeking to develop in an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this mitigation that should have been developed. if, in fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not relevant.
it's footnote 17.
i suppose your concession about the duty is based on chief justice stone's opinion in viereck, isn't it?
why is that the most reasonable presumption? why isn't the most reasonable presumption that the california court denies, for untimeliness, wherever that issue is absolutely clear  -
that's correct. unless you have  or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. there are several different reasons that you can  you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. however, the penalty is not  is not the deciding factor. it's their ability to access the funds at any time that  that makes that a right of payment. it's not a right of payment without a penalty. it's just that the right to payment exists at all times.
all 
i know you want to reserve your time. just one quick thing. the government makes the distinction between an action to remove a cloud on title and an action for possession. do you agree that this is a  a action to remove a cloud on title?
it does not apply because congress didn't express the intent.
you could house transferees only with other transferees, i assume.
that's 
because, your honor, in the first instance, number one, uniformity really is not a  a legitimate claim in this  in this instance by blue cross and blue shield.
no.
that's exactly right, your honor. that's exactly right.
let me say one word on jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the official merits. on jurisdiction, i think mr. roberts is right that this rarely happens in the federal system. it rarely happens in the state system. we can't find any other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the state would say, in effect the wrong judgment and saying: "i'm challenging this judgment." but what happened here was just that. mr. burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 judgment. and under this court's castro decision, when a pro se petitioner comes in and says i'm doing one thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it can't be converted into something else which is a first habeas petition without advising the petitioner. and here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but the state in its own answer, which we attached to our reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment. so it's way too late in the day for the state to stand up to you now and say this pro se petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an improper petition. on the merits, i don't want to elaborate beyond simply just telling this court that if you look at the hughes decision and you look at the washington official decision from the washington state courts, it is clear that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly too lenient factor. hughes makes it crystal clear that a judge needs to find, and i'm quoting, "extraordinarily serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple offenses." and to the extent that the state stands before you now and quotes from parts of mr. burton's case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas petition now, that under washington state law, the judge needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the judge didn't do so. let me finally turn to a discussion about whether this court's treatment of walton and apprendi could have given a state judge a reasonable basis to distinguish the system at issue in blakely. we don't think it could because this court didn't simply say in apprendi that walton stands. it explicitly said the reason why the arizona capital system as we understand it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system that is permissible under williams against new york. it's one where on the basis of the jury's finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible without anything else. and so the only disagreement official between the majority and justice o'connor's dissent was as to the way arizona's system worked, but any judge that would have looked at apprendi would have seen, the majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence. that is exactly the kind of system that was not in place in washington, so a judge should have full well realized. and of course as justice ginsburg pointed out, once it became clear to this court the way that arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this court had little difficulty simply applying the apprendi rule and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too. and just like the blakely decision itself, not even the dissenters suggested that apprendi dictated otherwise. if this court has no further questions, i'll submit the case.
no, but i think, justice ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered prior to 1974. there were certain 
and no money damages.
no. but there's no provision, is there, that says that the finding under (b)(4), that there has to even be a finding under (b)(4), much less when the finding has to be made?
you don't have any such problem here. there's no conflict between the new york law  you certainly could have gone into that lawsuit and 
 notes in there 
do we have to give  let me ask you this. and maybe this is the, as far as we can go with it here. is that the answer to the question here about what the statement means?
all right. but 
certainly.
but we 
right, because congress didn't say it. if congress had phrased this the way it phrased the  the 6(3) as a whole and said it shall it run from the later of three dates, the date that the supreme court holds it  recognizes the right or the date it holds it retroactive, that would have  that would have been 
yeah.
your honor, i think the numbers that you're reading are from the difference between the 2000 and  '99 and the 2000 enrollments.
it depends, justice kennedy. if state law, if it's an unsecured claim under section 501(b)(1) 
correct.
all right.
certainly extremely broad discretion.
but you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory  you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject  substance from being sold or  in interstate commerce. and if you just follow the litter  letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. in fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.
what you're going to hear in a second, i'm sure, because i read it in the briefs, my understanding of the texas point is slightly different. it is this. that under texas law, when you file before the, before the trial, a general objection, unless you make the objection again when the specific, when a specific instruction is given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal. under texas law. and they say that's true of evidence and that's true here, too. and they say that's just texas law, ordinary texas law. now 
don't they have to show that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?
well, one of the problems is i don't know what it requires. on  on the  on the second page of the opinion that i quoted, it is used with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in light of all the evidence. sometimes it is used without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion. i don't know what they mean by inference. do they mean evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from which one  there is a reasonable possibility of concluding? i just don't know what the terms mean. so i hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with  with terms that  that are defined that  that you and the states that you represent would  would think was an acceptable and constitutional standard.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court. crawford does not satisfy either of the two requirements for a retroactive watershed rule. the application of roberts rather than crawford did not so seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate convictions as to require the wholesale reopening of convictions that were final before crawford was decided, with all the societial costs that entails.
both are the texas case. both deal with mr. penry.
well, even if that were true, we would still, of course, be entitled to  i mean, it doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence. it doesn't say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect official to the  our clients 
right.
may i just ask this, just to clarify? when they do take away some jurisdiction of some habeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or do you say it is not a suspension of the writ?
and  and that evidence was not refuted. it was not denied, as i understand it.
that's one reason. it would also 
did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution?
and nixon  okay. you have the inquiry and nixon just stands there, the same, doesn't say a thing, assuming you could get him into the courtroom, you know, assuming he had put his clothes on so you could bring him into the courtroom. he just  he just sits there.
well, i think we would disagree with that, for two reasons. the first is that the federal circuit, as justice o'connor noted, reserved  resolved these questions entirely as a matter of law, based on a de novo interpretation of the statute, without regard to the jury instruction. and that's the holding that's now before this court.
mr. cochran, i have this concern: if we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any sixth amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact. but the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal. and the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate  the appellate court says oh, no, this person had  we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account. and, therefore, we set it aside. now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. isn't  in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination? he would not get that sentence but for this fact.
 to defend than the cigarette package.
so you haven't shown us a way out of the problem.
 to the twinkie 
so you don't  you don't agree with what justice souter was saying, that all it's  all it's making is a colorable basis.
well 
right.
i am asking you, really what i'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the public disclosure that everyone agrees was made? was it all newspapers?
not in the habeas context. none of those 
it is.
but there is no such  that  that's very far from this case, general lockyer.
but the flip side of that in colville was that if the  if the tribe, in that case, had been selling to people who would have been on the reservation anyway  in other words had not come onto the reservation to take  just to take advantage of an exemption from state taxation  but would have been on the reservation anyway, the court specifically contemplated, in that situation, that the tax might well be preempted, because it would be interfering 
i think the problem 
so tell me.
okay. there is no judgement concerning anybody else.
exactly.
we would  we would look at it this way. if i'm  say i have 12 compounds that i'm going to test and decide which is best and go forward with. at the time i'm doing a test on any one of those compounds, if those tests succeed, it's reasonably foreseeable i'll submit an ind for that compound.
what  sorry, go ahead.
why is that showing  and i agree with, by the way, with the chief's suggestion a moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a half percent reduction from the 6 percent. but isn't it intuitively reasonable to suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the damage? isn't that fair?
yes.
we would respectfully submit that  that even the mississippi court has addressed that situation in  in a case cited in  in the briefs in mease. and there, the defendant asked five times for instructions, lesser-included offense instructions, and never actually got them right. the court said that that is not a basis upon which to deny the instruction and then, citing beck, said that where there is a proper lesser-included offense, the fact that the  that the defendant does not request the proper instruction still rises to the constitutional proportions that a beck claim does.
if the federal government were running the program itself, rather than having it  private entities administer the program for it, would you make the same argument?
 for a hardship claim, a parent-child relationship?
it's because we have a joint venture of entities operating over a long period of time that have victimized a large number of people, and there's a pattern of racketeering activity. and 
there is  there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.
well, what's wrong with that? the prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to convict him. what is wrong with it on the button? what risk does the button raise that the prosecutor's argument does not? that's what we're getting at.
 the defendant negligent. is that more or less a conclusion of law? we don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. and here, were these police officers acting  did they use excessive force.
that  that is certainly our first argument, absolutely, your honor. the point i'm making now is that if you look at the context in which this language was used, smith foreclosed the award of section 1988 fees. congress responded shortly thereafter by  by adding the precise language of section 1988 to the language in idea's predecessor. now, however anomalous it would normally be to give the same language in two different fee provisions different meanings  and it would be quite anomalous  to do so here with section 
counsel, the thing that concerns me about your case is that california's system looks a lot like the federal system after booker. we haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving review of reasonableness for upward departure. but at least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case, the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any reason for departing from what the guidelines might suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be  i think in most circuits, that would be reversed. same here. if a california judge imposes the upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to be reversed. but if a federal judge gives a statement of his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most circuit law, that's going to be upheld. here, if the california judge does that, that's going to be still struck down under your view. you talked about blakely and apprendi. but how does this system look to you under booker?
the fact is, we're looking at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the first petition that was filed; is that right?
absolutely. and they also could have  what i think i would envision them filling is an even narrower provision that seeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like steffel against thompson would be the model, that say that this statute can apply in an emergency situation.
your honor, the statement that travelers quotes from collier is about a proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it is a pre-petition claim. but collier.
it has to be purchase-by-purchase to determine like grade or quality?
his wife is living in the house?
quite simply, your honor, it's because the court doesn't need to reach that issue and didn't need to reach it in any of its prior cases save one and that's the benson case where that issue came up really in one sentence of the opinion. in the morse case, in the funk brothers case, in the flook case, all of those patents had  were limited to a particular use. just take morse's patent which was limited to just conveying information at a distance through electromagnetism. that was actually one very small sliver of what you can do with electromagnetism. in fact, very, very small. and the court said, no, it doesn't matter. where what you have is effectively the patent on the correlation, it doesn't matter whether you've limited it to one use or many uses. so if the court 
well, i don't know that  i don't know whether people like competition. but the antitrust laws like competition and this court likes competition. and this court has said that interbrand 
didn't it say that the  that the intermediate court's denial of  of appeals was a discretionary judgment?
 of the due-process hearings that occur in 
i don't think so, mr. chief justice, with respect. there are two education finance incentive grant program, or efig, provisions that we identified in the briefs and one of them i would acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, although i don't think it's persuasive. but it's the other one that i'm focusing on, and what the other one does is to explicitly incorporate the secretary's regulations and so what congress said in 1994 is that for purposes 
that provision is very  very reasonable as applied to qui tam actions. it doesn't seem to me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation action.
well, again, we  i think we could look at shaare tefila as  as a good example of the kinds of damages. this was the nazi swastika on a synagogue.
that is a policy choice that congress made when not providing a special mechanism for appellate review of remand orders.
isn't that so?
 therefore, it's compensable.
your honor, i  i think the  the focus of the answer should be on whether it is an employee benefit or not.
no, no. he's not acquitted.
justice souter, in that instance, we did not say that it was an independent constitutional requirement that there be a health exception, but certainly reading this court's cases, we should apply our act in a manner to protect if that rare case arises where an emergency abortion would come forward. and, if a physician were prosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not only would he have a statutory ability to say this prosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also given those rare circumstances, we do not think that he, under the constitution, may be prosecuted.
no.
 on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and  and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.
well, except that, under their theory of this case, it is always excluded. always. so that whatever else you can say about the meaning of that particular language, the interpretation the secretary offers to you today flatly rejects 
justice ginsburg, i suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds. i don't think, though, that  i think that would obviously be a much tougher case than the posting of the ten commandments in the outer hallway along with a variety of other documents which i take it to be the first case here. and then the final display that the court has before it is actually the ten commandments in the context of the other secular historical documents. and i think that kind of display clearly is constitutional for the reasons that the display was constitutional in the lynch case.
well, what's wrong with that, justice scalia, is that all ira's are designed and they're administered on forms that the internal revenue service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. so under their theory, there has  there is not now and there has never been a single ira anywhere in the united states 
no. no. no. no. if congress wants to change preponderance to clear and convincing, it can.
no, but isn't  isn't the difference that in the latter period, the court took no action, and there is a mandate on the court to act? with respect to this earlier period, the court did act. incidentally, it did exactly what the defendant wanted it to do, but it acted so that the only  the only reason for arguing error here is, in effect, a clerical reason. he didn't say the magic words or make the magic conclusion. if, in fact, that's because he couldn't have made it, no question. you  you got a violation of the statute. but if he could have made it and  and simply didn't say the magic words, you're in a very different position here from what you are in  in the case of  of the failure to act on the  on the competency issue.
no, it has not. they are putative class actions, your honor. but i, but i think that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look at what did, what did congress presumably have in mind when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive damages based on a willful violation in a technical area where there is no potential for harm? and certainly 
but that 
you don't  you don't set forth the main qualification to the main definition in a  in a later subsection.
but, mr. clement 
 and objective 
yes, justice scalia, because the representations that are made to the magistrate to secure the warrant include the fact that the warrant will not be executed and the agents should 
justice kennedy, i cannot, i regret to say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790. i can tell you  and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of interest to the court  that the dogs who train  who are trained to alert to detect things  it's not that they are sniffing things that all dogs can't already smell. it's rather that they are trained to let the handler know that they've smelt whatever it is they've been trained to smell. so the smells that are coming out of respondent caballes' car are exposed to every dog.
well, your 
we believe that pl-110 allowed the admission of people essential to the united states without any comment on whether they had formerly been spies and that these regulations do not require us to prove as an essential element even to the cia, much less to the district court 
yes. because the issue is to whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the child is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of course 
 within his job duties.
well, how about justice breyer's hypothetical? is the  is the court under erisa incapable of dealing with that situation, or is isn't it?
justice ginsburg, i  i would put my answer in this context. there are many sources from which the government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts. it could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on federal functions and secretarial administration. it could have been from the up to $88 million increases congress was making every year. it could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.
the principal means by which other prisoners would know about it is the very effective prison grapevine, although it does appear in the  in a chart that's appended to the handbook for the special management unit, and 75 percent of the inmates who wind up at level 2 come from the special management unit. the other thing i would point out about the effectiveness of this program, as opposed to the give-up-on-them proposition, is that even at  even in 2002, when the program was only 2 years old, 25 percent of the inmates who had been sent there had graduated. the statistics on that are at pages 7 and 8 of our reply brief. finally, if  if the court were to affirm the court of appeals, then this case has to be sent back to trial and the burden is put on the prison system to demonstrate empirically that this regulation can achieve its goals. in a sense, i've just demonstrated that it has achieved its goals, but much more importantly, the effect of that would be to totally undermine, if not void, turner and overton.
mr. chief justice, it would, but it would be much more narrowly focused in terms of bringing it as an as-applied challenge, this was brought 
yes, that is correct.
the other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part. i'm a trial judge. i've never heard of this case, kind of case before. i just was appointed. i read the statute. and i say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and yours doesn't. i'll play it safe. i'll go with the statute. all right? now, how could that be an error?
well, you can't say that the government agrees to that. you certainly agree to it.
may i ask you one other thing about the setting? when you went to the web site to get further information, what was conveyed about senator feingold when you went to get that further information?
i think, justice scalia, you'd have to actually look at the specific facts of the case and make a determination.
it's about the right to argue and what the jury is told to do with that. and it's also that the state is going to have to live with this decision in other capital cases, and other capital defendants 
 we didn't have 15.
oh, i'm sorry. with respect to district 23, again i  i think the  the framework for the plaintiffs' challenge to section 23 is the south and west region of the state in a claim that they were entitled to a seventh  a seventh effective majority district in that part of the state. the state's plan, 2003 plan, gives them six majority minority districts. the plaintiffs, gi forum 
yes, i think congress wanted to treat a frustrated burglar the same 
 discrimination 
 and that is my answer to justice scalia's question. it  it depends on whether the  what the court believed the intent of the great grandson was at the time the promise was made.
and, your honor, our test allows for that, as well. it's up to the district court to decide whether, in that particular case, the circumstances require the application. there is some discretion. i don't think that the state could 
that's right, your honor.
what's the point?
you're absolutely right, your honor, that there are going to be hard cases. if i could just start by answering that by saying i think one thing that's clear is that this case is not one of the hard ones. the challenge to the underlying contract here 
yes. they give 
those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in.
under heck v. humphrey, if the outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the 1983 case. here, the allegation is simply that they were entitled to counsel. that's not the substantive merits of whether the claim  whether they are properly convicted or properly sentenced. the sixth circuit, in a case decided august 31st 
justice stevens, i think it's important to say that the alternative rule that pg&e asked for is one that every court of appeals to have addressed has rejected. what they are saying is, oh, you can't get your attorneys' fees based on a construction of the bankruptcy code. no court of appeals has accepted it. there are some lower bankruptcy court decisions that have accepted it, but that is routinely overturned on appeal. the issue of whether you get your attorneys' fees as part of an unsecured claim, cohen versus de la cruz, in that case this court had to construe whether the term debt, which means under the bankruptcy code the same thing as a claim, is defined as liability on a claim, there the court, this court concluded that that debt included attorneys' fees, the treble damages, the whole nine yards.
they are in the brief.
 the federal circuit did understand that this was a jmol case 
well, justice ginsburg, two things. one, in bowen, there was  there is certainly always a degree of discretion. but it is worth noting that in bowen as in flast, the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious. in bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations. in flast it did so by saying money was going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go to private schools. and that was at a time when this court roughly contemporaneously, in lemon v kurtzman that 93 percent of the private schools were religious. the both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, that money is being spent by congress on religious entities, was not within the discretion of the executive branch. and again, the way i would understand kendrick is simply reconciling valley forge and flast and cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to executive branch action, which would have overruled valley forge, but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.
if 7426 had not been enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as interpreted by williams.
why isn't it enough that you killed somebody?
yes, justice kennedy. under section 501(b)(1) 
would you say that again?
well, there are more efficient ways than rpm to achieve any benefits of efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to provide those additional demand creating services. he could pay the retailers to provide those services. he could provide those services directly, i would suggest.
you're talking about district 25. right?
well, if you look at page d-21, mr. chief justice, what you'll see is actually proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity, because she said on page d-21 all it does is predispose you to being an addict yourself. but fetal alcohol syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability. if i could just say 
just saying that he knew it. without saying why they knew that he knew it? you're saying they have to give a reason why they knew that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports? suppose they didn't say that. they just said knowing that the  that the figures were otherwise, he  he set them forth.
now, if you're willing to  okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there is good reason here or not.
well, i don't understand it. we wouldn't vacate the judgment in part. if we reversed, 
and the defendant could be convicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could he not? official
yes, sir that is 
do you really want the policeman to say i got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and get a warrant? that's ridiculous. (laughter.)
what should have happened? if, suppose that ms. ahlborn had cooperated. would there have to be an agreement among all of the parties as to the breakdown of the  of the settlement?
each doctor testifies about their own dilation protocols, your honor, and i believe that's in the eighth circuit appendix. those  those  portions of that testimony, and are cited more specifically in the eighth circuit briefs, which goes more into the factual detail, your honor, but i don't have the cites right now. i'm sorry.
yes.
after the 
no, no, congress has actually passed special legislation that the mandeville farms is consistent with the farmers cooperative and so  you want me to write the proposition that the antitrust laws are not concerned 
i think it would not, your honor, because the self-insurance for workers' comp, as i understand them, what they normally do is, just as the court referred to in that omitted section of the pegram opinion, is it simply is  is an agreement that it will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding to pay the benefits as specified, as they may change from time to time in a state statute. there is none of the other things, as i understand it, that the court dealt with in pegram which would make it a plan that are present in either a workers' compensation insurance policy or a self-insurance program, as is permitted and 
moore?
horizontal conspiracies, even among a single brand, has always been a per se violation of the antitrust law. you can look back at the 
that's  that's 
well, this is part and parcel of benefits, justice ginsburg, because you're right that when  and when an employee asks for benefits, you'd expect that issue to be litigated in federal court. but this is a condition on benefits. that's how the reimbursement obligation is framed in the contract. it's that if you get benefits from the federal government and then later on get the same benefits from a third party, a condition on the government benefits is at that point you have to reimburse the federal treasury. so i don't think that one can easily draw a distinction between benefits qua benefits and benefits that are at  at one point issued to the employee but then are subsequently returned pursuant to the terms of the reimbursement obligation.
so you say that even if he didn't see him throw the punch and  and draw blood, they could have gone in just because they heard somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?
there is no baseline level of protection that is available by statute or civil service protections. if the court recognizes that the speech involved here, exposing government misconduct and so on, is important for first amendment purposes, as it has previously recognized, then it's  then it needs to be a baseline level of first amendment protection. and then if whistle-blower statutes are passed that protect it beyond the baseline level, that's fine. i'm not maligning whistle-blower statutes. but there is no such level of protection that is guaranteed. for someone in his position, if the first amendment does not protect his speech, it's just not protected. and i want to get back to  i started to say why it's so important that the speech be protected. it's not just that the public needs to have a government of public servants, but the government needs to know how it's operating. how can government function efficiently and effectively if it does not possess the information it needs to make responsible choices? when an employment decision is actually made because the employee has made a bad judgment and he reached an unwarranted conclusion in his memo, or the manner in which he conveyed it was terribly indiscrete, he publicized n front of the whole sheriff's department, and embarrassed them, when that's an issue, then the employment can respond, and the courts will make quick  short shrift of those cases, as they do now.
that was one of the reasons, but the primary reason that the  that the confession itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and that was what the court specifically pointed to in his opinion.
well, the question then would be harmless error analysis. i mean, we agree the statute requires the finding to be made. it was not made. therefore, there was an error. and it's the defendant inducing the court to 
okay.
well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it  it sort of interrupts the  the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a  on  on a practical effects analysis under pike.
why  why can't it?
well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a lindy pen case, according to  the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.
that might not be inconsistent, but the  the  to follow that up with, therefore, you can do a no-knock entry automatically is inconsistent with the richards decision. the 
if there were a plea  if it were a plea of guilt, wouldn't this be an academic question because i assume florida has some counterpart to the rule 11 colloquy where the judge must confront the defendant and ask him a series of questions to elicit his consent? so this issue can come up, if you have a counterpart to rule 11, only in the concession of guilt by the attorney but with a trial.
well, we always  we always will have disparity in the real world and that  and that's because lots of things cause disparity. in this case actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of disparity because there are no significant local tax revenues at issue here. but disparity happens  in the top three or four districts in new mexico you have under 100 students, or slightly over 100 students. in a district that small, minor things, an insurance recovery for example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance recovery in a district of 87 students will generate $3,000 of revenue per member for that year. it's a distorting figure. that's precisely what congress is trying to get rid of. but when congress says 5 percent, presumably congress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform applicability across the country and not vary with a state like new mexico where it would just eliminate five districts. or in our  in our neighboring state of maryland, montgomery county has the highest per-pupil revenues in the state. it has 16 percent of the population. under petitioners' view, that  and it has 24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under petitioners' view. it would completely be eliminated. yet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within that and we would keep it in. so 
mr. frederick, would you clarify one thing for me? i don't know how we even get to the second question, about partnership. if you're right that lincoln is a corporation  it's a texas corporation, with its principal place of business in texas, end of case; it's the only named defendant  so, how do we get to something about a partnership?
he has to challenge each administrative action 
yes.
well, that was my  even in the chief justice's hypothetical, i  i take it the client has a right to direct the attorney what defense to present, or am i wrong about it?
that's correct. and it's a very substantial issue, because essentially what ferc proceedings are  under the hydropower sections of ferc, essentially what they are is environmental proceedings, where there's a determination made about water quality issues that are then balanced off against energy issues. if the  under prior interpretations, the 401 powers have become quite robust. if we now take the threshold of "discharge into the navigable waters," and interpret that in a way so it essentially applies in all situations, ferc proceedings essentially will be a mail office, where they receive the conditions from the state and have no choice but to file them  follow them. our position is that congress intended to leave some room 
yes. in fact, justice scalia, if this opinion by the federal circuit were interpreted to hold that preclinical experiments are categorically excluded from the scope of the exemption, that holding would be inconsistent with the district court's interpretation of the law, because the district court's interpretation of the law was that preclinical experiments are potentially eligible, and the district court submitted the question to the jury. so the federal circuit would be completely inconsistent, if, on the one hand, it categorically excluded preclinical experiments, and, on the other hand, it approved the district court's reasoning.
well, your honor, the michigan court of appeals had taken the position that this was a fee, not a tax, and under a fee  if  if a fee was $10,000, if the expenses matched the  the revenue from it, well, then it  it would be a  could be sustained as a fee. now, if were a tax 
well, i think there are two components to your question, justice kennedy, and let me see if i can answer both of them. the first is whether the determination that the federal court in philadelphia, for example, in this case, was an inconvenient forum. would that determination be binding on the court in san francisco? our view would be probably not. it would be persuasive in that case, but the forum non conveniens 
the buffal creek 
that's the criterion.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the speedy trial act protects the public, as well as the personal interests of defendants, by mandating the prompt disposition of federal criminal prosecutions. in this case, the government and the district court failed to comply with the clear requirements of the act. as relevant here, the act provides that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is released on bail shall commence within 70 days after the indictment. the act, however, is not as inflexible as it sounds. the act permits numerous categories of delay to be excluded from the 70-day limit. the act also provides an enforcement mechanism. if more than 70 nonexcludable days elapse between the indictment and the trial, the indictment shall be dismissed. this case concerns two periods of delay, that each exceed the 70-day time limit, and i'd like to focus initially on the longer period of delay. this is the delay that took place between 2000 and 2001, after a competency proceeding was taken under advisement. just to put this delay in context, a competency hearing was held on july 10, 2000. the judge solicited post-hearing briefs. the matter was taken under advisement on august 23rd, and in our papers, we asked the judge to find petitioner competent and to set the matter for trial as soon as possible. we noted that at that point the case was already more than 4 years old. we offered to waive a jury and proceed to a bench trial immediately. and at that point, the case sat idle for the next 195 days. now, the act excludes only the first 30 days of that period. that's section 3161(h)(1)(j). for reasons that have never been explained, the court sat on the proceeding. when 7 months went by, we filed a motion.
yes.
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: respondent asks this court to recognize a new constitutional tort under bivens and the just compensation clause 
yes.
and it'd be true if there were 20 competitors too?
they did, justice scalia. now, but they did enter the house prior  they entered the house prior to a lawful triggering condition. in such an example, they could have contacted the magistrate immediately, advised what had happened, who would have realized at that point that a crime had not been committed, that there was not probable cause that this crime, the knowing receipt, had been committed.
we would, justice scalia, but i guess if we can start with the proposition that tributaries are covered and then some things that the corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that would be fine. but that would be a different case. that hasn't been the theory that this case has been presented. as i understand, these drains here are actually, you know, substantial channels that do have water in them. i have no doubt that the pine river meets the test that it sounds like you would have for a tributary, and the difficulty i'm having is i'd be happy to defend what the corps did if this court, in the  in the litigation of this case, had focused the court's and the corps' attention on that issue.
you  you agree that's  that's a proper way to look at the issue then.
and here we claim that it is a core matter.
i think, for example, in this court's decision in colville, where the court stressed there that the court was marketing an exemption from state taxation; that portion of the analysis of the court there did not turn on whether the tribe was imposing its own tax. it turned 
that's a moral judgment, isn't it?
well, in our brief we cite to many, many cases, your honor. i would  i would specifically refer you to 
no. i mean, make up one 
my  my recollection under washington's law would be  72 hours is the time for the charge.
because you  at trial we showed what the practice was.
 in circumstances that are similar.
do you have a lot of cards that have the same cards that have the same number? you have a lot 
i 
the practical approach to the problem is to look at the statute that says you have a year. if you file your petition within that year, whatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take to federal court and be confident that it's exhausted. if you want to do something after that year, you can't be confident anymore. all you have to do is  is count a year. now, if something comes up after that time, you're supposed to go to state court first, even if you've got something in federal court. this statute of limitations isn't supposed to be interpreted in order to make the federal successive petitions standard moot and unnecessary. it exists for a reason. so if a  if a claim arises at a later point, after you have finished your guaranteed review in state court, go back to state court, whether or not you've got something pending in federal court. don't put that new claim in with your old claims in federal court because then you have a mixed petition. if you get exhaustion in state court, whether you're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust. you can then go back to federal court with a request for a successive petition. it  that's what you have to do and that's appropriate because that's how congress set up the statute, with the 1-year filing deadline and  and a provision for successive petitions.
as we indicated in our brief, we think that raises a potentially serious pre-emption problem and it also raises the anticipation problem, that is, the section 102 argument which is not before the court but if it were litigated 
 mootness in this case.
wouldn't it be normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we don't have to reach out and decide whether this error was harmless if we've already decided there's no error at all?
but the question is when there is a violation and  and if it's from lack of education or lack of effort on the state's part to ensure that people understand the obligation, then does the treaty give the individual the right in a criminal proceeding to have that lawfully obtained evidence kept out of the proceeding. and so certainly we can make better efforts to improve compliance with what is an obligation that we have under the treaty, but that doesn't take this court to suppressing the evidence in the criminal proceeding, and that's what petitioner has sought from the court.
 prisoner  oh, i thought that he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do, if 
well, would it be a proper analysis simply to  to separate or not based on gang membership?
but the  the claim that  i'm sorry.
but 
the 
we certainly agree, justice ginsburg. we'd go one step further and note that in brown, this court said that the effects of segregated schools are worse.
no, but this  that's all hypothetical. you're litigating this case. you must have something in mind. whom do you have in mind as your best analog?
no, i'm just thinking, that suppose you have a reservation but the tribe doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long-term lease or a sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe. i would think  am i right that the city or the county in which that reservation sits can't tax it anyway?
 may i ask one question just to find out? are you contending that there is a sharp distinction? there's a category of issue ads and a category of election ads that are mutually exclusive?
may i  may i  has that always been your view throughout? (laughter.)
for attempts?
that's correct.
yes.
no. i acknowledge in this case it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. for example, we cite a decision of the washington supreme court, state v. collins, which involves essentially the same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling, the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the charge.
the  the box on the warrant is. again, i think that you need to 
congress isn't always precise, is it?
well, i certainly would not disagree with that in 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: i  i think it's clear at this point that the government really is asking this court to rewrite the csra on the fly. as late as page 48 of their brief on the merits, they wouldn't tell us whether our client should go to federal district court or to the court of appeals. then in response to justice scalia's question, they say, well, you could rewrite 2302(a)(2)(a)(xi) and (x). and i think the csra is a sufficiently detailed and comprehensive statute that this court has resisted rewriting several times.
your honor, i think since the  the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute should not be construed to impair state law  and there are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only have one construction of the statute  i believe that the construction would be an across-the-boards construction, that this act does not provide damages and you would not vary from state to state.
right, and the court  the court superceded those decisions in cases like carmichael coal and storaasli company and cases like that, where the court said excise taxes can be imposed. as long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent. and it would be an odd result to have the first amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this. after all  and professor tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's beef board were gotten rid of. it actually  the principal point here is the secretary controls the speech. whatever the cattlemen's beef board does  and that is a government entity  the secretary controls the speech. so that  this is not some jury-rigged system; this is a system of governmental control. congress has prescribed the message, and the secretary carries it out. it's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds  for highways, for other functions like that. and out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety. so the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter. and this case is completely different from cases like keller. in keller, the state bar was not appointed by the  by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera. this is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech. and, as justice o'connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences. there are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this. there are 13 at the national level. this program has been in existence since 1988. one billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it. these promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even  and even earlier. and there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows. this court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional. it's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer. yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. and the very first finding that congress made in the beef act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet. when the  when the  because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers. so this  the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers.
well, you could look to the case of jerome against united states, which is  which was a unanimous decision of this court  in which the court held that the  just the phrase "any felony" 
no. so your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. you don't have to show that there is no confusion.
the right direction would be to say, "please don't talk to us."
is there any statistical text that you could look at to see it that's the way people use the words?
well, fine. so, then, what is  would  if he thought it was a wild animal, then he would not have known right from wrong in respect to killing that individual.
what do you say in that respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went out and told the sheriff, help, i'm being beaten up, and that that evidence wasn't admissible?
well, at that level of generality you might be right, but with respect to the purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those acts the purpose is exactly the same. in impact aid, just like in efig, the question is to what extent has the state equalized expenditures across school districts. it's the very same question.
that's absolutely true, justice souter. but  this case is obviously about statutory construction, but it's about statutory construction in a very special area, and that is the area of federalism, of the relationship between the sovereign states and the federal government. we think it's clear, from examining the statute, that congress intended to retain and respect the historic powers of the states to define legitimate medical practices.
right.
would you not 
do you think your, do you think your schools as they are operated now are segregated?
okay. you will pay nothing.
what's your third? i just don't want you to miss your third. you have the joint venture theory, an exception to an assignment in income, and you said you had a third.
well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before. there's no change in terms.
but that wasn't  the district court, in this very case, seemed to say, "i think this suit should go forward, but there's gen-probe, and i must follow gen-probe." the district court, at least as i read it, seemed to think that gen-probe moved in a different direction from where the federal circuit was before.
well, this is a very unique fact situation. we're trying to announce a rule that will govern the typical transaction. and is it not true that typically the homeowner will know whether or not he's paid his taxes?
 have the same result? suppose there's a change in  in the antitrust law and  and the person says this change  this change has the  the effect of  of denying me equal protection of the law. that's the claim that the  that the client would have. but there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this change will mean there are many  many fewer antitrust suits. i can demonstrate that. that's my specialty, antitrust law. i'm going to lose a lot of business. why wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection claim of the prospective client?
i  i didn't handle the case in the trial court, but i believe that the  our  our client denied all of the allegations in the complaint and affirmatively said this was  its salary program was a reasonable factor other than age, yes. and certainly in the courts below, the reasonable 
and the $20,000 would have been a permissible bid even if the market value was $40,000.
 when it's, say, a job fair, and all the employers are there, but then they jeer just the  and the school organizes a line jeering the  both the recruiters and the applicants, that's equal access?
well, it hasn't been paid yet.
yes. yes, your honor. may  mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: in many of the cases  and i  i will try to  in mr. austin's case and many of the other cases, people didn't get a notice. i'd like to try to explain what they get and what they don't get. first, they do not get a final decision which gives them reasons.
well, justice stevens, if you put me in that position, i will be an advocate for the state. however, it is our position, as justice ginsburg alluded to, that the state has no death penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the death penalty for the state to have one. and that is borne out in case law. there is no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the state to seek appeal in charging death once there is no death statute that is available. the references in kansas law to ksa section 22-3602(b) are a very settled area of the law. the respondent argues that subsection (1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to preserve this issue below. however, that only relates to the state being able to appeal charging documents, and the definitions of those documents are very specific in kansas law. furthermore, subsection (3) states that a prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very clear, and that is only if the kansas supreme court sees that issue as important for the administration of justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the state, and has interpreted that to mean only where guidance of the supreme court is necessary. it is not a method for moving for rehearing. the kansas supreme court rejects that. we moved for reconsideration and reconsideration was not granted. if this court embarks, as the respondent asks it to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases and prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued in kansas. it will effectively strike down the laws of seven other states that have functionally identical statutes as kansas. and furthermore, it would effectively call into question the laws of five other states that do not even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. this court has never gone further and required a specific mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it should, to the states as long as the juror has the opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based on the consideration of all mitigating evidence relevant to a decision other than death that relates to the character, the background of the defendant, or the circumstances of the offense. and if you would look in your joint appendix on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that the state of kansas gave in this case, and it is undisputed that the respondent's presentation of mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full, and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed to consider and give weight  i'm sorry. it's pages 24 and 25  specifically instructed to give weight to all of that evidence. pages 24 and 25. i am referring to instruction number 4. and you will see the delineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating evidence that was admitted as relevant in this case. and i would also say that kansas continues to bear a greater burden in its consideration  for the juror's consideration in that the juror is instructed on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of itself is sufficient  is sufficient  to outweigh the aggravating evidence presented by the state. so contrary to the 
i  i think you're  you're right, your honor. i mean, i think the  the point is it  it just doesn't make sense to say that you have to go through all the bells and whistles of looking at the validity of the underlying contract if the whole point of prima paint  i think this goes back to what the chief justice said is you just look at the arbitration provision as a severable contract. so to say that 
i suspect you could, actually. (laughter.)
well, your honor, there is no, there is no contention here about monopoly power. the focus here is on the conduct element of section 2.
your honor, i think as a facial matter, when you're putting somebody in long-term solitary confinement for years and years in a small cell with no possibility of parole, you're  i think you should give them notice of the reasons in sufficient 
well, yes.
well, i don't quite understand the  i take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and if they know that something they're working on is going to have copyright experience, you  have got copyright problems, you can't just say, "oh, well, the inventor's going to invent anyway."
you think the court "must."
then they would need to file  yes, your honor, and they would need to 
i don't know whether they are grieving or not, but i certainly know the sentiment that they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a button that says "hang musladin."
it would be there to be used, and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes. yes.
yes, and that's the only thing that's before the court.
well, altvater is difficult for you, isn't it? because there was an injunction in altvater, wasn't there?
and no one knows what that is.
fine.
right.
i'm sorry. what i'm saying is 502(b) when you read "as of the time of the filing of the petition," it says  that means, that must mean that it doesn't apply to post-petition attorneys' fees, especially when you look at 502(b) through the lens, as this court did in timbers, of the rest of the code. 506(b), all of these other attorneys' fees 
one of the issues is whether  when he spoke and said, "can i talk now?"  was that voluntary or not? who has the burden on whether it was, or not, voluntary, the state or the defendant, in your view?
 same thing with the person who veers to avoid the package that falls off the back of the mail truck.
he gets the basic information. he doesn't get a list of any evidence.
you don't? all right.
the sentence recites the language of the sherman act, that is correct. but what this court's cases indicate and what rule 8 requires 
 apply the rule of 
well, but you don't  you don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction. are you telling me you require a conviction? you  i thought you told me you don't require a conviction.
fair enough. but it's not an excited utterance. it's not a present sense impression. i can't imagine a hearsay exception that would admit it, which is really what brings us back to the core of our theory, too, and that is that  that under the confrontation clause, as defined in crawford, we now have an absolute rule covering a finite 
my answer would be that the law clearly provides that if that is the finding 
but  but you have just said that the  the court will look on its own to see if there are these exceptions.
justice breyer, i think that the rule derived from the williams and flynn cases is that courtroom  courtroom behavior that creates an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have  or have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial. and unless it advances some important state interest, some compelling state interest like the concern that i believe justice ginsburg raised about the forcing a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling cases, that rule i think allows the opinion in this case of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of the aedpa. i think that's clear. i think what the court below did was essentially apply the rule that i just discussed. and i think 
it would, but it's not a state-law question. they don't  whether it's pending during that period is not a 
and it either is or it isn't, not  not that it will be. it either is or it isn't. if it is, you  you need a permit; if it isn't, you don't need a permit.
they're talking about a plural banking associations, not just plural branches of one association. and it's in which each  in which they are respectively located, which strikes me as saying in  in which each of those national banking association is located, which seems to me to read as though there's only one location for each bank.
all right. forget it. (laughter.)
mr. chief justice, i don't  i don't  i'm not up here today saying there's no prophylaxis at all with respect to title ii, but i think it is proportional and congruent, and i think the prophylactic gap between what the constitution protects and what title ii protects is relatively narrow in the prison context, both because if you think about one set of claims, the turner claims, much of that deference can be brought in under the reasonable-modification standard; and then, if you think of the other class of cases, those involving deliberate indifference, i think in those class of cases, this is  the prison context is one of the rare contexts in which the state is under an affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to the medical needs of inmates, including disabled inmates. and i think the fact that here's a case where the constitution requires affirmative accommodation also helps narrow the prophylactic gap.
my concern is if you take that away, i don't know if you've got a lot left for the  saying no injunction in this case.
well, they might  halfway houses, as i understand it, justice ginsburg, are largely now a thing of the past. but if the idea is you would actually be in a custody situation at night, perhaps in lockdown, then perhaps hudson against palmer would come into play 
yes.
so, you 
where  where do you disagree with judge carnes?
in 
well, i think the  i mean, i  i agree that  i mean, whether it's waiver or it's estoppel, if congress manifests an affirmative intent to displace those doctrines, they don't apply. and it doesn't matter which  which one you're under. but the  the affirmative intent that congress manifested here, notwithstanding  i mean, remember, there's no express anti-waiver or anti-estoppel provision, but the affirmative intent is to protect the public's interest in a speedy trial. and that  that intent is entirely protected when a delay could be  is permitted by the substantive standards of the act, and the only error is a procedural one that the defendant helped to induce the court to commit. and i mentioned  in that circumstance, there's not only no delay that was not contemplated by congress. but as i mentioned before there are three reasons that permitting a defendant to seek dismissal in that circumstance would actually harm speedy trial rights. first, the incentive for defendants to delay. second, the inefficiency, and the third is that, remember, one of the main reasons, if not the main reason, that congress wanted speedy trials was that it was concerned that defendants out on bail were committing crimes. and congress' concern with crime prevention is not served in the least by letting a defendant seek dismissal of an indictment based on a purely procedural error that he helped to cause.
 i suppose, in the  in the miranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the time of trial.
they are, your honor, but they're about the whole school after four years of operating without the race preference. so each of the four years they're represented in the aggregate shows the effect that i think your honor was asking about. so, the record in this case shows the seattle schools are richly diverse. it's very important in our view that the court not lose site of that. we've talked about integration and segregation, but i urge the court to take a look at the data the petitioners submit regarding the actual enrollment in those schools. a couple of other record citations i'd like to bring to the court's attention. justice kennedy, i think, asked about considering race at a last resort. it's simply not the case that the school district looked at race as a last resort. and i would draw the court's attention to the superintendent's testimony at joint appendix 224 and 25, where he said in essence, the reason we didn't consider race neutral plans is because we were interested in racial diversity.
well, i suppose it's possible, justice breyer.
right, but congress 
well, now, douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, i guess.
in the first part of the 
wasn't  wasn't that instruction, itself, undermined by what i understand to be the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of what was being done was no defense? i mean, if you had an instruction that depended upon the word "subvert," i could  i could understand your argument. but it seems to me that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty with your answer to justice breyer, is that it went beyond "subvert" to merely "impede," and it included an instruction that good faith was no defense.
 to this court.
and scott has testified he didn't know it.
so he's not a school child, he would be playing hooky?
well, it depends on whether the contract speaks to the issue. now, insofar as the contract 
is there any other state that's done it the way michigan has?
 is that he cannot proceed in a section 1983 action. presumably what would happen 
so bring in a pre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with the act in emergency situations. why does that even implicate the vast majority of the cases that don't create emergency situations?
and we believe that  we believe of course that section 760 is not subject to strict scrutiny, it is subject at most to a rationale basis; and that clearly there is a rationale basis for the state in this case to require the affirmative authorization of non-member fee payers.
this is a very, very, with all respect, ridiculous line. i mean, i can understand you're saying you cannot promote things that are unlawful, but to say, oh, it's only violent, where do you get that line from, only violent unlawful acts?
my response is that you have those series of cases that say once you've achieved the unitary status, you know longer get to carve out that exemption to the fourteenth amendment, and if we're going to carve out these exemptions to the fourteenth amendment, if we're going to say we're going to not apply gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely, without any type of individual holistic review applied to these kids, then there should be some improvement in 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court. in 1988, the government of british columbia created powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the province's natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the united states. the ninth circuit, however, denied powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign state entitled to remove this case from state court to federal court. before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue, i'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the ninth circuit in rejecting powerex's organ status. first, the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign state. the factors the ninth circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the fsia; and second, the court overlooked crucial evidence of powerex's public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status. the british columbia government receives and distributes the proceeds from powerex's operations, supervises powerex through bc hydro, subjects powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation.
 it seems to me, a lot of this discussion has come down to. what are you curing? are you curing involuntariness of the confession, or are you curing the police badgering? i thought that we were just trying to cure the badgering and then let the voluntariness of the confession be decided as voluntariness is normally decided, for which purpose you would take into account that he's been  erroneously said he was charged with murder, or whatever.
the question that i asked mr. nager that i think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases? do you put it in the box with the hostile environment that builds up over time, and as long as the environment is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago. this notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other person got 3 percent, you really don't have an effective claim unless it builds up to the point where there is a noticeable disparity.
but that's not a violation of the section. "obstructing interstate commerce" is not a violation of 1951.
well, your honor, our view is what the court has said in cases like trinko, is that the test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct. those are the two elements. we are not contesting the monopoly power element. we are looking at whether there was anticompetitive conduct here.
so, i think there is.
thank you. the  with respect to the standard, there are two things that we have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing. one is that we're not disentitled under the analysis under section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the court's michael williams decision, to show that the court below found it, it was not raised in the cert petition. we pointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't raised, it had nothing about it. that's established and the case comes to the court.
 circumstance.
 is the general  the general ability to impose a tax. but here, the interest is augmented by the fact that the tax is dedicated by tribal law to maintaining tribal roads, not just this one-and-a 
may  may i ask this? because i think your example overlooks the fact that at least your opponent claims that the blue cross contract provision would preempt the new york law that denies your client recovery for health benefits.
that's correct. in  in 2000, the  the  while this case was pending, the michigan supreme court issued an opinion, the bulger decision that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. the statute was not in effect at that time. the statute took effect, and in a case just decided in june of this year, people v. harris, the michigan supreme court relied on bulger and said this statute is constitutional. it does not violate any rights.
well, a witness for  a  a claim that a witness for the government perjured himself during the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional conduct designed to subvert the process. and one of the advantages to using fraud is  is that it is a familiar bright line, workable standard for district courts. and with fraud, you have to plead a little bit more particularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some of the question marks that would come up 
i respectfully 
that's absolutely right, justice ginsburg, and i think the way we look at it is that this whole debate about the purpose of the provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid. if you look at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not have at least the effect of protecting workers. on the other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't address the entirety of germane, of non-germane expenses. it addressed a subset that have the most direct impact on the election process.
yes, justice o'connor, they also could have done that. and i think that the very fact that they couldn't resist the temptation to link the filibuster issue to senator feingold is not that surprising 
it should be in the briefs. it's not, but that is what the last section of section 507 says, that those who are subrogated to the rights of someone with a priority don't get the priority. so that's just taken care of by the statute.
yes.
 a price-fixer, tax-evader, speeder. do you think it's justified?
but they were  and they were intervened in this lawsuit. weren't they entitled to have notice that there was a settlement and that the case was going to be dismissed?
and why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?
 apa 
 that answer consistent with the position of defense counsel, who said he would not insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them that the religious conversion of the defendant did not extenuate the gravity of the crime?
yes, sir.
yes.
what was constitutionally mandated in your view?
on which  on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or  there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled. so it's not like money in the corporate till.
which statements make that unlawful?
well, it's not so much that there weren't appellate procedures, but that the procedures and the variance procedures and  and a multiplicity of agencies here were just so complex that it amounted to an  inadequate remedies to protect against a taking.
i'm not sure about that. this has been the rule in the majority of circuits for five or six years now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a lot of problems. and that's because, justice o'connor 
history and, not unrelated to that, the fact that the cable companies have not traditionally been regulated as common carriers under the 
 people inside to know that they're police, but they will not wait for a refusal, and they certainly will not wait for a reasonable amount of time for some 
general petro, before you get into the details of why  why you think the process here was all that was due, i'm  i'm more concerned about the preliminary question of whether there was a liberty interest here. i  i know you haven't challenged the existence of it, but i'm not sure that lets me off the hook. we  we had a case some years ago in which both sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they conceded in the  in the court of appeals that the statute existed and wanted us to say what this presumptively existing statute said. and we held, since there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been properly enacted, we had to reach that question first because we were not going to speculate on what a, you know, hypothetical statute said. and i think you're asking us to do sort of the same thing here. you're  if  you know, without even conceding or  the government doesn't concede anyway. the united states doesn't.
i certainly think that that follows from the  the overall test we propose.
and the irony here 
 facts of  sorry.
yes.
but, mr.  mr.  but may i point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. a police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.
well 
or am i wrong about that?
i think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. but i go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. we agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. we agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. but those have specific elements that have to be met. those elements weren't met in this case. history is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, your honor, it's quite important that mr. cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. in near v. minnesota, this court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the first amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this court in a defamation case. we're now 70 years later than that. to approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. no 
well, the  the problem that the board was addressing was principally a, a problem of the distribution of white and non-white students. the  as a generality, 75 percent of all non-white students in the district lived in south seattle. and that was true for all the ethnic groups except native americans, who are a very small 
and 
if there was just the palm print 
would the  the tax court rule  now, this 183(c)  says  it describes the special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a tax court judge, and then it says that  that the tax court judge may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or may reject it in whole or in part. does the tax court ever modify a special trial judge's report? does it ever reject it in whole or in part?
no, your honor. no.
they 
i think there are a number of ways to reconcile it. certainly massachusetts' position is that it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the trial court and went up on appeal. i think both of those factors are significant.
i mean, it carries all this goop somewhere else to  to dump it. right?
i believe so, your honor.
well, presumably, that's because the prisoners don't have a lot of choice as to which accommodations they're going to select. [laughter.]
i cannot cite to any right now, your honor. but 
state laws generally  state agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?
the  the uniformity which we're seeking, relative to these benefits, and the  and the argument as to uniformity i would submit to you, at least as to how we treat the federal employees, is illusory in this case because no matter how this court decides in this particular case, whether there's federal jurisdiction here or not, the employees are being treated differently state to state based upon the provision that blue cross blue shield has enacted.
in terms of the rule of 
 of damages.
that would be viewpoint discriminatory, but here we have a legislative statute that, that it's content discriminatory, that can't be justified as a compelling state interest to promote the integrity of the elections, and we believe the judgment of the washington supreme court should be affirmed. thank you.
no, but he says the fact of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim of a beating.
yes, but you're not considering how strong the government's case is and conditioning admissibility 
not 
 and not determine it as a threshold matter. so  so your answer, as i understand it, is pennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the third circuit requires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable thing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say in the abstract it's a purely threshold time question. and for that reason, there should be tolling. isn't that your argument?
a commerce clause problem, your honor, is posed only when the provision provides a benefit which is specifically distinguished and provided to in-state activity but not provided 
well, there was  in mccarthy, itself, the wording was something that  of the kind proposed. and so, it's not clear whether it's referring to  what was proposed was a rule that would incorporate a procedural default motion. it's not clear, just from the  reading that opinion.
well, but i  but i  with all respect, i think our interpretation certainly does not render heta nugatory, because heta would still override limitations periods for other forms of collection with respect to other types 
well, at least one circuit clearly.
just in terms of  of policy, i think any rule you adopt that's not mechanical and doesn't let people know on the front end whether they're tolling or not, there's going to be floods of protective filings. now, the  the rule like  a rule which is  which  where they know going in and whether they're going to be tolled or not, then they can say plead  litigate in state court becoming  before coming to federal court. and duncan v. walker was very clear that the court doesn't want lots of people filing prematurely. if i could, i'd like to turn to equitable tolling. as chief district judge giles found, that it would be an extraordinary deprivation of rights and patently unfair to deny tolling in federal review here, he found  judge giles found that if mr. pace had filed a federal habeas petition instead of his pcra petition, judge giles would have dismissed it and required him to do exactly what he did, which is to seek state remedies under the pcra. as judge giles found, mr. pace acted diligently and appropriately under the circumstances. it seems this is a clear case for equitable tolling. this is a case where 
yes. the state chartered corporation, wachovia mortgage, is exempt under michigan law from an annual examination.
then what do you  then what do you do with the croupier? you can't have it both ways.
i think that that's true, but i think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. it was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. it was not a graham v. connor type instruction.
here, justice scalia, there is, as was pointed out earlier in the dialogue with justice souter, a very close cooperation among mohawk and these third parties to get workers, to bring them from 
it's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible. but go ahead. (laughter.)
no, you.
yes.
and once it's acted, you're controlled.
well, i  i hope not, your honor, and i  i believe that we've gotten past the point. i mean, i think we now recognize how serious a  a crime domestic violence is. let me emphasize that it is just as now sometimes a prosecutor will compel a victim to testify. it will still be that sometimes they will and sometimes they won't. that will be a matter of  of state policy. there are other approaches as  as well. and  and hopefully, compulsion isn't necessary, i think, if the prosecutors pay  pay sufficient attention and  and care, but beyond that, there's the possibility of forfeiture. if, indeed, the reason why the victim will not testify is because of intimidation, then  then the prosecution  it is open to the prosecution to prove that. in many cases, the case can be proven 
yeah, but he did make additional findings. it goes on. in fact, 19 and 20 are additional findings.
well, but again, mr. chief justice, the national banks compete. and its undisputed 
i think it goes to the difference, your honor, between the public use standard and the  which governs in a situation in which the government is paying compensation. and in that standard, as we've been discussing today, in that context, the court has applied a very deferential standard because the  the burden on property rights is lesser and the  the impediment 
it emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review. call it a leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you want, but it is the first review. and in those two instances, state, if the defendant is poor, give him a lawyer. that's simple. that's clear. everybody could understand it. they may not even have a lot of legal arguments. now, what significant  what does that prevent a state from doing that it's reasonably important for a state to want to do?
mr. chan, can i ask you a question, based on your experience? i'm sure you've had a lot of experience in this area. this particular claim was about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he asked to relate back. it would seem to me that that would normally be the case, something about that amount of time would be an issue, because it takes time to process these, and they had to get counsel appointed. and counsel comes in and wants to amend the petition, usually, i suppose, in a pro se petition. is it  would i be correct in assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking about a delay of only a few months?
 you almost have to show that. but the evidence of the head-to-head competition, it seems to me, too insubstantial to support liability here. would you agree? i  and i 
all right. so has anybody said  he said, judge, i would like you to get rid of this jury which happens to be looking at the shackles. okay. now, at that point, you have to do  then isn't it up to the prosecution to say, what do you mean looking at them? they can't see them. they're hidden.
not so long as the jury was still there. if the prosecutor had the opportunity to say, judge donovan, give me 10 minutes, i know there's a supreme judicial court case on the point that i'm arguing to you, which is that you did not need a witness to directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than 16 inches, i know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and the judge said, absolutely, you're  you're correct, i'm going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double jeopardy violation there.
but 
but pike doesn't apply to discrimination. pike applies to burdens.
i can understand excruciating pain, but  but you  you want to press it to the point where there can't be any pain associated. any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated. that seems to me a very extreme proposition.
the second one, which i began to allude to before hearing some questions about  foreign government.
exactly. and we would 
the implications of your 
i know you're not arguing for "you always don't." [laughter.]
that is not in the record.
based upon the litigation that we've seen around the country, yes, i think there are acceptable ways to  to do it out there. whether they would choose that way or not, i don't know because the way florida's system is designed is  is that it's not statutorily mandated as to  as to particular protocol that's utilized. it's left totally with the secretary of the florida department of corrections. it's not subject to any rulemaking or any administrative procedures as far as promulgating those rules. it's  it's just within the secretary's discretion.
you can  generally in the  in  as a county  as a state law claim, no, unless there's a waiver. now, the legislature has waived  there's been quite a few waivers in the last year. they just waived in automobile insurance cases, for example. and  and that's a matter of the state.
respectfully, your honor, they did not say that. they did not anywhere say why the existing uncertainty mattered. to the contrary, they emphasized the need to act in the face of current uncertainty, but never explained why that principle applies to a nonregulatory approach but not to a regulatory one.
assuming that they're right for that  by their interpretation, this court has repeatedly said that it  that a  a state court cannot  by simply assigning matters that otherwise would be heard by federal courts to the probate court, that it can, in effect, shield those 
may i also ask, do you agree with the petitioner on the meaning of adverse action?
yes. the ninth circuit began with boyde, and it went through all of the proceedings at trial, and concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury didn't consider skipper evidence. and that's what we're asking this court to do, the exact same  applying the boyde test to the rule  the rule of decision that was clearly established by this court as of 1986, and reiterated and expanded by this court in 1987, with skipper.
it's very  it's very useful, i'm sure, but it  it could be very disruptive also, i am sure. if i were  if i were a coach, one of the first things  especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things i would do would be to complain about not  not getting enough facilities. this would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether  whether i'm a lousy coach or not. you  you would have to think twice before you fire me because i would have a retaliation claim.
no.
that's no more 
no.
no, because what you still need  there's still a higher  it's not just the higher threshold that it's got to be something that moves beyond what the corporation does. it has to involve the direction or the conduct of the operation of a separate entity.
 "in any way."
it is more than practically capable, it actually is  actually transports its equipment and its personnel at work and its 
i think that would be a basis for dismissal in this case. i was going to say i'm not sure whether that would solve the problem from petitioner's standpoint because 
now you said that in your brief, and i couldn't understand that somehow you got mileage out of his being truant that morning. would the case have come out differently, would you be making any different argument if he got to school on time and was released with the rest of them? does the case turn on the fact that he was late to school that day?
but you will  you will concede that there are many federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required. the shabani case requires you to recognize that.
well, now, would that be true also for any doctor who provided the substances to furnish an execution of a convicted death penalty convict?
no, your honor. the 
the master's 
but we know from the decisions of the ibla that he did challenge that they rejected the grounds that he 
now we agree with that or i'll hypothetically agree with that. they can't come in and eject people. but then i'm back to my first question, because i take it that the refusal in oneida to the suggestion that they can't go, say, to buffalo, new york, or wherever, or some town and throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does reflect the passage of time. but for a city or state to tax the land, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with people's expectation of living in the houses that they bought, that throwing someone out of his house would involve.
you won on the basis of the standard that the sixth circuit used, which was not your standard and not the eeoc standard. why should this court deal with anything other than that the petitioner's standard is unsatisfactory, that at least the sixth circuit standard  why should the court deal with the universe of cases when it has this case before it, two actions, and a unanimous sixth circuit judgment that says these two actions fall within 704?
you are actually saying the answer to the chief justice's question is that you would then review it de novo. but on de novo review, you would sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.
the respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this court said in state oil versus khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price. the respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a colgate system, which the ping brief demonstrates it's a blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems.
if we don't have proof at that point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose 
 the end of it, as well. and the model penal code makes this point when they talk about their formulation, which is a  whether a defendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct. and they, in their discussions, had indicated  and these are on pages 166 and 169 of the ali comments to the model penal code  that m'naghten could, under any formulation  a person could, in the abstract, know that killing is wrong, but could also, in the  in the  their subjective mental state, due to their mental disease, not know that they were killing a human being.
absolutely 
that would be the argument he's making. i would like your response.
that's right. and this case comes to us in the posture in which 
i think that  that that was what the michigan court of appeals 
no, you're 
it  it would not. that is all that's involved.
well, you're assuming there's longstanding precedents. it is also at least conceivable that at the time they thought the objection was properly preserved.
all right. if we assume, for the sake of argument, that there is disagreement on that point, are there any cases of this court on the matter of adequacy of state procedural bars that would support you, even on the assumption that it's a state, not a federal issue?
but you would still call that an equitable claim?
justice ginsburg, there  all of those questions are going to be answered as a predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the u.s. market.
 about whether she had abandoned the property. but the trial 
mr. frey, are you talking about what is numbered, is it number 34?
in the circumstance, justice stevens, i think that you put your finger on two different types of review. in the circumstance in which a district judge operates with what i'll call legal blinders on that prevent him from complying with 
i'm sorry. i will find it for your honor. i'm sorry for the delay here. the motion for rehearing is, i'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we raise it, and then subsequently  then subsequently we raise it 
but it's  we're not talking about the procedure, i mean, what procedural moves. what must you do to comply? and it has in there you don't retaliate. so you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the  the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? i mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.
justice ginsburg, if you adopt the other approach, what you say is that every change in assignments within the ordinary course of business is subject to claim by a plaintiff 
 as well as the language. okay, in terms of the policy, i'm simply saying that i don't know why you have a better claim than a copyright plaintiff, and i can think of why you don't have as good a claim as a civil rights plaintiff, the reason i said. so, what is your response to that?
well, you need what is called the plus factor, and i gather that you acknowledge that if i disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose.
let me ask you one preliminary question just to be sure i understand the case. is it your view  when the petition for removal was filed, did the district  federal district court have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in your view?
yes. there  i think there  this is a four-factor test, and there are questions of balance of hardship and public interest. and certainly equity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary hardship on parties. in the case of a nonwillful infringer, for instance, that has made good faith investments that might be set aside by the  by an injunction, there might be grounds in those circumstances not to issue an injunction. there's also a public interest inquiry as well. if the injunction would threaten national security, public health and safety, undermine core aspects of commerce 
and the component then would be either a disk which is put into a computer or the portion of the hard drive to which the code is transferred.
well, i don't understand. you know, as far as the impact on out of state competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same. the state or the municipality runs its own waste disposal facility. there is no charge for dumping the waste there. the cost of it is entirely covered by taxes. okay. now, the people you're representing, out of state people who would provide dumping grounds for this waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever they would charge. it would be more than what the municipality is charging. now, why isn't that a restraint on interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate commerce?
 are at issue.
yes.
 there it is your car, your property. that's not this. this is a generic ad on behalf of beef.
at this  at this point we're not at the harmlessness point yet. this would be 
because that isn't what they mean. i mean, for example, if somebody puts a stick in the middle of the river, no one  no one is claiming that the water that flows around the stick is being discharged. i mean, there are a lot  i don't know whether anyone wants to put a stick in the river, but  -
how can we check on that? no, he said that a number of other state statutes would be affected by our coming out the way you would like us, on this.
 was your client prejudiced in any way by not putting on some evidence that the  he would have put on?
i'm certain about the statute. you're provided the variable values that are attributed to each of the leas; you rank them; and you provide a percentile. it's a methodology which was described in 1976. it's a methodology employed every day in ranking students and schools.
so you  you go ahead. i'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. i'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. history makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within  or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. so i would like your response to that logic.
in thinking 
and if the only harms that the rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of nakedness and violence, once inside, and there are cases without nakedness or without violence, then, in those cases, there will never be a recovery.
i just have to make it clear. is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is greater than more likely than not?
the door is closed forever. i mean 
in  in terms of  of pleading guilty. do we have any cases in which a similar thing happened, that the counsel said i'm going to plead you guilty and the  the defendant doesn't say anything, just passively sits there as though, you know?
i'm sorry, justice scalia.
i'm sorry.
i suppose as a matter of criminal law they could.
in the second circuit, i do not. but i want to know why not.
no. that's  that's my mistake.
yes, but 
well, i  may  i want you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well. and perhaps the respondent is the one to answer this question. do you understand that they, on remand, if they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the mother's live testimony?
yes.
in my view, the immunity issue, but not the remand is reviewable on appeal 
i don't want you to agree to this unless you've focused on it and think it really is your position. i take it, as i'm listening, that you would not object to an injunction that says that this statute cannot be applied in any circumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself or herself, believes that there is a health emergency, period. now, i take it as soon as we get more narrow than that, you might object on the ground that that will leave ambiguous cases where there really is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't know what to do and would have to go to court, by which time it will be too late.
but your  but your approach is totally categorical. if you had a group that had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your position would still be the same 
what it is, is a system where i pick up the phone, and what my phone does is  let's say it had the ability to survey a number of possible people who wanted to talk to me. would that suddenly change it from a phone to a computer or an information system?
what's wrong with the explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she didn't want to across-the-board strike young people, but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had dominantly older people. so that wouldn't mean that she's withdrawing youth. it's just that she's saying it isn't an absolute with me.
and you need an objection or else it will be all right?
and it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year. i would point out that this is very important for kansas farmers that the  the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact. if water is  is not delivered, as required, in one year, it cannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10 years later, as would be possible under the special master 
well, nippert was over 100 years ago, wasn't it?
my 
and which is what the trial judge did below. and when the trial judge made that finding, that what blake was doing was responding  because the trial court is in that unique position that this court or any other public court can never be in, which is listening to the witnesses, we give the trial judges the duty to hear those witnesses and to make judgment calls based on what they hear from those individuals. we 
your honor, two, two doctors in particular, dr. chasen and dr. hammond, testified that they have used in their practice the vertex presentation to treat women who, as ms. smith indicated, the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that involved a greatly distended abdomen. the fetus presented in a head-first presentation. the head delivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way to complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the, of the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size because of the underlying fetal condition. in those cases, those doctors testified that that was absolutely the safest way to terminate the pregnancy for the woman. the only alternative way would have been abdominal surgery, which, which all the, virtually all of the doctors, even the government's doctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman than a vaginal surgical abortion.
it is, your honor, under the grable case that the court issued last year. a state law claim that turns on the construction of federal law, a substantial question of federal law, is removable to federal court and arises under federal law in the first place. i wanted to address justice souter's question of whether opm does approve the contract. there's no individual contract  excuse me  between blue cross and any individual enrollee. the statement of benefits is part of the government contract. it is attached at appendix a and the terms of the contract, the master contract, specifically say that in sections 2.2 and 2.5, that the benefits shall be  and  and reimbursement terms as well  shall be consistent with and incorporated by the statement of benefits, which is attached. and so it is part of the contract. there's no separate contract here. it's one 
we believe that it is 
i beg your pardon?
do you think his argument here contained any misstatements of the law?
could they put mr. deck in a cage? i don't think so. could they put 
 "is 4(a)(2)."
i take it kansas has not indicted the distributor for failing to register under the indian trading statute.
oh, what respondent is complaining about here is essentially a disparate impact. and this court has never recognize a disparate impact claim under the spending clause.
no. the question is whether he could go into the house, and are you saying that before he went into the house, all the noise stopped?
congress determined that it would defer to the states instead of exercising any further power beyond its channels authority.
that  that would be a possible tweak. i'm not sure if it would 
no, i  i don't agree that it's  that it really has a function in the sixth amendment that's independent of what the sixth amendment itself says, which is the assistance of counsel for his defense. and this court has made clear that in the context in which it's looked at and involving conflicted counsel, involving ineffective counsel, involving total denial of counsel, involving appointment of counsel or even the retention of counsel in a situation where no lawyer could be expected to perform in a competent manner and protect the defendant's rights, that all of those rights and interests are tied to the basic purpose of the assistance of counsel clause. it is not a expressive clause in the middle of the constitution. it is not a mini first amendment. it is a right that is tied to the purpose of the sixth amendment guarantee in helping assure fair trial outcomes.
well 
it says without delay that the information should be provided, but that phrase, without delay, when you look at the prefatory materials and how the icj has construed it, doesn't mean immediately.
yes, your honor.
precisely. and that's going to be true with every new protocol.
but 
well, again, i  i think it would be an interesting argument to revisit richards on this proposition.
in california, it does.
well, i don't think excise taxes are segregated in any way that makes  that makes it harder 
well, counsel, one thing you did  your client did was provide notice by publication in a local newspaper.
it is not. it is not clear at all from the record how many days.
 what are some other examples where congress has allowed this degree of financial liability to be subjected to the discretion of a district judge?
 in the other case it arises out of how he handled the vehicle. you don't care whether it's the mail or not. by the same token, when you trip over something  a box  you don't care whether it's a mail box or if it's the box from ups. and yet, in your case, it makes all the difference in the world.
 justice breyer.
i beg your pardon?
we agree that the united states has the regulatory authority to protect  to limit vessel entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not what our concern is. our concern is with the actual use of the submerged lands. this is a laboratory. this is a laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use the submerged lands for that purpose. that includes such things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze its historic features. we've installed a 5-mile cable with a hydrophone on the  on the submerged lands so we can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the  the volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that migrate through there.
 intentional torts fall within 2680(h). if i don't like you, and i intentionally deliver your mail to your neighbor, knowing that it's got your inheritance information in it, i don't think that would fall within 2680(h), which normally  it's essentially  largely encompasses interference with contracts rights instead of physical assault, battery, those types of claims. but, again, i think it's very important to keep in mind here that we do have  we have text  this is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and that this falls within the text. there are two ways of looking at it. their way does not capture important things to the postal service. it doesn't seem to capture what is admitted into the mails, and it doesn't seem to capture the important decisions that are made  it may not seem so important, in this one case, to have put the mail on the porch, but multiply it by tens of millions of times a day when that decision is made, and the decision that that balance, of putting things there in a sheltered way, hopefully that will both protect the mail and the people, instead of either reverting to person-to-person delivery for all oversized mail or making people come down, like the old days, to the post office to pick it up. thank you.
yes, sir.
and justice stevens, he probably could have cited two of your opinions for that proposition. but you know, the rest of us do have to work with 
you don't need the constitution to the sue the government for ramming your sailboat. basic state tort law.
i think, your honor, what the jury articulated is what this court has seen on many occasions, the jury's concern about does life without possibility mean life without.
how is this  to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable? no court has said that there's this  you only want the medical expenses, and no court has said there's this much for medical expenses. you have to figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to medical expenses. in fact, already did that. they cut out some percentage for attorney's fees. it's far removed from the traditional sort of res that we deal with in equity.
is 
and why shouldn't we treat this as a "may"? the judge noticed the clerical error and called it to the party's attention by an order to show cause.
well, taking our first argument to the side, our first argument which i've been discussing about what happened at the hearing, i think with respect to that argument the answer's no, that argument stands without any need to disprove the factual finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we don't concede that. but if it is a factual finding, then yes, we would have to disprove it by clear and convincing evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.
yes, your honor. i'm sorry.
i don't believe so, your honor, because our theory isn't that anytime you go beyond what free exercise requires, you're immediately into an establishment clause violation. we recognize that there is a play in the joints. and providing chaplains, given the  the rich history and tradition of doing so in prisons, seems to fall very comfortably within that play in the joints. the question is when have we gone too far. when has our accommodation slid over, as the dissent put it in texas monthly, into a  or an impermissible incentive to practice religion?
 the same tax as the tax in question here, your honor. it was a corporate income tax apportioned on the basis of the ordinary three factors that ohio uses, on the basis of where the company's sales are located, where the company's payroll is located, where the company's property is located. the two taxes, in westinghouse and here, were identical. there were some small differences in exactly the way that the credit was structured, but the underlying taxes were, in all respects, identical. the problem that the court recognized in westinghouse is that by giving a credit that was restricted to a particular kind of in-state activity, and not to its out-of-state counterpart, the state was effectively providing a benefit to in-state business and a burden on out-of-state business that constituted the functional equivalent of a tariff, and the court struck it down. now 
well, that 
well, it isn't quite like official that, i hope, justice breyer. i mean, notice defects are very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know how to look for prejudice. they know how to say whether the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his defense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or another. and that's a very common case by case sort of prejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the violation.
you are absolutely right, your honor, and i don't think this court should lose sight of the bright line importance of the prima paint rule. but in a sense, prima paint again is a rule of federal law. the court in that case specifically affirmed the federal law approach taken by the first circuit as opposed to the state law approach, which i think was a little bit like your honor's hypothetical, the chief justice's hypothetical.
on the basis solely of the testimony of  of this expert.
yes, i  yes, i think it  i think it would. the question here, though, is where congress has thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation of a federal statute and created a judicial cause of action for every wrong that's  that  that can exist under that statute, then the incidents and features of that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case are different. and attorney's fees is just the best example of that. if  under respondent's view  when congress was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of this court's decisions that have repeatedly said that attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly provided for. and indeed, elsewhere in the communications act 
i think in terms of harmless error, that would be our second position, but the first position here is that a constitutional violation has not been established.
the penalty phase took about a day with eight witnesses.
why the purpose.
yes. they give an explanation.
no, your honor.
your honor, in the federal circuit, each party had the  had the ability to put any part of the record, or the entire record, before the court, and, under the federal circuit's own rule, they were also entitled to go back to the district court record, whether it was in the appendix or not. so, the entire record 
so you're distinguishing between a state judgment and an application upon which further, further proceedings can be had. why is that a nondistinction?
that is 
i think your concern should be, what did congress intend? and 
all right, let me take you through both parts. telecommunications  we're going to talk about the definition of "telecommunications" and what it is to "offer." they are wrong in suggesting that there is not telecommunications here, and i can prove it two ways. the first is, remember, "telecommunications" is the phrase in the definition of "information service," as well. let me take you back to it.
i think we can look at any dictionary. i don't have a cite, your honor, but 
doesn't that objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?
hurtz. yes.
i think it does, your honor.
but mr. chief justice, the point of having congress enact these removal provisions and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to vindicate those rights and interests. if powerex were sued for not 
are you talking about a claim mover? i'm not 
yes.
i think that you would require a much clearer statement before accepting that kind of procedural innovation. i see my time has expired.
well, but it's at the bottom of page 187. we're on this same point. given these circumstances 
i think that this court could engage in that. i think you could remand and have the florida supreme court engage in that.
right.
and 
with respect to the regulations, but 
oh, that's 1983.
the statute and this court's precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill, what degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter in respect to an objectively defined problem, objective looking at the claim and looking at the prior art? what the federal circuit is talking about now is an inquiry into motivation, not skill. those two are very different concepts. there is not a word in this court's precedents that says that whether a patent should be granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows he could do.
well, no. the  the other distinction  and  and i'm not sure if this goes to your point or not. the other distinction is that in armstrong the claim was made in the criminal prosecution itself. here, the claim is the civil action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and it's in that  in that context especially that the analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why the element of  that the person has to  that the  there has to have been a favorable termination for the  for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.
i think it provides a close analogy. it is not  it is not a perfect fit, no, your honor. but it does  but the court very carefully directed parties and courts to look to title vii for understanding of the operation of the proof rules.
and you would take  you would make the assumption, apparently, that on that occasion the elements, the factual basis for the plea would have been disclosed. but unfortunately, the record has been destroyed.
in palliative care? and you think in some states you can  you can prescribe these drugs without violating the act; whereas, in other states, the same prescription would violate the act.
 telling that, if you go back to the government's brief in yeskey, when we were dealing with constitutional challenges to the application of title ii to prisons, the government focused all its energy on defending it as valid section 5 legislation 
not disputed that these are goods of like grade and quality, your honor.
yes.
you think he could.
mr. chief justice, in grutter you said specifically that individualized review was required in the context of university admissions. in this context, the kind of review, the specific kind of review that i understand the united states to urge and the petitioner to urge, serves no purpose, and it may itself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools where everyone gets a seat.
i mean, it's inconceivable that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision.
well, i  i'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, your honor 
why doesn't the choice of counsel protect autonomy too?
right. i 
well, i mean, specifically what congress found in that finding was that none of them provided it as part of a curriculum. and i think what the record here clearly reflects  you know, i don't know that the idea of a curriculum  i don't know exactly what congress had in mind. but clearly, is a matter of sort of what you teach residents 
because, with respect, that's not what congress said in 1996.
i thought so, in shrink missouri.
what does the trustee do? he's not really a trustee under 13, is he?
but on any timetable?
yes, your honor.
no, and in fact, the case that's cited against us for that proposition, the freeport mcmoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited by exxon mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity context. and it's not  it  it does not have its genesis in statute, but it's in policy. we don't want to keep people from moving across state lines. we don't want to  want to impede their  their free movement. so we're going to look at it at the time of filing. but what we have here is a case where maybe it was original jurisdiction when the case was filed, but it's not original anymore.
and so, the convictions are affirmed. the jury is going to be instructed, "the defendant stands convicted, has been found convicted beyond a reasonable doubt." it is to decide these four questions: did he act deliberately? does he constitute a future danger? and, to the extent the government puts on evidence that addresses those concerns, we believe we have the right to respond to that. and also  we also have to remember that the  that the alibi in this case was  really was offered as impeachment of the codefendants. the codefendants are really the only evidence that links the defendant to these crimes. and so, to the extent that  it's impeachment by contradiction. so, while they may find that if the codefendants say, "he did a, b, and c," and mom says, "no, he was with me," it doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only that they should disbelieve the codefendants. and that is a  although it seems incongruous, that's standard impeachment by contradiction. the jury is given an instruction that they're to consider it for the limited purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants, but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi. and that happens in trials every day. so, we don't think it's that unusual for the  if the evidence relates to the sentencing questions the jury must consider, then it should come in. so, the other point that i think is important in this case is that the  you know, the  it's really not unlike this  cases that this court has held, sumner versus shuman, and skipper. if the government puts on evidence  i see my time is up.
what does that mean, if you're tried for illegal entry and the government doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict of attempt?
no. equal protection mandates relief in this case, and aedpa does not prevent it. i respectfully request that the court affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit. thank you.
now you skipped over "actual place," there 
 as to what congress 
all the way at the end of 4, okay.
 then the time runs from the date on which it was initially recognized. in other words 
i'm not aware of any case, justice kennedy, where an express finding of bad faith is placed on the record. but  but, of course, that points out one of the  one of the things about this kind of case is that we just have a record in many ways. what the united states is suggesting is that we should have these satellite collateral proceedings where we have to not just investigate questions like that perhaps, but also recreate an entire trial. and this is much more difficult than the strickland scenario because, as justice alito pointed out, in strickland we can at least compare the defendant  the defendant's lawyer's performance against an objective  an objective counsel. and even  and it's even easier than that because, because of the performance prong, the first prong of the strickland test, we winnow out the decisions that lawyer made to probably just two or three. i mean, in this court's typical strickland case, it looks at one or two decisions a trial judge  the trial counsel made. in this context, we'd have to look not just at an entire trial, but at the entire attorney-client relationship from the moment the  the counsel would have met the defendant, all of the different decisions that might have taken place in terms of investigation, negotiation, strategy before trial, strategy during trial. and what you'd be asking is for this first-choice counsel presumably to take the stand or file some sort of affidavit not saying this is the strategy that would have  would have necessarily happened because he didn't get to try the case. what  what you'd be asking this person to do is sort of take the stand and hypothesize what he might have done in all these various situations 
i  i've also gotten that impression. but  but heck i think teaches an important  heck teaches an important lesson for this case as well, which is that heck was just a suit for money damages, just like this suit. and  and yet, this court said that there's going to be no cause of action under section 1983 because of the intersection of 1983 and habeas. well, we have the same result here. there should be no federal court case here because of the intersection of section 1257 
 it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply.
thank you.
what is the precise language that you think relinquished, changed the sovereignty that  changed the sovereignty?
 that elsewhere they go out of their way to add and  and expenses? it seems to me that hurts your case.
well, it would also prevent the candidate himself from expending his entire fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he should be elected 
not generally. statute of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c) affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for the party to waive or not, just like the statute of limitations. i don't think there's any rule that says a judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has raised it.
the result of that is it was determined that these actions by these line officers of the bureau of land management were perfectly appropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has systematically violated the permits and conditions that are found 
i would think that's 
here, i think if you ran 
well, i still question whether 
well, it's clear from the statute that, that what you would do would be leave them subject to the opt-in determination, but all other funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.
well, i believe that you have  you would have to  i mean, would it be efficacious with vitamin a? i don't know, but if it  if it requires a change in the label, it has to be done by epa because the manufacturer commits a federal law violation if it sells the product with any different label. if you  if i can just direct the court's attention to 
when you say it's a nullity, what you really mean is it allows for very  very little relief.
your  your complaint is that equilon is in reality a joint venture of  of the two  the two gasoline companies.
but that question was not put to the jury, right?
well, of 
mr. kneedler, the defendant here is not the prosecutor. right?
that's the misrepresentation.
do you agree 
what i'm saying with respect to a policy is if you have an ongoing policy that is still being applied in the limitations period, and that your current policy is to pay less to women than to men, then of course you can sue.
and that even when it's unambiguous, that's the end of the matter.
your honor, that was an accurate description of the state of the law, as it existed at the time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter, respondents have not been able to point to a single reported case a  of a holder class action in state court prior to the adoption of the uniform standards act. so, while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such claims could be brought under the law of some states, there are  there is no history of state class actions in this area, which is one of the reasons why we think the reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense here. securities class actions prior to the pslra were brought in federal court, and it was only the pslra that resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here, being brought in state courts. and congress  once it saw that problem, congress was concerned that the requirements of the pslra were being evaded, and it was also concerned, as the conference committee report makes clear, that, now that these securities class actions were being brought in state court, there was the potential danger of 50 varying state standards being applied, as this very case suggests, and congress acted to remedy both of those problems, as the conference committee report makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk of evasion of the pslra. respondent's position would frustrate both of those objectives, because it would  it would permit the most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in state court, and it would permit such holder claims to be brought  for instance, based on negligence, if state law permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected by the federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements under the pslra. so, the pslra protections would be frustrated by their interpretation. so, the very goals that congress explicitly sought to achieve, stated in the  in the text of the statute, in the purposes section and also in the conference committee report, would be frustrated. and, again, that approach requires the court to accept an inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in the legislative history that provides even a hint of a suggestion that congress would have intended that result. and with respect to blue chip, your honor, it's important to remember what blue chip was doing. blue chip was not a case about the scope of the "in connection with" requirement or the section 10(b) prohibition. instead, it was a case about what to infer about what congress would have wanted to authorize as an  as a right of action, if it had addressed the question. and that's why the blue chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there involving injuries to holders can be a violation of section 10(b)  i.e., it can be in connection with the purchase or sale of securities  it's just that they did not think that congress would have wanted to authorize a private right of action. so, again, when we're talking about the scope of the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at issue here, that approach is the same approach that should be followed here, the same approach that was in  followed in o'hagan and in zandford, and compels the conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is unquestionably "in connection with the purchase and sale of securities," as this court has construed that phrase, it is preempted by the uniform standards act. if the court has no further questions, i thank the court.
yes.
 would grant you a retrial.
we are not asking the court to set a 17 constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must 18 obtain records in every capital case. we are asking this 19 court to apply the rule articulated in strickland v. 20 washington itself where the court indicated that counsel 21 has a duty to make a reasonable investigation.
i'm not sure exactly where it is in the appendix, your honor. let me see. i  i don't know that we do. i know we have reference to it, but i don't know that we have the actual language.
oh, i'm sorry. i didn't realize you were still operating 
the 
no. i would agree. in fact, congress has the final say-so, and then this court has got to look at what congress says to interpret it. and congress said, i say very simply, that they're deemed a citizen of any state wherever they are located.
that's true, but in that case, in that case they didn't have a state supreme court interpreting the statute which is just as you started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the rights of the nonmember, zero. it has to do with the appearance of fairness in the election.
treaty.
right. smith held the foreign country exception applied even though the employee would  the  the plaintiff would have no remedy.
right.
well, it's very unlikely if it's a party that is  gets the small vote that this party gets. but you  no matter how small the vote is, you still find the injury to the major parties because they voted for the libertarians or because they didn't vote at all?
why isn't  i mean, what's  what's the answer?
yes, they do. and, again, this is the situation contemplated in colville. it's analogous to what this court said in cabazon with respect to the gambling facility, where the tribe has introduced on-reservation value. and in colville, the court contemplated if the tribe puts a service station and sells to people who would be there anyway, that is on-reservation value; they are not simply marketing a tax exemption and drawing people in by virtue of a tax exemption. but, beyond that, just because  if the court concludes that the incidence of the tax is on the distributor, notwithstanding the kansas supreme court's decision, the subject matter of the tax, the "what is being taxed," is the sale or distribution, and that is a sale between the distributor and the retailer. that is clearly 
 authority.
that doesn't say he can see it  they can see it?
that's what he's arguing, and those are not screening mechanisms, your honor. probable cause was evident and was present in united states against armstrong and wayte against the united states. it was not deemed by this court to be a bar to the selective prosecution claims that were advanced in that  in those cases.
in any case, it's clear that that  that that entity no longer has standing, isn't it?
and it is in effect to bring students together in a mix that is not too far from their community. i see that my time has expired. thank you.
 but a more fundamental principle that one country usually does not legislate with respect to extraterritorial acts.
thank you.
what is  what is sacrosanct about the  about the constitutional right not to be subjected to racial stereotype? there are a lot of other constitutional rights that people in prison give up. that's one of the consequences of committing a crime and being sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional right, the right to  to walk around and  and not be seized. why  why is it that this  this one constitutional right cannot yield to what prison authorities believe is  is a useful, not necessarily essential, but a useful means of  of maintaining order in prison?
they could have said it that way, but it seems to me quite clear that congress still intended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari materia. and  and again, you  you still run into the same problem, justice scalia, as to why is it that congress would want to protect more thoroughly 704 plaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs. and it seems to me there's no 
oh, of course, i know.
am i asking 
doesn't that seem like a fine line? i mean, if you're sitting around with your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under this provision, planning a burglary. but if you actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder, that somehow involves less of a potential risk of physical injury?
that's true because i think that the magistrate is making the common sense judgment that this will be  we don't know exactly when 
what about our opinion in ramirez, where the manner of entry was such that there was damage to property?
okay.
the  the model penal code takes the position that every defense, affirmative defense, goes on the government, and that's just a policy judgment 
but, of course, the reason you import it is because it contains this particular substance. [laughter.]
certainly.
oh, okay. no. i agree with you. if in fact you think that there's a problem about a real indigent bringing a claim in michigan, although we have two on the docket, if i accepted that premise, i would begin to think you were right. so then what i was trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to whether i accept that premise. and of course, that's what's everybody has been talking about, and i do see at the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can bring it themselves, and indeed they have.
you  you were there for the purpose of getting him booted out. i mean, you didn't  you didn't get into the merits of anything.
i'm sorry.
well, but as a matter of policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some later case, may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable. if it is, we may be  not be talking about much. it's just going to be boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end of it. and it 
i  i think it is not, your honor.
so the  there  there was jurisdiction in the federal court to entertain the removed case.
and that has a lot of implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that has nothing to do, i think, with unions.
well, i think 
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the united states submits that the right to a patent is an important matter, but it must be considered in the context of the remedies as well. and the united states further submits the patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by the familiar four-factor test this court has applied in cases such as weinberger v. romero-barcelo. this court's express endorsement of the four-factor test would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent should issue in any particular case. the court of appeals in this case did not make express reference to the four-factor test. nevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the  the district court's decisions.
yes, but that's because the joint venture did not include  did not include a merging of the product as it did here. here, the gasoline from both of them was merged into one gasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was divided between them. in  in citizens publishing, each of the newspapers continued to sell its own newspaper and to  and to reap whatever profit it could make from its own newspaper. that's fundamentally different from here. there  there still is competition between the two newspapers.
so if the prosecution had not opened the door, that would have been improper? you overrule  the judge said counsel, you can't argue about sending a message for life?
 my point is not that congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue of treating that requirement as jurisdictional. my point simply is that if we are in  in a situation in which it is not clear whether it's jurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in effect, up front effectively through summary judgment, and in the alternative, can be treated  and  as  as an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative, can be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a jurisdictional element. the fact that it can be treated effectively up front is one reason to think that congress would probably have wanted that fact issue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as elemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and the parties are not going to go through entire trials only to have the whole thing upset by a belated jurisdictional argument. that's my only point.
so you  and the reason it wouldn't matter on your view is that the component is the object code on the disk, not the disk itself?
say negative things 
as explained in the cert petition papers, the case is on appeal in the state court system on objections to the settlement, and it will not be mooted during the course of this court's action on the case. but the invocation of jury that would be done normally just before trial has not been an issue that's been presented.
i believe that there are countries in europe who abolish it because of their membership in the european union 
let's assume that that's true in most of the states.
all right. you agree that the union could segregate these funds as opposed to commingling them, and that would cure, that would in effect answer your, your constitutional objection?
i  i believe that would  could be and  and should be a factor in a district court's consideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, your honor. the state has expressed concerns about delay. there are four reasons why those concerns are overstated. first, in the 3 and a half years since duncan v. walker was decided, there have been cases in circuit courts of appeals that have approved of the stay and abeyance procedure. none of those cases evidence that it is being misused or is causing undue delay. second, the terms of the stay themselves can restrict a petitioner's delay, as i've already recounted the  the district court did here. third, this court in slack v. mcdaniel addressed very similar arguments to what the state is making now about delay through a second habeas filing. and this  this court noted that the rules of civil procedure vest courts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed litigation and that there are other reasons why those concerns expressed in slack v. mcdaniel were  were overwrought. fourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as already mentioned in answer to one of justice scalia's questions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under a capital sentence. it is not hyperbole to say that 99.4 percent of federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not serving  are not under a capital penalty. those are statistics from the year 2000 from the department of justice. and those, i think with the extremely rare exception, are people who believe rightly or wrongly that they're in prison because their constitutional rights have been violated and would not favor delay under any circumstance. so the delay concern that the state raises is  is overwrought. unless there are other questions, i'd reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.
 what do you make of 
so you're saying if the original establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the state of new york and that the indian title was a purely aboriginal title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating a reservation, that it cannot be indian country, is that correct?
 and the only judge 
 morrissey against brewer, and gagnon 
yes, your honor, with respect to certain types of units, electric generating units like those at issue in this case, that's correct. they would not be identical under the proposal, but would be similar.
well, do you think the waiver argument that's made is properly before us?
correct.
no, sir. i'm saying the application under 3850 in florida state trial courts, which then goes to the florida state supreme court, is the application upon which this court would be acting. if it were not acting on that, what would it be acting on?
the 
well, i think more likely than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent. can you tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more likely than not?
well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and  and people who have money cannot. i mean, that's  that's not a fair rule either.
arising 
i mean, i am not going to try  but, again, this court  the  the courts below did say that that exigent circumstances didn't rise to the level 
 i agree with you.
well, the statute was enacted in 1984 when software was certainly present. it's fair to say that congress was not thinking of software, but that's further caution for not expanding the statute beyond traditional territorial reaches. because first, this court has cautioned, has said that it should be cautious in applying existing electrical property statutes to new technologies. and in addition it's emphasized in deepsouth that the caution against extraterritoriality applies in this very context. so congress is writing against the backdrop of normal territorial principles, which are the making, using or selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to foreign law, and against the backdrop of deepsouth, which has specifically held that congress has to speak clearly to enact of statute like this.
 a simple, modest point that 
well, i think the plaintiff could argue that, "that's not my core job duties. my job duties is to"  if it's a prosecutor, "is to make statements" 
it  it is the same percentage that the total medicals bore to what we agreed was a fair valuation of the claim or what we agreed there would be evidence to support.
ms. brinkmann, congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the order  there's no automatic dismissal of the case when congress passes an act. there is a case lodged in the court, and that court will follow congress's directions and dismiss it. but until it does, its hold final judgment. the judgment of the guam supreme court is suspended while it's sub judicata before the ninth circuit, and then when the ninth circuit acts, then there is a trigger. but until there isn't.
what's the answer to justice alito's question in this case?
and  and you say, well, since we don't have an answer, we have to take the course that's going to get this guy executed. that doesn't seem to me to make much sense.
but  and that is why it's important, and it goes back to justice breyer's question, if i can go back to that for a second, because he asked about the d.c. circuit's opinion, which, you know, of course, adopted the eeoc's now-discredited theory of this case and, again, untethers 703 from 704. that's the problem with the d.c. circuit's interpretation.
it came in under a nevada statute which was patterned after roberts. it came in under a nevada statute 
i'm not arguing that he did. my assumption, though, is if he had the statute before him, he probably had this. the president 
and laddering, for example?
perhaps that is true, your honor, but i still believe that that is this case, that there really is no different  i mean, in casey, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge before the law took effect to the adequate  challenging the adequacy of a medical emergency exception. and this court indicated that if the law prohibited an immediate abortion for women with the conditions dr. goldner described in his declaration here, it would have been unconstitutional and some relief would have been appropriate, even though that was a facial challenge and even though the alleged inadequacies of the medical emergency would harm relatively few women. so i don't think that there is any bar to this court if they 
it is  the burden-of-proof failure that the fourth circuit found was that we could not 
just someone who provided information to the prosecutor that  that was erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.
well, but my hypothetical is designed to suggest that partisanship, political lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court for abuse of discretion in  in overemphasizing political considerations. and then if that's true, it means that there is some standard lurking out there indicating that political considerations should be of at least secondary importance.
are people really not allowed to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?
i'm not sure why you concede that. i mean, i looked at the case and it seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of wax. and i suspect my reaction to that tape was in part affected by the fact that he went through the shopping center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is what scott saw.
i  i don't know whether it's a correct impression or not. our brief points the court to an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have  have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or fewer facilities. and one thing we know for sure is that when congress enacted the telecom act of 1996, it specifically wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies. it had specific provisions in the law to give special treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster diversity and competition. but in the event that you 
no, we did not.
i don't recall, your honor, whether or not the word employer was used. i think it was clearly stated that  and  and there's no doubt ms. arbaugh was, in fact, employed by y & h.
well, what we have to look at is whether, first, the state, under roth, intended to create a property interest rather than just giving mandatory direction to its officers. and i think the critical question there is what the default rule ought to be on a statute that is not clear on that question. and i think roth tells us that for purposes of federal constitutional law, the default cannot be that we assume the state created a property interest, at least in this kind of nontraditional property interest. and i think it's important to focus on what kind of property interest we're talking about.
or did i misunderstand your 
wel, were they  were they 13 hired to  to look into alcoholism?
i don't even think we mentioned them. did we mention them?
there  well, under article iii and under section 1257(a), there has to be a case or controversy for this court to review. there was no live case or controversy in the kansas supreme court on the federal question of whether the equipoise provision in the kansas statute was constitutional. it was conceded that it was unconstitutional and the parties agreed on that. it was treated as settled. and all the kansas supreme court did, before overruling the kleypas severability decision, which is a matter of state law, was to reiterate that holding, and mere reiteration, as this court knows from the morrison v. watson case, approved in illinois v. gates, that is not the decision of a federal question.
 even after the 17th day, the federal court could hear a  have a factual hearing.
even though the law required him to be there?
yes. so if there's any way of  of execution that is totally painless, that  that must be pursued.
but when i ask 
they were saying that first-tier felony appeals in michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like late appeals from trial cases do. but all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes. and the sixth circuit specifically dealt with that in  in the abela case. mckenzie v. smith never  never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented. the resource allocations point is simply that not all of these guilty plea appeals are  lead to full argument and full briefing, and that's fine. michigan can do that. but what michigan cannot do, as a result of ellis and douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself. and so in  in smith v. robbins, this court, specifically referring back to the ellis case, said that the problem that the court identified in ellis and that became part of the constitutional minimum in douglas, was that the old california procedure did not require  i see my time is up. thank you, mr. chief justice.
two things about that. when he's saying it internally, he's doing his job. when he's going externally, he may be violating office policies.
 saying 
but, your honor, i'd remind you of this court's language in the vance v. universal amusement where the court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.
 i would like to know whether it is essential to its character as government speech that the government's say, "this your government speaking."
yes. i don't think i understand your honor.
one of the things that makes this tricky is that under this court's decision of city of los angeles v. lyons, if an individual is subjected to allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason to believe that it will happen to him again and damages are unavailable, then the  there is no standing to seek injunctive 
in this case, what we have under the law that exists now is that california assigned a specific role to the aggravating circumstances that included the special circumstances 
i think you're giving away too much.
and so  but the question here really is what do you do not in a case where there's been an objection, because there was no objection here.
what 
where in claim 4 do you say it's putting it together in a particular way?
that's exactly what they're saying, and what i'm saying is that is the wrong standard to be applying.
well, but it's your car, you're there. no.
well, you  you don't need a transfer of the  i don't understand what you mean 
is that universal in nevada? i mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in every case?
as a result of 
well, our submission is that it does, your honor, because we think 
mr. chief justice, that would be a better as-applied challenge. i still think that with respect to the ads in the 30 days before the primary and the 60 days before the  the general election, that corporation could look at this court's decision in mcconnell and say, oh, i understand. our remedy is not an as as-applied challenge. our remedy 
the question came up whether rule 183 forbids disclosure of this report. the answer is it does not forbid disclosure of the report. it is silent on the point. but the press release the tax court issued in 1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that this simply meant that it would not automatically be disclosed.
 there's a world of difference between this and having something put on your license plate or in your 
yes, you may reserve your 23 time.
well, is 
well, justice o'connor, i certainly do not think that there is any uniform social understanding that should drive the decision in this case, for two different reasons. first of all, i think, in many circumstances, two people who share property, and who disagree about whether a guest should be invited, will resolve it in a variety of different ways. somebody might let in a commercial visitor, over the objection of a cotenant, or someone 
and 
well, certainly there is no categorical rule that claims in the nature of claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate appeal under collateral order. in abney v. united states, for example, the court upheld immediate appeal of the denial of a  of a double jeopardy claim, which likewise depends upon the existence of a prior action.
i think that's right, justice scalia. i'm  and i'm sorry if i got us off on the wrong foot.
that's absolutely right.
 i  on that limited point, if the court applied the usual standards for the granting of a preliminary injunction, i think that the court could quite readily reverse the preliminary injunction here, because that requires a clear showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, plus that the other factors be decided. and with respect to the application of the convention, that's really a question of law. and the united states took the position before the district court in this case, that the convention applied to the tea. we think it's unquestionably a mixture, and, therefore, a preparation within the meaning of the  of the convention, and the  and the district court's injunction really puts the united states in violation of an international agreement that is critical to prohibiting trafficking 
well, mr. chief justice, i will answer it, and i  and i think actually 
i would agree, the degree of confusion, but that comes into whether or not 
yes, you could. many times in conspiracy indictments they will allege any of the official following overt acts.
 it is not a mathematical question, right? i mean, you would  it's that you would  what is the number? what's enough? 10 percent? 15 percent? presumably, there's more to it than the percentage of emissions attributable to be this particular 
well  well, yes. of course, he was proceeding pro se in the district court.
well, how can the state supreme court determine what is the purpose, the intent, of the ballot initiative?
respectfully, your honor, i think epa will have a hard time saying that there is insufficient  i mean, too much scientific uncertainty. the very sentence 
well, we  i  i contend  i can understand why you say that, but if you read the  the statute the way it's worded and you  and you look at what's going on out there, i don't see any problem with this court construing that they are a citizen of a state like south carolina where they've got 179 branches. the  according to the brief by, i think, the aba or one of the amicus, they've got something like 3,600 branches. now, they come into south carolina, they're taking  if i bank with them, they're taking my money and the  and the money of other millions of south carolinians and  who  who are entrusting their money to them, as opposed to entrust it to a state court, and if i'm banking with them, i've got to go sue them in  in federal court. whereas, if i'm banking with a 
if we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then.
i'm struggling, yes.
it  it is in the sense that it makes this the recurring scenario that congress would have been aware of when it enacted the ada in 
well, i think we're in a difficult position right now, because they're asking for proximate cause in their blue brief 
but the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure. isn't that the issue?
why doesn't he just have a trial? he says, i'm not going to contest the trial.
not under the fourth amendment. now, the  the only expert testimony in this record on that subject says there is a 7 percent chance 
oh, yes. i'm sorry.
 this is a change of the status quo. and to require the government to allow the importation of a substance that's prohibited by the convention. but if i 
 my hypothetical is that it is.
oh, not at all.
yes, your honor.
well 
if the boss makes a determination that, "this is not brady materials. i don't want disclosed," and the employee goes ahead and discloses it, our position is, that would not be protected first amendment speech.
i am suggesting that if you named the state on the wrong side of the caption on the v in federal court, it does enjoy sovereign immunity, irrespective of what your cause of action is. yes, mr. chief justice.
can i ask you another record point, just so i know where to look?
there is no indication in the record 
i mean, is that the way out of the problem?
well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue. but if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and wrongful actions taken by the government tangential to this dispute, i take it davis versus passman, broadly read, says we can use bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the government.
that's correct, your honor.
what is it? you said "extremely limited." this is the first that i heard that the tribe might have some authority over part of that, what, the 275-  the 275,000 acres, even though it hadn't repurchased the parcels.
a cure of what? that's what 
no. the source code and object code are just different computer languages for expressing the same thing. there is no  there's no difference between them. one is words and one is numbers, but they mean the same thing. there is no reason to treat them differently. the point is just that if you treat the  either the source code or the object code as the component, that's just the design of the actual physical software that goes into the computer. if you did that you'd have a vastly different statute because any physical part has a design, but the whole point of the statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the united states while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale abroad. but if the design itself was a component then you could never copy parts abroad when something was designed in the united states, because something designed abroad would always infringe because the something designed abroad would itself be the component, and that would be a vastly different statute there's no reason to think congress intended here, especially because of the extraterritorial consequences.
once the determination was made that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to the claims court, we  we would have been bound by that determination. we felt we had to bring to a final resolution the  the intended beneficiary issue before we could proceed in the claims court either.
i'm still not sure why, if we think that there is merit to your argument that the tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you  we have to reach the conspiracy charge.
okay, i 
mr. miller, suppose congress set up a entirely separate cause of action. it's caused  it's called a discovery cause of action, okay? and it sets forth as the condition for pursuing that cause of action a standard that your, your allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing. okay? and then if you win that, you can take whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a lawsuit. would that be unconstitutional?
well, your honor, that would certainly seem to be viewpoint discrimination, and it would implicate 
that's 
these are patent portfolios 
that's correct, your honor.
thank you, justice stevens, and may it please the court: my client and i are asking the court to rule that the assignment of income doctrine does not apply when unrelated persons combine their resources to jointly generate income. and we 
thank you.
yes.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the evidence presented in the district court fails to raise sufficient doubt about mr. house's guilt to justify review of his procedurally defaulted claims because reasonable jurors would not ignore the fact that mr. house's jeans were stained with the blood of carolyn muncey. that is a fact that has not been undermined by any of the evidence presented in the federal habeas proceeding. the enzymatic degradation theory of dr. blake was so thoroughly discredited in the federal evidentiary hearing that it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror, viewing all the evidence, would be convinced by it, let alone that everyone would vote to acquit in light of it. in fact, the petitioner's evidence of innocence was disputed in nearly every respect and sorely 
 from the past.
no.
the fda is concerned with safety in animals. and there may be some cases in which there is a known safety risk to a drug, and there will be a heightened look at potential benefits in order to balance that out. but the regulations focus on safety. and in this particular case 
what's your second-best analog? [laughter.]
well, i'm happy to move to that as well, but before that, i mean, it is  there can be concurrent causes and there can be objective concurrent causes. and the defendant could not have been tried during the relevant time period, and therefore, objectively speaking, that was  i mean, if the  if the court had tried to try him 
and there had been an argument raised in the appellate court 
and now it wants to get back its benefits in full.
thank you, i'll try to speak quickly. i just have a couple of points. one is with regard to the spread of national banks. there is a comparable spread of state banks. for instance, sun trust is a bank that's comparable in scope to wachovia. it has operations in many states. it has many branches, i assume, in south carolina. and yet, it is a citizen only of its home state, its state of incorporation, or principal place of business. if there were a problem of abuse of relocation, which i think the court was a little bit worried about, congress would deal with it the way they dealt with the abuses of corporate  stated place of incorporation by passing 1332(c). so let me 
that's correct.
 that is not equally magic about a partnership or a corporation?
 health and safety.
i mean, if he has other  he says, "i have other witnesses that go to the residual-doubt question," and i would  you know, on retrial, if he prevails here, presumably he would be entitled to put in that evidence, as well.
well, i think in some, in some cases that, pay cases, it will build up over time. in some cases it will happen immediately. but in either case, what title vii says is that you have 180 days to challenge a discrete pay decision. if you do not do that, you cannot come back later, years later, four years later, six years later, or here at the end of her career, and challenge every pay decision that's been made up until then on the grounds that intent, it was intentionally discriminatory and continues to have ongoing effects.
are you able to answer my question yes or no?
and the reason, justice ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on vessels that go to other ports.
no, it wasn't. and it's not part of this lawsuit, because there's no dispute that the communication at issue in this case is that disposition memorandum that he prepared purely pursuant to his prosecutorial duties.
well, assuming 
 price the 
yes. i  i think, obviously, the court has an obligation to satisfy itself of the jurisdiction. but i'll point out then that you would have had that obligation as well in nteu against von raab in which this court addressed precisely the same kind of case, litigated in precisely the same posture.
 in this litigation.
maybe that's hard to justify in terms of california's statute, but we take the california supreme court's interpretation of that statute as the law of california. so what is the answer to my question as you read black?
your honor, it's congress that set the line at scope of employment.
that is correct, justice ginsburg. what makes this particular so 
we haven't argued that it is generic burglary. that's correct.
yes.
generally it happens during the arrest process. if  if, during the course of questioning, they determine that a detainee or arrestee is a foreign national, then at that point in time, generally they would provide consular notification. the state 
 the question.
yes. so, why do you insist that they be adjudicated?
it's a parallel  it's based on mcdonnell douglas in the sense that  that there's a parallel step of prima facie case, shifting the burden of production. the defendant or respondent comes up with an answer, and then eventually the trier of fact decides whether or not the  the plaintiff or the moving party has been persuasive.
thank you, your honor. justice o'connor, i do know that the  that wiretap statutes came about only after three important decisions from this court: ker v. california, katz, and berger. and in  in those opinions, they dealt  they dealt very strongly with the particularity clause of the fourth amendment and wiretap restrictions. thereafter, there were extensive congressional hearings on wiretaps and the final result was a very carefully drafted statute that allowed for wiretap, subject to  to very stringent conditions, specifically enumerated  enumerated crimes and specific circumstances, but additionally, notice to the homeowner 
if the federal government were running this program itself, would you make the same argument?
 and  and it's based on the government's waiver of sovereign immunity for nonmonetary claims.
i think 
but that's not what i was speaking of just momentarily. the rights of the injured employees, the workers, when they filed for  when pg&e filed for bankruptcy, the injured workers had claims. they were going to receive periodic benefit payments off into the future. if pg&e had not properly provided for those claims in the bankruptcy case in their plan, those claims would have been extinguished. as a result, though, travelers would not have been off the hook on its surety bond, travelers would have had to have stepped forward and make the payments if pg&e did not. but if travelers hadn't come to the bankruptcy court and said, these are our rights, these need to be preserved, its recourse against pg&e would have extinguished as well. if one does not come to the bankruptcy court and assert one's rights, one loses them. and of course, creditors when they do have to assert their rights, incur attorneys' fees for doing so. and here we had a pre-petition contract that said, whatever loss we incur, including attorneys' fees, we have a right to recover, a right to payment. that becomes the claim.
why not? you say it's a federal question.
what i'm thinking of is a statute. the statute has fairly close detail as to what the contracts must contain. it gives authority to omb or  to write regs. and they have written regs that have very detailed provisions as to what the contracts must contain, and then there is the contract with the individual carried  when the  when the carrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and statutes.
that was a 
state and  than state and local governments? i hope not. but here's  here's the additional 
you mean the burden of persuasion.
is it moral culpability for you to take as an example for your behavior the criminal population?
oh. well, what i'm trying to say is because the child lacks capacity, they can't do all these things on their own until they reach majority. but once they do and the rights transfer, it illustrates that it's not really the parents' rights, it is the child's right that they are protecting.
 and 
that  that's exactly right, your honor.
what is the  what is the data-processing part?
it is not in the appendix itself, no. the resolution is not in there. the citation to it from the index is there.
the problem  i'd be repeating it. we're not talking about, say, your case. i don't know what your evidence is. but let's imagine a case where the evidence of just what you said consists of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be characterized in a variety of ways, including the way the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who would repeat the very words you just said. now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge to say whether that's so? i know you do. or do you want the sec to say whether that's so in the particular case? or that's why i thought of primary jurisdiction: maybe first send it to the sec. what's your view?
one could characterize those episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine. i mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street. so the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.
and  and so are we somehow required to at least look at that? i mean, the statistics of how many states have approved 18 years as the line is about the same as those in the retardation case.
mr. salmons, can i ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation. am i correct in believing that there's a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation, so that what we're really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case?
there are a few things, presumably very localized activities that the state would have the exclusive authority in. importantly though, the federal government, even though the state owns title here, will retain all of its constitutional authority under the interstate commerce clause to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce that 
well, and you asked that question. i mean, i think it might be useful to think first about national banks and then about the operating subsidiaries. it is not true that there are no state laws that apply to national banks. this court's unanimous barnett bank decision is the clearest statement of the principle. any state laws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the exercise of national banking powers are preempted. but many state laws having to do with contracts 
what if it were the highest cost producer? suppose still, they think that by buying these logs we later can make a profit when we resell them on the competitive market. you see, the reason they're coming up with this test is they don't think you can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think that you can produce a better one. so i'm listening.
well, i think the instruction said 
will you assume justice stevens' hypothetical? assume it, take it as given. they did put that in. i know you think they didn't, but i want to assume it.
 looking to florida 
i'd like to ask you one other question. suppose you win on this on the grounds we've been discussing. what happens in the middle of the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?
why  why was there federal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?
well, that's not  that's not true at all. i mean, if  if the  the witness may be a good witness and compelling on the stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in person. this is only addressed to the situations where the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.
well, again, it is our position that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the administrative proceedings, so long as they have exhausted their claims. and that this is confirmed in other provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as a possible prevailing party.
unless they make the exact kind of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same statute that was at issue in blakely itself.
yes.
use them for  he did use them 21 for aggravation.
okay.
thank you.
how does he differ  how does he differ from the renter in sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to african americans? he wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. and this court said he could maintain that suit.
so your  your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?
actually justice souter's approach might work here because you  you  all the second habeases file immediately. now, the seventh circuit, you say, well, gets to those second habeases right away, and it says dismissed. very well. when they say dismissed, then they ask for cert. and when they ask for cert, we take or we don't. if we don't, then they're out of luck. and if we take it, people would hold all the other cases waiting to see what we decide. so they wouldn't lose out in any case where we really were going to make it collaterally  applicable on collateral review.
of course, they could have come up here, though. i mean, maybe that was their mistake in not making their federal claim in the california court. the california court would have denied their state claim, presumably denied their federal claim, and  and both could have come up here i suppose. or  or would the california's  would california's determination of the state questions preclude a separate determination of the federal questions?
but that  that 
right.
 turns on whether some workers are independent contractors or employees. and for agency law purposes, which becomes relevant in tort law in terms of vicarious liability, the question whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor is a  is a longstanding jury question.
i think 
and i don't think you could have gotten where you want to go with the instruction that your side requested, which was an in whole or in part instruction. that's my only point.
ah, but the plaintiff said, "this is a complicated real estate business, and i want to discover whether there is  whether the 'true defendant' is a virginia citizen, as i am." so, on the face of it, it looks like there's complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse defendant is hiding the "real party." i think that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.
well, i  i'm not familiar with that case.
well, it doesn't present any question of law, just a question of fact. let's say both parties agree about the law, but the fact that is determinative of nothing, except the operation of federal law, is at issue. now, that  that would normally  under 1331, you'd be able to come into federal court i suppose just where your only dispute is a factual dispute, but it is a factual dispute regarding the operation of federal law. what  what if this were just a factual dispute about the operation of federal law? what would we do with it? does the fact that it's a factual dispute make it not substantial, not a substantial federal question?
that's my understanding, as well, justice ginsburg. and the pursuit of this prosecution by the united states reflects that when united states citizens engage in fraudulent conduct on our soil, our government has a distinct interest, from canada's interest, in pursuing the prosecution of this case.
that is exactly our position.
your honor 
sure.
we don't know. the legislative record is entirely silent. but one plausible inference could be, could be reached based on looking at the addition of attorney's fees provision and the timing of the maroni decision in the first circuit. maroni came down after the parental lay representation provision was proposed by the senate. maroni was the first court of appeals case to recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro se. the way maroni did it however was by adopting our primary argument here today, which is that parents possess the right to  to sue in their own name, as pro se litigants, not as lay representatives of their children, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights. congress very well could have looked at maroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along; maroni got it right, and then they just put  congress just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that parents can be, or are the prevailing party if the plaintiffs prevail in an idea action. finally, i would like to address two  two points about the spending clause. of course we believe the spending clause is totally inapplicable, but i want to respond to respondent's suggest that we're advocating creation of a new substantive right here.
as a practical matter. and  and there  there 
i'm not sure you've answered my question. would it have been a constitutional addition to that instruction to say, "but i want to  you to clearly understand that it is not to be considered mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime"? would that have been permissible?
you mean 
but then you  you have to 8 concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any 9 due diligence requirement because on your reading of the 10 statute, there isn't  there isn't any such requirement.
i 
no. the jury instruction left out the word "corruptly," as far as i can see, in the part that was critical. they define "corruptly" as simply an intent to impede. and the word "impede" goes well beyond what i've said, both because it does not cover the three things, but, most particularly, because it does not say that it was dishonest or that the person who did the persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the investigation would have the legal right to get the material and there was no right to withhold it. the words that arthur andersen suggested, while they don't say precisely that, were at least a step in the right direction.
 you are defending a judgment that no court in maryland, as far as i know, ever made. all of the courts thought that the law was, yes, the taint of an improper question by the police can be removed.
so who 
and they also know what "assault" means. and if you tried, you could spell out "assault." they know what "robbery" means, but you could spell it out. so why does the ninth circuit think this one you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't have to?
again, the statute doesn't require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud. it requires direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based.
now does, but not at common law.
but both of those examples, of course, are quantities, and once you  i think it was holmes who said, once you admit the necessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always find something on one side or the other. it's quite different between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75 feet and advocacy with respect to an election and advocacy with respect to an issue. it's an entirely different quality of a distinction, it seems to me.
under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in john martin reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year. so it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year. it would not constitute a  a credit, but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions. so there would be no carryover in compact accounting.
in one  in one plaintiff's case, i think, there isn't a life-threatening 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: john stumpf pleaded guilty to the aggravated murder of mary jane stout. the evidence shows he is, in fact, guilty of that crime. the court below, nonetheless, vacated his conviction on habeas review citing two grounds. its reasoning on each directly conflicts with this court's opinions and significantly undermines the finality of the hundreds of thousands of state court criminal convictions based on pleas.
do you think the school board in that case would use the clumsy means of racial integrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more money to the black schools?
suppose he did  he hasn't violated the statute of limitations. he  he filed it before a year ran from the time that we finally recognized it because we haven't even recognized it yet.
okay.
sure.
mr. 
but i think there is a big difference. i mean 
 or from shipping to consumers from out of state without paying you their tax?
they are elected.
these  these 
so, we're just debating now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of the good samaritan statute.
it'll get the  it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.
well, that may be, but the issue here is whether the ninth circuit simply went too far in the other direction and required too much. and all we have to determine is whether there is a per se obligation to prove non-confusion. if we do so, that doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's position, it simply says that the ninth circuit went too far, isn't that correct? i mean, that is what is  that is the issue before us?
we prescribe federal jurisdiction. i  you know, i'm not a fan of legislative history, but i  i don't find that particular piece very much against you. in fact, it may be just  just the opposite. it may be  it's lawyers' language, you know. we don't know whether there's federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make a better case for  you know, for the other side.
but you do agree if it were in equipoise the state would have the burden?
the dog is entitled to one bite.
 the messages in its pro-beef ads. it  justice souter, the government could do that, but it's not hiding from this message. we think that if the court 
no, justice scalia, but he was not charged with a premeditated murder.
no, you take the position, then, that  going to the earlier hypothetical that somebody brought up, that, say, in a brady case, if the  if the federal prosecutor believes there was brady material that  and let's assume he's correct, just to make it a simple case  that there's brady material to be turned over, and the u.s. attorney says, "do not turn the brady material over," that if the  if the u.s.  if the  if the prosecutor tells this to a court, that he can be disciplined?
i'm helping you.
no, but the argument  it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the federal case, after losing the state case, you in effect are asking the federal court in some sense to review what happened in the state court. justice ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer. is that your answer?
or am i wrong? or am i wrong about that? the judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?
and 
i'm still, i'm still puzzled about my question. suppose there's a battery resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.
i'm trying to produce ridiculous examples. maybe  all right, so you say even if he's dead and there's no family he still could convert. that's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but okay. what about if, in fact, he goes insane? no.
he used the turning signal. that's like the strangler who observes the no smoking sign. (laughter.)
the thing that you're running the percentile against is the total number of, of expenditures and revenues in the state.
just  you say that your presumptive fees are included would cover that case. it, in part, is  resembles your case, because you didn't move to remand until the case was pending in the federal district court for over a year.
thank you.
could you clarify on the employment question something else? it's  it's in your reply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of claim with a title vii claim which  in which you say that the court in webster relied on the cia's historical practice of litigating employment disputes. the cia's historical practice, not the court's rulings. are you suggesting that even with respect to employment litigation, it's up to the cia to decide what its practice will be?
all right. well, your honor, let  let me  let me back up for just a moment then with respect to that. let me say that probable cause is not the proper standard which should be applied here. the proper standard is the standard that is set forth by this court in harlow and as refined later in anderson against creighton and a number of other decisions.
it's the knowledge issue. the special tax court judge heard somebody.
it doesn't have to be forward-looking, does it? i mean, i thought we've said "so long as it can be taken into account in any manner," whether backward-looking or forward-looking. haven't we said that, explicitly?
he was not a credible witness, your honor.
well, but congress, with respect to conditions claims  and if you look at the language of the administrative exhaustion requirement in the plra at 42 u.s.c. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without administrative exhaustion. so even congress, in thinking about the plra and in thinking about requiring administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about  it never has been about  release. habeas has traditionally been the relief that people  or the cause of action that people bring when what they're interested in is relief  or release from prison. and these claims, no one can dispute, are release-driven claims. they may not ultimately be successful in securing release, but the prisoners here 
but if we go back to what is the more usual situation 
no. if  if one moved beyond the inducement and into harmless error, the question would be  would be that there here the  the error  i think as i mentioned before, the error here would be the failure  would  would be the clerical one, the error to record findings in the act. and i think  and we would agree that the act  pointing to the second question now. but the act does expressly say that if a defendant is not tried within 70 relevant days, the indictment shall be dismissed. and that suggests that harmless error analysis would not be appropriate to the question whether 71 or 81 days of delay is appropriate because congress said 70 is 70. but when the error is not that, but the error is failing to record something in the record, that's a distinct type of error that's not covered by the mandatory dismissal provision. and it could be considered harmless, especially in circumstances where the record reflects 
but we're  we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that justice ginsburg posed.
so you're 
said nothing about the semen 
are they maximums or minimums?
so you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent? raising the railroad's standard or lowering the employee's?
i guess i should be clear at the outset that we are by no means advocating that a prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with exhausted claims. so the unexhausted claims must go.
of course.
well, even if it is not the big-ticket item 
that's true, your honor, as long as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which as you know, certainly the circumstance with the d&e, which is 95 percent of abortions, under the stenberg ruling.
uh-huh.
there's a lot of experience in brown, too, and those were local school boards, too. and i think the lesson is 
no, justice stevens. his allegation is he was picked seven times in a row for random drug testing.
they're not 
as to that aspect of the case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but they are essentially allegations of common motive, which is a less strong, i'll grant you 
well, no, because we don't think that there's a violation of the just compensation clause when someone doesn't take property, when someone doesn't act through allegedly 
your honor, i would agree that of the three hallmarks that the court recognized in stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the least central; that the other two hallmarks, the extraction to the head followed by a completely intact delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks that everyone on this court understood in stenberg, and those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that congress enacted. today general clement seems to be arguing that there is a different line that's protected in this statute, a different line than the court recognized in stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when demise occurs. but, but this court in stenberg understood that even in a classical d&e, a standard d&e, as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs. the court recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard d&e when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation occurs, and after that fetal demise. so even in a standard d&e the line that the government today is offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus, would be violated in any d&e 
because 
to give  and make it part of the appellate record. we're not asking for any remand to the tax court. if the tax court doesn't 
so the  the jewelry store owner who reports to the  the police is fleeing on a 911, that  that's not  that's not admissible under your view?
 why isn't the answer to your argument that the requirement in (b)  "knowingly" requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through the series, but it travels at least as far as "corruptly persuades"?
there may be cases where you could do mid-decade redistricting for neutral, legitimate public purposes. i submit they'll be quite rare in  in practice, but there certainly could be. our position is you can't redraw the lines purely for partisan gain, and the case i would point to that i think most strongly speaks to that is cox v. larios. in that case, the district court found that population deviations, sufficiently small that they weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't pass the rational basis test because the only explanation you could offer for those deviations was that they were systematically attempting to help the democrats at the expense of the republicans.
well, poe versus ullman was a case in which, even if there was a violation of the law, there was going to be no prosecution.
thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the united states' participation in this case is addressed to the voting rights act issues, and our position is that the district court properly concluded that the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority voting strength in either the dallas/fort worth area or the south and west region of the state. the district court based that conclusion on factual findings that are entitled to great respect on appeal and that preclude appellants' section 2 claims under this court's decisions.
but i'm a little puzzled. if the noise is the cause of their being there and if the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the door  they knock on the door several times and shout  would they not have the right to go in then to quell the noise?
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose. it is not a continuation of the appellate process. rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and state sovereignty. in brecht, this court held that the stringent chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review. instead, in order to strike a proper balance between state and federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases. petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule. he claims that if he did not receive chapman review in state court, he should receive it on federal habeas. that was not the rule in brecht and it should not be adopted by this court here. the brecht decision did not state an exception based on the state standard used. the key in brecht was that appropriate balance between the federal government and the state. this court has never treated cases where there was not a state chapman finding differently from other cases. it applies brecht throughout. in the penry case and in the o'neal case there was no chapman finding in state court, yet this court applied brecht and made no comment about that.
is there  is there any limit on the number of competitors who would have standing? you mentioned cigarette taxes. suppose one newsstand in new york city is not collecting the cigarette tax. does that mean that everybody else who's selling cigarettes in new york would be able to bring a claim?
that is the  that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the arkansas river compact administration, that you can't look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this court's decree.
well, every change  virtually every change  virtually everyone  if  if you believe the respondent's theory, virtually any state regulation of the substance of the sale will require a change in the label.
that's 
is it your position that issue preclusion doesn't apply at all, or that there was no issue decided in the state court proceeding that carries over into the federal proceeding? which one is it? what  you suggested  you said, number one, no facts were found. the question was whether there was sufficient statements to survive a 12(b)(6) or its counterpart dismissal motion.
no more than if we were one of the very few countries that didn't do this. it would bear on the question of unusual. the decision as to the eighth amendment should not be based on what happens in the rest of the world. it needs to be based on the mores of  of american society.
but, well  suppose the interaction were automatic. would that suffice to make this a wetlands after the improvement?
right.
i mean, it seems that that answer is just conclusory, that it's an exercise of the sovereign power of congress, okay. that's just  that's just a conclusion. that's not a reason.
certainly that happens, justice scalia.
i mean, it would be open to this court, presumably, to say, that treaty became part of federal law when it was ratified, and congress can enact subsequent laws. but, in any event, the treaty could give rise to individual enforceable rights. is that correct?
especially after this lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state banks?
well, i actually do not agree that there's any stronger evidence, mr. chief justice, that grand juries didn't indict when the government had adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that petit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt. in both instances, you can point to historical instances in which grand juries and petit juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there was adequate evidence. but it's clear from the neder decision that that history has not led to the conclusion that this court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for harmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a fortiori for the grand jury.
rule 19(s)?
i know that any taxes from guam are returned to guam. are additional tax revenues given to guam other than those that are derived from guam?
your honor, i think the word contract is not a precondition in the sense that respondents talk about in the sense that the court has to look into whether it's a valid contract with all the bells and whistles of state contract law because i think that is entirely inconsistent with prima paint. i think the  the answer is 
but in sutton v. english, there was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as here. the plaintiffs were just going after the property. we just want the assets. we're saying we're not touching the trust and the will. this court held  this court held, wait a minute. only the texas probate courts may determine whether these instruments are valid or not.
why?
i  no, your honor. there are two answers to that. the first answer is that the m'naghten definition of "insanity," the heart of it, has always been the right/wrong test. and this court, in leland, and, i believe, in powell, as well, have in  have always referred to m'naghten as the "right/wrong test." state courts across the country, they go 
that's right.
your honor 
 do you  is that acceptable?
no, but i thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk. in other words, i thought you were saying  maybe i misunderstood your argument  that the reason the taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a substantial step  which is what the indictment would charge  could not be seen as creating the potential risk that the statute talks about. now if i'm not understanding your argument correctly, you know, straighten me out here.
that is  that's true, the statute generally  and it's true of title ii. we would make  we would certainly defend the act as valid commerce clause legislation. but i do think that is a much more difficult argument as to title ii, generally, and particularly difficult argument with respect to prisons. i think, in that respect, it's 
information that other people have stored otherwise?
with respect 
that's correct, justice kennedy. in fact, parties do move to dismiss indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of the offense. that happened here. the motion was erroneously denied by the trial judge. the trial judge, under ninth circuit law, under the assumption that the ninth circuit has properly interpreted the law, should have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the substantial step that was part of the attempt. and if the judge had done that, then the government would have gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding indictment. instead what the judge did was deny the motion, finding that the indictment itself was sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the elements that the ninth circuit requires as part of this offense. and so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve a substantial step towards the completion of the offense.
and so, that 
that's essentially what step one of batson is 
thank you, mr. chief justice. i just have a couple of points i'd like to make. first, justice breyer, i want to start with the waiting times. i didn't actually have an opportunity to spend much time talking about them. but i think the answer that the solicitor general's office has offered with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the expandable nature of the workday. their position  justice ginsburg  or, no justice o'connor specifically asked that question, "you're not saying that waiting time prior to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the workday." and the answer is, absolutely, it does, because they find that everything that is integral and indispensable triggers the start of the workday. so, to put it into fairly graphic terms. if you have to show up in order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in order to do your services, then the waiting time for that coat counts. if, however, you also have to put in earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking in between there. so, if you're asking, "is this going to become a significant liability?" the answer is clearly yes. for very significant compensable acts  and, indeed, in this context, some of those compensable acts were found by the jury to be utterly diminimus  you're going to end up with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up with significant walking time.
and i thought that approach was exactly what we held was required in the street decision, the international association of machinists versus street, so that you can't get around this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use the others for that.
it's not trial worthy, but rather discovery worthy.
but isn't that amended if the principal place of business changes? the charter is amended.
this court has said, generally, that what the court has found to be reasonable for one state is reasonable for all. and when a practice is not well established  and here, it's far from well established; california's virtually unique  the court has taken that into account for 
and i am saying it.
absent the circumstances at arrest giving rise to a reasonable basis to believe that a crime had been committed, there would not be probable cause.
which is not subject matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with here.
even  i understand your argument. i can't tell you for sure  and i don't believe anybody can  whether those cases were or weren't argued before the texas court of criminal appeals because my understanding is  i don't  i have not seen the briefs that were filed in the batson appeal, and i don't have the transcript of the argument.
sent back to  for a new trial because the court of appeals ordered a new trial, or sent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a matter of that court's discretion, whether to order 
i mean mccarthy.
well, it's not just the value of finality. it's that, for example, if the judge makes an error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value that the defendant has in obtaining a result from the particular tribunal. in the circumstances of this case, where the trial judge can correct her error within the  within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations, there would be no double jeopardy purpose served 
 sign the 
well, but my point, your honor, is that what this court said 
right.
well, the sg's office informed us that they did a search of the reported cases. in the majority of those cases, the  the claims were brought together. the sg, i think, can give you the details on that.
and why should that make any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of a madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket for a religious purpose? if you start with the madisonian view, there should be no distinction of the two cases that justice scalia puts.
isn't it overwhelmingly likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said would you like to give money to the union to spend on elections, they would say no?
well, if ten states adopted assisted suicide, it might be a different  a different 
but that's the trial that you're trying to get set aside here.
mr. chief justice, may it please the court: in this 911 call, the operator asked a short series of questions, nearly all phrased in the present tense. each question was objectively and reasonably necessary to respond to an apparent emergency.
right.
yes.
that's not correct, your honor.
because the plaintiffs here were very careful, in light of rule 11, not to make any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest that there was a time and place 
well, then you don't have to have differing interpretations of "in connection with." you just have to know what the word "the" means.
you don't 
ms. mahoney, the patent bar is sort of specialized  more than "sort of"  it's a specialized bar, and i've never  i've never been a part of it. do you agree with the statement of the petitioner's counsel that gen-probe came as a  as a shock to the 
 to encompass the very act constituting the court itself? is that the government's  i mean, are you going to go on the record 
personally? yes. legally? no.
i think that it is possible that under some circumstances not the strength of the state's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some light on whether the third party guilt evidence is relevant. for example, if the uncontested evidence is the crime occurred on tuesday, january 3rd, and the third party guilt evidence shows that the third party was in acapulco on january 3rd and had no possibility to be there, that's not a strength issue. that is relevance. but when the touchstone for admissibility is whether the defense evidence overcomes the prosecution's case  and in the south carolina rule for  just to be clear, it's not even considered that you consider the evidence of guilt. the defense evidence of third party guilt has to overcome the prosecution's forensic evidence.
take justice breyer's pilgrim church. under your theory, if the grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums or whatever at plymouth, plymouth rock, then there wouldn't be an identifiable sum if the government said, hey, let's use some of this money to build a church?
are there any incidents in which the distributor would pay the tax if he was not able to resell it to somebody else?
well 
now, morgan ii is really on point because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. and this court held that was a violation of due process.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: an improper question or comment under edwards can be cured if the police terminate the questioning and make it clear to the suspect that they will honor his decision whether or not to talk to them 
 that says, "we'll let this evidence" 
so, in conclusion, your honors, we submit that there are two  two approaches to affirming the florida supreme court. first is  is that it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent. the second is that because of the nature of the statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy process where the state's case was not tested in any way. in fact, as i mentioned, there were 35 witnesses. there were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what date was it and when did certain things occur. there was not the material testing of the record to determine the truth, which is what is  is involved in the sixth amendment. and none of  none of the challenges, that are pointed out in  to the facts in our brief ever came out because that there was no testing. simply we have an opening statement where counsel says the state will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred. then we have virtually no cross examination. we have no witnesses called by the state  excuse me  by  by the defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial. and in fact, at one point, the  the trial judge stopped asking  asking mr. corin if he wished to cross examine. and then we have the closing statement where mr. corin stated that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that  that he is  mr. nixon was guilty of the crimes. and all the while during that guilt phase, mr. nixon was not present in the courtroom. so he had no ability to object to the opening or the closing statements because he wasn't here  there to hear them. and further, as  as the record indicates, there are issues of  of mr. nixon's competency, that he's mentally retarded. his own lawyer referred to him as nuts. his own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in his closing argument. these are the types of statements, we would submit, are  even if they are not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent, they  they substantially and completely destroy the advocacy process. so there is no testing, and under cronic, the court should affirm also. thank you.
well, of course you 
okay. well, i'm  i'm not going to take the hobson's choice, your honor, but i am going to tell you, first of all, that sabic is going to apply for cert. at least that's my current understanding. and second of all, that shows why this case is not justiciable at this point because if the most likely event in the  in the event of this court's review of the delaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of limitations problem. that's the reason this suit was brought as the, quote, insurance policy that the third circuit identified, which was if the delaware supreme court or the delaware superior court had kicked this suit on the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations  and if you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the corrected supplemental brief that we filed with the court, including the delaware supreme court's opinion, you'll see that they had a whale of a time getting over the plain language of their own statute.
where does it say that?
no. but on justice  justice scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to remove latinos as latinos. and maybe the answer to that is if you're removing latinos, it does not matter whether your motivation is invidious or not. i don't know whether that's your position. but it  if that's not your position, then i think there's got to be a difference between the  the equal protection clause analysis and the section 2 analysis.
i think what they are saying is the defense of qualified immunity should be available if there should be probable cause for the action that was taken here. i think the case before the court is on the very limited issue of whether the defense of qualified immunity is available to the petitioners.
that was a justification for rewriting instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole or in part." i do not think they raised an abstract argument about equivalency; that in order to do that, official they would have had to object to instruction 12 and instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would require modification of both instructions, and they clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12 and only object to instruction 13. so no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised. it was a justification for one particular result, and that was a result that would have modified instruction 13. and in a particular way, too, modified it in a way of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."
well, your honor, the  the photographs that you have are photographs that are taken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and sent for testing. you're not seeing everything that  that the agent saw. special agent scott saw what he believed to be blood. he couldn't  he didn't know it was blood, but  but he suspected it was blood. he identified in  in the habeas proceeding the areas that he believed it to be blood, and it turned out to be blood. jerry morissey, who was the defense serologist and  and, incidentally, just to  that reminds me of  of a comment made by my colleague in his argument about defense counsel's deficiency in not  in not hiring a serological expert. he had a serological expert. jerry morissey testified, was a serologist, and testified that he received the jeans after the fbi tested it. he was unable to duplicate the result, but as part of his testimony, he said that he observed some bloodstains, what he thought to be bloodstains, around the fbi cuttings, and he attempted to do additional testing on those bloodstains. so he saw the stains. agent bigbee testified that he observed the stains. he didn't say that some were big or some were small. he said that he observed them. as well, paulette sutton in the federal habeas proceeding said that she saw the stains. she said she couldn't tell upon observation that it was blood, but it was dark and she suspected it was blood. it was suspicious. so we have at least four witnesses who say they saw this blood. this wasn't microscopic. this was something that  that witnesses  and incidentally, paulette sutton's observation was borne out because she did presumptive testing. so the things that  the spots that she suspected were blood in fact turned out to be blood.
so if  if the contention in the  in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will which has been probated by the state probate court is, in fact, not the true will and that under the true will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think the bankruptcy court would  would have jurisdiction to probate the will.
the answer to that would be yes. he might end up being precluded, if he lost in federal court on the constitutional claim, from coming back on the statutory claim.
right.
or the depiction on the door of the court?
it would seem to me 
i think it is mitigating, and the fact that there is a question about one of the people, perhaps the accomplice, which very well could have been mr. sanders, wanting to leave before the murder occurred was basis enough to give the jury pause. and if we look at the deliberations, we realize that there was a jury note, about three-quarters of the way through its deliberations, asking the jury the consequences if it could not reach a unanimous jury verdict.
you're charging someone more based on credit.
two things about that. when he's saying it internally, he's doing his job. when he's going externally, he may be violating office policies.
 that's 
but with parental  they are wards of their parents.
mr. chief justice, the evidence was  that was suppressed was everything that the officer or officers saw once they entered the home and/or heard once they entered the home, basically anything that they obtained once they entered the home. the answer to your honor's 
we recognize that it's an unusual request, because of the unusual circumstances. and, of course, the alternative, if the court is not prepared to stay, or, for example, vacate, in light of the presidential determination, remand to the court of appeals 
in the district court, there were issues raised as to all defendants as far as various sentencing enhancements. in front of the eleventh circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was rejected. as to mr. hall, one of the sentencing enhancements were argued and was reversed on that sentencing enhancement. but there is still a sentencing enhancement that was raised in the eleventh circuit, but it was not raised in this petition. it was not the issue that this court granted cert on, but we would argue that it's still a valid  a valid claim and that this court should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision in booker and fanfan.
it doesn't have to be unique to mail. if it is unique to mail, if there's no private-party analog, the federal tort claims act doesn't apply, by its own terms. but what  i mean, there is a distinct and unique postal act of putting things into the mailbox.
yes. zero.
that's certainly one way.
now, what's wrong with that opinion?
are you saying to us that under the california system, if a california judge went through exactly the thought process that justice scalia just outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he could go to the third tier? i really think deterrence requires the third tier, not the middle tier? can a california judge do that?
thank you, your honor.
well, congress has said  congress has said the contrary. and there are often important differences between state and federal courts. justice breyer, i think you have some experience in california. we have 9 to 3 jury verdicts. you will have a litigant here next year saying that the difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really important. now, i would just briefly like to go back to justice ginsburg's question about a jury because i don't think she got the full answer. let me give it to you, justice ginsburg. the jury issue is virtually  i would say not virtually. the jury issue is out of this case based on my adversary's reply brief. i will tell why you. we did ask for a jury trial in our case and we were upset about the whole notion of this case being removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in  we never sued powerex  losing our right to a jury trial on this important case. mr. frederick's reply brief says at footnote 4, page 3  or footnote 3, page 4; i apologize  that our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct they do exist  i'm not sure they're unanimous  our right to jury trial would survive even though he would have a right to a bench trial under his theory. well, there is no right to a jury trial on the cross claim against mr. frederick's client. the cross claim in the california court, which got this whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury trial. so i think we are all now in agreement on a jury trial. we are arguing someone else's case. some day a litigant will appear in this court and present the issue of jury trial 
well, you're not answering my question. i  we all agree that he needs to understand the basic concept of mitigation. does his waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that i just described? or doesn't it? what's your position?
i have just three points. the fifth circuit had precisely the same record before it that this court had and the state submitted very nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the fifth circuit the time before. disparate questioning on the minimum punishment ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire and it was acknowledged. if you look at the batson argument, it's either mr. macaluso or mr. nelson said some of the jurors were questioned disparately, but  and they gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the death penalty. so it was before the state courts. now, on the graphic script, which is the disparate questioning that ms. bunn has focused the court's attention on, the state now says, okay, we can't speculate about what we don't know about the questionnaires. let's just look at the questionnaires that we do know about. justice stevens, it is  you are quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have, but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this case because what we know from the questionnaire answers that we have is that every black who expressed anything that could be called hesitation on their juror questionnaire, including just not filling in either question  answering question 56 or 58, got it. five whites who expressed hesitation did not. that is juror mazza, juror hearn, juror duke, ms. girard, who testified that she didn't  who acknowledged in her voir dire that she hadn't filled out one of those questions which got similarly situated african american jurors the graphic script, and juror whaley who  or venireman whaley who testified that her questionnaire expressed great hesitation about the death penalty. and what we also know is that the three jurors who got the graphic script, troy woods, the black juror; mr. gutierrez, the hispanic juror; and marie sztybel, the only jewish juror. if the court has no further questions.
if justice stewart agreed completely with what the court said, why did he write a separate opinion?
justice scalia, if the court 22 rejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under 23 paragraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the state claim, 24 we think it should still reject petitioner's 25 interpretation and should adopt our alternative 1 interpretation which is not subject to that objection 2 because our alternative interpretation assumes that the 3 facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the state 4 conviction. but in light of the due diligence requirement 5 at the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could 6 that vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered 7 through the exercise of due diligence.
but it's a very qualified one.
is sovereignty something that the tribe can lose by inaction over a period of time?
yes.
it becomes a question of motive and how do we know what the motive is?
well, i thought the  i thought the reason they conceded the blakely violation was that in the instructions to the jury, the instruction only went to deadly weapon and the instruction did not specifically refer to firearm. i thought that's why they  they stipulated that there was a blakely error. as a matter of the fact about the instruction, is  is my description correct?
for resale 
this  this is a death case. it was not that amusing. let me ask you this. doesn't the state have some minimal obligation under the eighth amendment to do the necessary research to assure that this is the most humane method possible? doesn't the state have a minimal obligation on its own to do that?
why don't we go back to my other question to be sure i got your point. the reimbursement is paid to whom?
well, your honor, the answer is, congress dealt with this issue and decided that no one gets to get in line and get their attorneys' fees, regardless of whether they're solvent or not. it's a 
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: if i may, i'd like to frame the merits very quickly and then turn immediately to standing. although the case before you arises in an important policy area, it turns on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation and administrative law. epa made a decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute plain errors of law reviewable under any standard. epa's principle grounds was that it lacked authority over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. that legal conclusion fails as a matter of law. as a fallback position, epa declined to consider if these substances are endangering public health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in section 1202 of the clean air act. although epa possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling on impermissible grounds as it did here. we are not asking the court to pass judgment on the science of climate change or to order epa to set emission standards. we simply want epa to visit the rulemaking petition based upon permissible considerations. and now, your honor, i'd like to turn to standing. petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute was aimed at preventing. for example, our uncontested affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and the seas rise. and of course as the seas expand, they rise everywhere around the world. some areas such as massachusetts will be hit particularly hard because we're also subject to a land subsidence, but that 
no, but  if we see it your way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed tomorrow morning?
 that that hurts you somewhat. if you want to give us this visual metaphor of a scale, or a football field, where you move it beyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger case than saying the jurors can establish their aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor they want, for any reason, and apply it. and they can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it. it seems to me that that's  that that's a weaker argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that was our controlling metaphor.
mr. chief justice and may it please the court: when seattle was last before this court you struck down a state law that prevented bussing for integration purposes because that law prevented the school board from seeking to provide the educational benefits of integrated schools. at that time you said it was clear enough that all children benefit from exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom by preparing them for citizenship in our pluralistic society and teaching them to live in harmony and mutual respect.
justice breyer, i think this is the point in the argument where i want to turn to the definition of review as this court has  has put it forth in cases like asarco. this is a case that exxon mobil dismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum. i don't think that this  the discussion of rooker-feldman and the asarco case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was a specific response to a specific proposal by the united states appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of standing and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second suit. in that case, the court wrote that to re adjudicate  and i'm quoting here from the opinion, and i don't have the particular page here  to re-adjudicate the very same issues that were determined in the state court proceedings would be  again quoting  in essence, an attempt to obtain direct review of the arizona supreme court's decision in the lower federal courts. in asarco, there was no reference to what the intent of the plaintiffs was. there was no reference to what the timing of the lawsuits was. it was simply that identical issues actually litigated.
well, i think that's true, justice ginsburg, but it just shows that that's the way that this court approaches as-applied cases. it's not a matter of reading something in. its saying the statute doesn't apply. thank you.
but his theory was if there was a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that all was left was a  a killing for some other reason. and if there was a killing  if there was a failure of proof on attempted robbery, would he not then have been entitled to a  a lesser offense instruction?
yes. we would have to breathe life back into the stay and abey 
but the new policy is introduced at trial. and the  the question is  really what you're saying, justice breyer, is the mere introduction of the new policy renders the whole case  case moot.
that's exactly what i'm trying to find out. that's  that's what i'm  i'm trying to figure out in my mind how close this is to the federal government running a uniform program. i mean, everybody agrees federal law governs questions involving the rights of the united states 
on revenue, the nondiscriminatory means that's available to the state that michigan and new york have not shown any reason to reject  26 states have adopted some version of this  is to require an out-of-state winery to get a permit. and that's a  justice breyer, one thing that's still left of brandeis. you can require a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would be unusual to acquire from widgets or milk. but you can require a permit, and, as a condition of the permit, justice souter. the out-of-state winery has to agree to submit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the state's tax jurisdiction. and, justice kennedy, whether or not quill would permit taxation if you were simply sending by common carrier, our clients want to  want to pay taxes, want to sign up for permits, want to play on a 
 the government's interpretation would significantly broaden section 924(c) to include federal misdemeanors.
of course it would, so 
yes.
on  on that point, i have  i have one question. at page 3a of the petition appendix, the washington supreme court's opinion is set forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to the contrary, when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury, the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the state is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon. and then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the enhancement, the state alleged there is no element of a firearm. the element is assault with a deadly weapon. i don't  this was at the sentencing proceeding, i take it?
i believe so. you have to find, justice o'connor, that race was the but-for factor or the tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for factor for at least one to come within the four corners of batson. now, i could argue i think, if i needed to in this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially excluding jurors from the venire, comes within batson, the batson proscription itself, or i could argue that case too.
 absolutely.
when  when was our first holding to that effect?
and which we maintain that it is jurisdictional. i'm not sure, your honor, whether or not there is, in fact, any waiver because 
there is a safeguard between the vessel and whether a person qualifies as a jones act seaman on that vessel.
certainly  certainly, justice scalia, there was.
goldberg v. kelly, welfare benefits, money.
 your question is, yes.
mr. hungar, i have a question that's sort of along the lines of justice ginsburg's. it isn't just the federal circuit that has been applying this test. it's also the patent office and it's been following the federal circuit's test for 20 years or so. what, what is  assuming that we sweep that test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to the presumption of validity of, of patents which the courts have been, have been traditionally applying? does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid which have been issued under an erroneous test for the last 20 years?
may i go back to the heat of passion point? you say he did not put on evidence, but wasn't there evidence in the record through a state's witness that at least would have supported a heat of passion argument, the evidence being that he went up to the car, no gun was apparent, something happened. evidence shows that he was sprayed with mace, and at that point, he pulls out a gun and shoots. that, i suppose, is evidence of heat of passion. couldn't he have asked for a heat of passion instruction even though he did not put on the heat of passion evidence himself?
not at 
some of them state department and 
yes, your honor, it is. your honor, i'd like to make the further point that  and i think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that since under your decisions the state can prohibit a union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it is reasonable for the state to impose a condition on that collection which falls, falls far short of actually prohibiting it. we further point out that in the hudson case the illinois statute at issue was effectively an opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the more generous washington state statute which allows the union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or reduced just to reflect 760 expenses. it seems to us that it is within the power of the state to establish such a condition in the interest of an election's integrity by means of protecting the first amendment interests of the non-members, and we think the statute does that very well without imposing in fact a substantial administrative burden on the union in this case or unions in general. for example, the, the way that the wea or any union can comply with section 760 would be to simply place an additional form in the hudson packet they send out. now, recognizing that the hudson packet is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers in september, the busiest month of the year for teachers, and that there is no form currently provided in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out, but rather a statement that you must send a letter to the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy. and we look to the wea pac for instruction on what they could do. but now. because the wea has chosen to form a pac and is required to solicit members and non-members if they choose in order to contribute to that pac, they do a very good job of soliciting members. they include a very convenient form encouraging people to check off and send their dues in to the pac to support candidate elections. they provide no such form for the opt-out process, but it would be easy for them to do so. the burden imposed on them is not great administratively, as they suggest, any more than the burden on the other teachers unions in abood or in hudson because it can easily be met through these simple. if there are no further questions, your honor, i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
under the  under the district court's view, would there have been original jurisdiction against powerex?
yes. yes.
 justice stevens, that probable cause it not a very high standard. and in  - many search warrants are, in fact, served on the homes of people who are not suspected, because they're thought to be the place where stuff was stored, but not be the people who are suspected of doing anything wrong in the first place.
what we think, your honor, is that they did not prove that that was not the case, and the burden of proof to sustain jurisdiction was theirs.
i don't think so, your honor. if i may try to explain. i think as a general matter, with regard to physical evidence in the home that's within the scope of the search warrant, that you're  you're probably right. most of the time, that evidence will come in. we think that there are probably at least two areas that might lead to suppression in these cases. one is the  the type of statements that the chief justice mentioned earlier. another might be what you might call proximity evidence, that the officers went in prematurely and as a result, they saw a 
and i'm trying to figure out is 
yes, your honor.
and the batson procedure would work.
i don't know if i have to go quite that far because i have more evidence than that in this particular case, because i have the fact that they say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just a definitional point. we do have a legislative history that seems to have in mind this regulatory background; and we've been told by epa that when congress incorporated modification, it really did incorporate that luggage, baggage as well.
no. he is represented by counsel, obviously, your honor. i  i think it inappropriate to draw lines between pro se and represented counsel, though, in the realm of habeas. that i think invites trouble. so the rule you formulate is obviously not only for rhines but for pro se litigants as well that  that deserve consideration. this exhaustion rule is not to be an  a trap for the unwary pro se petitioner. the whole purpose of the exhaustion rule, as this court said in keeney v. tamayo-reyes, is to  not to erect a hurdle on the path to federal habeas court, but to channel claims into an appropriate forum. and stay and abeyance does just that. it prohibits further proceeding on a mixed petition in federal court and channels, indeed requires, as a term of the order that the petitioner go and exhaust the remaining state remedy and come back to court with one exhausted claim. that is what rose v. lundy contemplated and allowed with the dismissal without prejudice.
but let me, then, point out the very different paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute and this statute. in your ordinary tort claim statute, your ordinary litigation, the law starts out by being neutral with respect to the status quo. and that's the reason why you have this rule  we don't think it is called "traditional rule" appropriately  but the general rule that you place the burden on the party who initiates litigation is because the law is neutral with respect to the status quo at the beginning of the lawsuit. here, the law is not neutral, because the status quo before the hearing is: the child has no individualized education program.
you are absolutely correct.
 we're now talking federal rules. go ahead.
what do you mean, how do you it failed to consider? i mean, is there an obligation to respond to every single point that's made?
yes.
so it may not be the same issue. then  then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. and therefore, they could proceed with their federal case, which is what they want to do i guess.
i think that it would pass the inquiry. i suppose you could  you could 
well, i hope i can put those to rest. on the first concern, i think that there are differences between a train wreck and habeas. most of my habeas cases are train wrecks, so i hope that's not  but i think there is a logical difference between them. but i think when you look carefully at the case of tiller, those really were very different facts about the head car not being lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit. after all, those were two separate legal claims, as well.
well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation. so you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say corporation again.
black and white alike, in large numbers. no plan, your honor, can be 
no. his hypothetical is all you've done is to allege the final sentence without the preceding clause, the five or six lines before there's a comma. that's out. all there is is the allegation of the conspiracy. is that enough in this case?
all right. if that's correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, which we have to have federal abstention rules or it won't be worked out properly, or we have to have federal tolling rules. i don't see any way to get to a sensible result here without either having clear abstention rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as i suggested before. am i right? if i'm wrong, let me know why; and if i'm right, which do you prefer?
would you answer my question?
i think the federal circuit was right, as a factual matter, in describing the impetus for congress adopting section 271(e).
there were significant tactical advantages to lincoln, whatever its relationship with these entities, in being in federal court. the plaintiff preferred a state-court venue where there was no daubert and there was no summary judgment permissible on the basis of affidavits and deposition testimony.
well, if it's under the language of section 1367, i think it makes more sense to say the court has original jurisdiction over the action, but lacks original jurisdiction over the defective claims. i mean, that meets what 1367 seems to say on its face.
 but the court can still 
i think the law and this court reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies available to them through challenging individual 
 this question? supposing the evidence is equally divided on the question of whether he thought it was a martian who he had a right to kill. could he be convicted of murder, constitutionally?
 was that the common law, federal common law precluded, preempted any state law which contradicted this contract. now, you can  you can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the contract preempted state law, but it wasn't 
yes, your honor. we believe that under almost any system, incumbents are going to still have advantages and no campaign finance system can fully address that. but we believe that if the challenger now has the ability to outspend the incumbent and the incumbent doesn't have that additional advantage of being able to outspend the challenger, as is most often the case, then competition can only be enhanced.
your honor, i think that if geico in this example, if you actually pay them less because you looked at their credit report, then geico would concede that that is in fact an adverse action. so i don't think it's inconsistent at all. thank you, your honor.
mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: before it relinquished jurisdiction over this case, the court of appeals engaged in sua sponte reconsideration to correct a clear error in its prior decision which called into question the reliability of mr. thompson's death sentence. that 
 the crucial difference 
no. this 
okay. in a case like this, then it would be in the interest of someone like your client to make a claim not of $3 million but of $6 million. then if you settle for exactly the same amount of money you settled for here, the percentage of the medicals  the amount attributed to medicals would be exactly one-half of what it is here.
it can't be both. [laughter.]
 for purposes of argument.
oh, it could happen in many moments.
those declarations appear 
i'm sorry?
i'm saying that they have it, but in order for this court to conclude that reversal of a trial that can be presumed fundamentally fair, because the defendant, in fact, went to trial with counsel who he had chosen, albeit as his second choice, should not occur with all of the societal impacts that that has, the potential for victims to have to go through a retrial.
again, i  what we're saying is the unique situation of an attorney and a client, it is the attorney who's taking the laboring, or unlike the entertainer example where the  where  or the athlete example 
no 
yes, but they were wrong about that. if, if there was exhaustion in the case, and if there is no rule that you must name everything the defendant that you end up suing, if those two are established, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot question? moot in this case?
 that is not prohibited under the controlled substances act if the doctor was acting consistent with the specific terms of the act and the specific terms of the state statutes.
 we acknowledge that we tolerate political motivation in the context of map-drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes being served, which is to say at the beginning of the decade when they have to redraw the map anyway.
yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion. the  in this case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did have some people that actually were confused. and when that happens, you need to look at what is causing the confusion. and essentially 
it has to be close on an alternative murderer. it wasn't suicide. obviously, if he didn't do it, somebody else did. so if it's a close case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the second.
because at  at common law  and i think this was an important insight. at common law, it was not even evidence of the absence of probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on the determination that a factfinder  a reasonable fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actually committed the crime. probable cause is a very different standard, which is whether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent person to believe that a crime had been committed. that is the 
would you  would you agree 10 that but for the questions from the jury, simmons was 11 complied with? the counsel argued the point to the 12 jury 
yes, justice souter. the difference is the "discharge into." to have something "discharge into the river," you need something different than the river to go into the river.
but now we're talking about land that  where there are no tribe members, as i understand it, in this area is predominantly non-tribal members.
but it seems to me unrealistic to assume that the average citizen would know that duty more clearly than he'd know the duty to pay his taxes.
i will ask 
now, do you want to go into anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?
 if mohawk were a partnership instead of a corporation 
and i think you have to rest on your argument, that what we are talking about is the gravity of his crime "for purposes of sentencing." i understand that argument. but then, when you go on to make the argument you just made, the jury understands it is a single moral judgment, what  is there some specific instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k) instruction itself?
why is it difficult to figure out what the ninth circuit was thinking? i  i found it  am i right? i thought they said the  the seller says we found gold. the stock sells for $60. they have loads of experts who say in the absence of that statement, which was a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10. the loss is $50. i mean, i take it that's their theory.
right. but we are only doing that in response to the respondent's argument. i'm not  we didn't bring to this court an affirmative argument that said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate cause. that's not the argument we made. the argument 
but it also found that there were dozens of statutes, i think  didn't justice scalia list in his opinion for  it went on for a couple of pages, including footnotes? i think it was over 30 that did mention experts. it mentioned attorneys' fees and expert fees.
but if they don't do that, is it your argument that simply by behaving differently from the way congress assumed when it passed the statute, that raises the plausible inference of violation?
suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was  and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 commandments has played an important role in the civic lives of our people. then you have  they're each up for five years and five years later, some school kids wander by one and they wander by the other. in your view, from what you're telling me, the commandments are permitted in one location and not the other? i mean, that's the necessary purport of your argument. you may not think that either of them are valid but on this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to differentiate, i just don't understand that.
i think our argument  or the  the proposition that we are arguing for today is that when the documents and the state court file indicate that the defendant was arrested for only burglary of a building and there's no question that it wasn't a ship or a vehicle, that it will support the acca 
that is correct.
yes, she could, your honor, and in fact, that is what the majority 
suppose, in the memo here, the assistant district attorney had said, "i think that this deputy lied, and i think the deputy should be fired." now, whether the deputy should be fired or not probably isn't within the job duties of this  of this employee. so, would that be outside of your rule?
it is, mr. chief justice, although not on the theory of third-party consent. the analog to your hypothetical, which is this court's decision in lopez, is justice thomas' reference to coolidge versus new hampshire  to the new hampshire case. and what happens there is, this  mrs. randolph could take the cocaine and give it to the officer. she was participating in giving an item to them. it is not the same, i think, when she authorizes the police to conduct a generalized search of the premises. it would be as if 
it was inference upon inference upon inference. that's not what we're talking about here.
indeed, the market in  the dealership market, whatever  if that's a separate market, which it might be  becomes more concentrated, and the result of  you know, i could make a  tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law. so we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to morton salt, because morton salt, after all, was a case that was quite formalistic. it didn't really look to the injury to competition in a market. it had a formalistic slogan that would, in fact, be a proxy for that.
there's an example of the report form that is filled out by the prison officials at the time that a reclassification is going to occur, and the inmate does have access to that report form at the time of notice.
rather than a member  is  is  if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. then the case is easy i think.
aren't  aren't you 
the eeoc has taken a different position but that decision that the eeoc has taken has been based on its reading of this court's decision in bazemore, and this court does not give deference to the eeoc under skidmore or under any other standard.
yeah. and if the solicitor, and if epa had enacted the regulation that they proposed but didn't enact, that says major modification means modification, then we might have an argument there. but the concept that when you have modification as a core official baseline construction  i mean trigger for the applicability of this portion of the scheme, and then you take that same  and you not only do it once but you do it twice, and you do it in the context of an entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement this statutorily  or implement this before the statute was enacted, and you have congress saying well, you didn't get that right, but you did get this right, and they leave this language exactly in the way it is, the only fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to me 
certainly not. and the terms of an injunction are appealable, and the federal circuit has reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and reversed a number of them and said this is  this doesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other requirements. but in the  in the context of this case, it is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not vacated, because this is a real inventor. this is somebody who really did try to put it in place. this is somebody who ebay approached and then, when they didn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the validity and infringement are final. they aren't even challenged in this court. and any suggestion that uncertainty exists on the facts of this case would dramatically destabilize settled law, licensing practices, and the investment-backed expectations of patent holders, large and small, the sole  you know, hall of fame inventors that are in the cooper brief filed in support of us and big, integrated companies like ge and johnson & johnson that have also filed on our side.
what if i had an example where they were equal  equally effective as recruitment avenues. could they  could they make the military take one that was equally effective, but it sent a message, "well, we really don't like what you're doing"?
i disagree, justice scalia, because the court has said that this evidence, regardless  with respect to the grandfather  regardless of its substance, is to be admitted. and if it's to be admitted, it is to be considered. the statute with 
they could see that they were minors.
if so, if i'm right on it, then what we're lacking from your point of view here is a claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful. and i agree with you. if you make that claim, i don't think the ftc can insulate it, i guess, unless there's something i don't know about, but you're not making the claim anyway. so here, unlike citizens publishing, we're  we have to deal with this on the assumption that the joint venture is lawful.
but the government always acquiesces in the propriety of seeking mandate from the court of appeals?
yes, your honor.
you know, that's kind of a tough position to put the lawyer in. if he's not a competent authority for notification purposes and he makes the judgment that, you know, i don't think it's going to do any good to notify the consulate, wouldn't he be better advised not to tell his client about it? because if he does, then it's, i guess, harmless error that the state hasn't notified him, and if he doesn't, it's kind of an ace in the hole. you see how the trial goes, and at the end say, by the way, the state never notified my client.
jump in whenever you want. (laughter.)
they were talking about the right that was asserted.
it would make the future cases a lot easier to decide.
there is a practical effect.
that's absolutely right, justice scalia, and every case that 
 federal government seems to be trying to provide those incentives. is that a problem?
correct.
no effective remedy in the litigation itself.
okay.
that was dismissed as moot because of the jurisdictional issue, your honor. so whether or not that is waived or not  i agree with you. it's not before this court today, but i don't think it's a matter that can be decided by this court either. it's a matter, if this court should decide that it is a merits issue, that goes back to the trial court on remand.
justice ginsburg, it's not unusual for this court to decide a case where the government does not challenge the underlying constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument. two very notable examples are united states versus leon, where the government did not challenge the underlying fourth amendment claim that was found to be valid by the lower court, but instead simply asked for a modification of the exclusionary rule; and another example is rose versus clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to this one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to incorporate into the jury instructions the actual element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable presumption. in that case the state did not challenge whether the instruction violated the constitution. this court didn't decide it. instead, what it decided was the remedial question of harmless error, which is an important question and i submit doesn't change in character depending on the nature of the underlying error.
uh-huh. yes, that is the nub.
mr. cotter, i don't  i don't see, in the opinion, any indication that the ninth circuit was doing what you  what you assert it was trying to do  namely, to predict what future california law  locked deep in the bosom of the california supreme court, but not yet disclosed to the public  will hold. it didn't proceed that way at all. it says, generally, the united states can be held liable only when liability was attached to a private actor. however, the united states may be liable, quoting from one of the ninth circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a state or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred. i don't see they are saying, "we are trying to predict what california would do in a private situation." they have set forth a rule that, where there's no cause of action against a private person, we look to whether there would be a cause of action under  against a state or subdivision of the state.
yes, and the longer that an employee waits the longer it is for her to sustain her burden of proof on that score. and in fact 
but because the other side is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive, and you have to prove that you would never  you made  you would have brought the prosecution even if there had been no retaliatory motive. that's what we're arguing 
 justice scalia, but  which i think is an important 
well, i mean, i think  i think the test would be whether it's  whether it's reasonably the consent  what they're asking you to agree to is reasonably related to the purposes of punishment. and, in this case, the  you know, the supervision of the parolee, rehabilitation, protection of public safety. and so, we think the consent argument works very well here. but, if i could, i'd like to also address our arguments under the totality of the circumstances and special needs. faced with a serious recidivism problem, california has made the reasonable judgment that subjecting parolees to suspicionless searches is necessary to protect public safety and to promote rehabilitation.
i think they  what  the argument that i heard was not that all the claims have to be aggregated, but that they can't get in the door.
correct. and in  it identified 
he doesn't enter judgment to trigger the 50(b) motion. the 50(b) motion is made in between the verdict and the entry of judgment.
and that  that's when the convention came into effect?
does always answer the question because it is understood that, having shown at step one it is more likely than not that there's discrimination, silence at step two will result in an adverse finding. and 
may i ask this question? supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree  on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?
i draw it from the entire line of cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo cases, the local 
well, justice souter, you have a foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a foreign country under foreign engineering standards 
that's a violation of  i mean, what i'm driving at is, i don't really understand rule 15 thoroughly, because i'm not a trial lawyer. and why do we have to decide every matter? why don't we let the district judge free to run his trial and just say, "hey, we don't want to proliferate law. it's complicated enough already. let's leave it to rule 15, whatever that might be"?
you say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. now, tell me specifically, if you can  and this may take you the whole time. you want to make whatever argument you want. what is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?
well, this court obviously has decided establishment clause cases on a case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance, the ten commandments displayed in a museum-like setting on the capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other monuments, the message that is received by the viewer who is trekking through the capitol grounds looking at monuments is clearly one not of the state of texas.
okay.
 to the balancing test 
i don't think that they need to because that is something that, again, it would be a useful thing given that there are 50 legislatures out there and there are probably at least 20 and perhaps 31 similar statutes that rather than certify the question and then have to certify on a state-by-state basis, just to adopt a background rule that this court applies.
well  well, the  the filibuster issue, as it related to that session of congress, it was thought that it was going to come to a head in  in october  excuse me  but it  but as a  but it did not. so that is the reason why it was  it would not have been run after november.
no, you could not say that, justice scalia. this court did not infer the right of self-representation from the assistance of counsel clause. it inferred it from the network of rights that are provided in the sixth amendment 
that 
well, but that  that sounds like the complaint that you're making. we have a problem, say, with  with the newspapers or whatever it is. it's awfully dicey as to whether they should form this joint venture. it's going to eliminate a lot of competition. but now what you're saying is, look, at the very least, they should structure it in a way that the independent pricing decision is made by equilon. don't structure the pricing decision so that bit by bit, day by day it's made out by six people, half of whom represent shell, half of whom represent texaco. i can see that as an argument. this is more restrictive than necessary.
no, but why isn't your answer to him that in the case in which there is a variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're talking about there is none? and the reason i press you on that is that i thought the essence of your case was that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury function has not been performed and he is entitled to the grand jury function before he goes to trial.
well, if it were not  if it did not serve the function  it doesn't matter what the government's intent is and what is in the mind of the prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue rule. certainly, it deters future violations. the sentence was based on the  an estimate of the intended loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in canada to determine what the amount was that was owed. and so the district court became, essentially, part of the tax enforcement apparatus of the government of canada by performing that assessment in the first instance. and so anytime that we impose criminal or civil liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of another country, we are enforcing that rule. if we  whether we're requiring compliance with the  with the tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance. all of those 
is there a provision of arkansas law that if in fact they do track down the property owner and he is at an address different from the last address that he had given, that the expense of tracking him down may be charged to him, along with the delinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?
congress can pass another statute, if it needs to, and the government 
 which would exempt spousal abuse cases, by and large, until we  until we enact a federal spousal abuse statute, which  which may well occur. it seems to me there  there are better ways to  to solve this problem than to design the whole confrontation clause jurisprudence on the basis of what happens in spousal abuse cases.
how would you, how would you  go back for a second, please, because, if you're finished with that, because i don't see how to decide for you without at the same time permitting a person to walk over to the patent office, to read that application and the description, which after all at least can be a very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in europe. they then make it. and that on your reading would violate the statute. it can't be right that that would and you don't even think it would.
 why does one of them express one thing and another not express 
in more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.
normally, there's no distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy cases. so why bother?
so at some point, i would appreciate your addressing that.
that would be  that would be the question.
i would like to think that, your honor, but, actually, as opposing counsel has indicated, congress eliminated the language  the pre-existing language that placed some sort of requirement  it removed the "plain, speedy, and effective" language, removed the "minimum standards" language. the indication was that they wouldn't be reviewed for the adequacy of the standards.
your honor, timbers has the structural argument that focuses on what the purpose of 506(b) is. but there are more indications. it would be odd for congress, for example, to draft this provision 506(b) that purports to put post-petition attorneys' fees on the same footing at post-petition interest if it intended to put them on different footings. it's an observation this court made in ron pair. moreover, congress was not oblivious to the existence of attorneys' fees post-petition. there are 15 occasions in the code where congress spoke to attorneys' fees and if congress had intended attorneys' fees to be available to this enormous class of unsecured creditors, one would think that it would not have hidden that in the definition of "claim" 
i'd like you to get to the meaning of the hobbs act.
oh, yes. yes. they offer  the popular schools to which everyone had access under this plan who wanted access, i think it's  there is no dispute.
but even if it's marginal 
so  so it was referenced in the petition for rehearing.
now i think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say. and as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?
because 
well 
justice stevens, and may it please the court: first, with respect to the question about the due process rights below, i would note that the government does not challenge, and specifically said so in footnote 2 of the petition for cert and footnote 1 in their brief on the merits, whether there is a due process claim here. i would encourage you  and i will come back to the due process question if you're interested. i'd encourage you to look at the respondents' appendix, pages 72 to 74, where the cia employee described the fact that there are, in fact, regulations that are not limited to enforcing a secret contract. that is not our claim.
well, your honor, as the district court found  and this is on page 85 of our jurisdictional statement appendix  it wasn't that there was bias in the map that the court drew. it was that there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly favored the republicans in the court-drawn map. it just so happened that the voters in those districts, in six of those republican-leaning districts, happened to like voting for moderate to conservative democrats who they were comfortable with. now, if you tell me  i  i find difficulty  i find it difficult to understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as a matter of  use the machinery of government to decide that those voters should not have that opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake.
well, i  i would  our fraud exception that  that we  we are delineating here is material, intentional conduct that subverts the process. and it can't be just anyone, your honor.
the  the fact existed all along. i mean, the  the fact doesn't come into existence once it's found. the finding reflects the fact that the fact of an incompetency had existed during the entire relevant period.
well, if 
 in the country 
because the term "principal activity," i believe, as, you yourself, pointed out, is listed in the first  at (a)(1). that's the first place it appears. everywhere else it appears, including in (a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says "said principal activities." so, the statute itself tells you that the term "principal activities" has to mean the same thing everywhere it appears. and since you have already interpreted that term, in steiner, to include "integral and indispensable activities," that terminology has to appear everywhere in the statute.
under the commerce clause, i  that's exactly right, that would be our position. it is constitutional on its face, and it  and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole 
what other alternatives would you have the prison administrators rely on? you have an incorrigible prisoner who's misbehaving. he won't behave. they go through every  he gets up to level  level 2. what  what should they have done instead?
although we  we do also extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone could conceive or articulate. so 
you  you predicted that this would be in practice very bad. there are some jurisdictions that have the closely related test, are there not?
and you don't concede it.
yes. the action can be brought in state court and often is. there are about 50 reported decisions that we have found where the suit has been brought in state court. i haven't seen a particular pattern between the choice, but congress gave the option.
is that  i'm  and i'm mixed up. i thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.
your honor, we 
 this is so 
i would  i would compare the language of article 36(2) to any of the rights cases this court has decided. if i could, in my remaining minute, describe why  and this goes to the heart of what we were talking about with the procedural bar. if the question is, as justice breyer put it, whether pushing these claims to ineffective assistance is self-defeating, we have ample evidence here that it is. the state says, well, it may or may not be ineffective assistance. the state court said it wasn't ineffective assistance. that's because trial counsel doesn't have unique experience and knowledge necessary to make these decisions. that's why the treaty expressly puts it in the hands of the foreign national to make these decisions, not the lawyer. and, with respect, if  if  the state has asserted that we haven't raised an ineffective assistance claim. we did  we did recharacterize in the virginia supreme court, on pages  page 203, note 4 of the joint appendix, that if you wanted to flip all this on its head, you could certainly  you would certainly have to conclude that he created  that he committed ineffective assistance of counsel.
it absolutely did not come to grips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the alternative arguments that integra was presenting 
i think that a plaintiff would be able to handle that in  in a pleading and they would have to identify the leaks and if there are several, identify each of them and identify them as 
well, your honor, i guess to some extent it comes down to what intent means but if what it means that the doctors would prefer, would like it to come out as far as possible before they have to take any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing part, that's, that's what they intend. the doctor only uses disarticulation when it's necessary to clear an obstruction because the continued extraction 
it could be. but 
well, that's 
well, justice scalia, they didn't even do that in this ad, as has already been pointed out. and if they would have said find out what you can do to stop judicial filibusters, visit befair.org, and avoided a reference to senator feingold, they could have run this through their general treasury funds. but they couldn't resist the temptation to mention senator feingold in this context 
there are cases in which the merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those cases the district courts are fully empowered to make official factual findings.
i think the moral 
that's my understanding, as well. and this court has always held it's a federal question where legal incidence lies, and has not deferred  has given 
right.
why is it? it may be true. these pilgrims came for religious reasons. if all you have is a display of the origin of the law in the united states, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account? it's like teaching religion in the schools. of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the united states. you don't mean it religiously. you mean it historically.
i thought 
in a 
justice scalia, the implication of your argument is that a wrongdoer has no reasonable expectation in the law staying constant. but, of course, both the hughes aircraft and the landgraf decisions are cases in which a conduct was clearly illegal or unlawful at the time it was done, but, nonetheless, a change in the law would retroactively change the implications of that unlawful conduct. and this court, in both those cases, held that it was  that such change cannot be effected retroactively.
sorry.
in a different sense, yes. but the point is, the price discrimination does not occur when there is any competition. and, therefore, the requirements of the act are not satisfied.
well, general clement, what if we were to assume  i'm not saying this is  that the district court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had  say they made such findings. would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?
that's because the court explained the inadequacies it identified were present in the large fraction of cases. we don't know if that's true here.
no. that's  that's exactly correct.
of course, the defense argument was not focused on weaver either. the defense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for it. always fight for life, always, always. the argument by the defense wasn't  and it's hard for me to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't extend beyond the particular individuals.
i'm sorry.
this 
no, but i mean, that's at a level of generality that doesn't get us very far. i mean, what specifically did it disrupt? did it disrupt the parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?
yes, i  i understand that.
yes.
of course, you could say the same about  about any recovery, that a certain percentage in taxes will go to the federal treasury i  i 
 we're not operating in uncharted territory here. the rule that the ninth circuit has adopted has been the prevailing rule in the circuits for years. and i just want to clarify something that came up in the last argument, where i cited some very rough statistics about the numbers of cases. there's a rough  a rough cut at the universe of public employee free-speech cases, of which this type of case, where the speech is part of the job, is only a tiny subset. these cases are not dominating the courts, and you don't have all the litigation that is being 
well, two things, justice souter. i think, first of all, this case has come up postured as being about a choice between salerno and the large fraction test. and i think in some points, based on the way respondents have approached the case, that's become largely beside the point. at footnote 13 of their brief, they could not be more clear, that they are not here contending that the statute is invalid in a large fraction of their applications. they instead are embracing a per se rule that if the statute does not have a health exception or an emergency exception clear on its face, it is void in its entirety.
say that again. until 1966, official there were no statute of limitations against any government suits?
i  i waived the rule of reason argument with regard to showing market power and  and impact on the market. i chose ncaa under the footnote  and under footnote 39 of ncaa. and i chose price-fixing per se on the basis of citizens publishing.
that's correct. it was in the newspapers. but it was definitely covered, your honor. and that was more than a year before he brought his action. and then in addition, there were disclosures of allegations of performance bonuses being paid based upon falsified evaluations. that's ja 143. thank you.
well, it  it would do so in  in cases of  i guess, of the  the sorts of  of new proposed actions that require the  the corps to get into it in the first place. but i also assume that it would leave lots of  of water pollution regulation to the states. i don't see that it would displace the states.
sure.
but here we have, it seems to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been proven. that is what "equipoise" means. if aggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the equipoise finding is, "aggravators don't predominate. we cannot make that conclusion. we're right on the fence." and it seems to me that to call that a reasoned moral response  "we're on the fence, but execute anyway"  seems a total inconsistency.
 not asking for records, just asking for a statement about what they were going to do?
but  but i don't  but the reason why the court accepts errors in some situations is because there's some other value under the double jeopardy clause.
right. it does so in two places, your honor. on page 32 of their initial brief they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law from banning non- intact d&es. the first is the anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of an overt act. they describe the overt act as saving non-intact d&es that were not already excluded from the anatomical landmark requirement. so that suggests that there are some standard d&es that would not be saved by the anatomical landmark requirement. in addition, in their reply brief on page 22 they explicitly say that the fetus is usually not delivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard d&e, but they don't say that that never occurs. so they do admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact the government witness, doctor 
where did he go immediately after? he went to the school building for whatever it was, the third period of the day.
yes, your honor.
i think what i said is that the court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the  essential premise for the court's holding. at 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the  the decision, what the court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would have passed to alaska under the main clause, and that was one of the reasons the court, i think, held that it was covered by the proviso. no such concern is present here. i'd like at this point briefly to turn, if i might, to the count i, which is the historic waters count. there the united states asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by u.s. territorial waters. the historical record, though, belies that contention. at least from 1903 until 1971, the united states took what this court has described in the mississippi sound case, the alabama and mississippi boundary case, as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge. thereafter, the united states took  consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. what i mean by discriminatory is that the united states allowed u.s. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.
 duties.
and  and i think to answer that question, your honor, again we have to step back to the year 2000 and  pre-apprendi, et cetera. at that time, there were a series of cases, meggyesy, olney and rai, r-a-i, that  that are overturned, quite frankly, by the recuenco opinion, where the appellate courts had quite expressly said that it was sufficient to submit the deadly weapon verdict form in that form to a jury where it's clear that the only weapon at issue was a firearm. in each one of those cases, that was what was done. and in fact, in at least one of them, the victim was shot, so there couldn't be any question. so there was  there was a well-established practice in washington law at the time of proving that sort of thing. now, it's true that the more thorough practice, the more precise practice would have been to submit a verdict form that said firearm, but that wasn't done in this case, but it wasn't done, i believe, pursuant to those cases. unless the court has any additional questions, i'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
right.
i won't force you into that.
justice o'connor, congress, when it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of cost. it didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws of other nations or 
diversity is different, justice scalia, and here's why. when a case is removed on diversity grounds, the court of appeals  the district court is obliged to examine the bases of diversity. that is what the court's removal duty is. when a foreign sovereign removes a case, the district court's duty is to determine is this a foreign state within the meaning of the fsia. if it is, i have jurisdiction.
i would encourage the court to carefully look at what ms. maples was going to say. if you look in her own words, and i'm quoting: i was just in and out of the room. i just listened to bits and pieces of it. and that's at joint appendix 10. this, this witness may have been mr. hurtz's cousin, and not his ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but she did not have very much to say about this. she said she didn't hear the beginning of the statement. she could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion. she was in and out of the room. she heard only bits and pieces.
oh, oh. no, i mean of the witness.
well, your honor, if there's a loud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't have to be a hostage to that noise, and the police officers may be acting reasonably to do what is necessary to end that noise. but it's going to 
at least we know that in the probable world 
 appeal, but 
i think that not only do you know that the  this was clearly intended to be an anticipatory warrant as to the videotape, but it also authorized the search for other items that were related to 
yes. and boyde teaches that the way to do that is to look at the context of the entire case in conjunction with the  the instruction that was given in this case. and i want to start out that i  i agree with the state that the first thing this court should do is look at the instruction standing alone. and i want to indicate that without reference to the context of the case, the instruction standing alone does not support the inference that payton's post-crime evidence could be considered. now, i agree that in the context of the case, the context of the case could change that consideration. for instance, if the court, as this  some member of this court already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is to encompass payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor may have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and gentlemen, although it might not seem like payton's evidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in fact it can, then we would be left with a situation very similar to boyde where there really is no argument among counsel as to whether or not the evidence could be subsumed under (k). and that, in the context of that case, would permit it.
 why can't the government adopt my solution?
you mentioned the  the management agent and the  i think you mentioned the talent agent, and there was also mentioned the literary agent. the  the author is in the trade or business and gets to deduct all this off the top. there's no problem there.
i don't think so, your honor. i mean florida, in the state versus hamilton case, we official discussed in our brief, florida has defined curtilage narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that immediately surrounds the dwelling. and the case discusses a couple of cases from various florida courts of appeals where the courts construed the concept of curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling house, in another case a whiskey still that was a distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house, that those were too far out to be considered part of the curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds the dwelling that's associated with the intimate activities of the dwelling. so florida  and florida  and i think the court should take the florida supreme court at its word when it said it's going to strictly construe that concept, and when it said it's not going to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of burglary is. so i think the  so the first step, i think, if you don't  if you don't believe that the way florida defines burglary is generic in the way congress had in mind, i don't think you could conclude that it presents a categorically different set of risks such that it official would even fall outside the otherwise clause.
well, but the school has  the school has a program, an anti -drug program that shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers to preach against drug use and you're saying that  never mind unfurling a banner. you're saying that it has to let students contradict this message it's trying to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that says "smoke pot, it's fun."
well, he then goes; he tells you why. he says there is a dr. knorr who says you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease. and then another one says they are not considered appropriate candidates because of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera. so there's a list of medical situations where they couldn't use a fetal injection.
maybe he should have won. what's worrying me throughout, if you want to know 
 want to make sure what the calculus is, at the outset.
i would argue that, yes, it is all right to walk a dog around a house, but then as justice 
as a flat fee. what  what would the tax treatment of that be?
exactly. and one  one of the 
do we 
mr. kneedler, could 
you mean  you mean the noise stopped?
okay.
 mr. alioto 
with respect to first habeases.
so that solves that. the 
 better morale.
and that was a, that was one factor, however, justice stevens. i think, as i read that opinion, the court was also concerned with the fact that the, the per se rule which  and the court said the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the weyerhaeuser case  to the extent there's practices that can be procompetitive, the court should not set a low threshold of illegality, especially low per se illegality threshold. there were  there have been  it is worth emphasizing that the court has repeatedly said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a substantial body of economic experience that shows us that this practice 
that's  that's a little bit different from your, from your response to justice souter. you are making a much narrower argument. you, you don't
