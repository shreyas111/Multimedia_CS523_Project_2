defendant said 
mr. minear, you've indicated that in the first 8 months, when there was differential pricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits. i thought they shared the profits on some other basis.
that is true, justice ginsburg.
that's true, your honor. but if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court concluded that the multiple offender policy alone justified the exceptional sentence. the fact that the official defendant offender score for rape in the first degree is 16, thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the sentencing reform act standing alone, is a substantial and compelling reason and justification for imposing the exceptional sentence here."
it  it made an assumption.
if you have two water bodies, then you could have one discharging into the other. yes, your honor.
that depends on the instructions.
the  it would  the argument is in my favor, your honor, because this court should not read acts of congress in a manner that would render them absurd.
well, it might be common, but i'm not sure that's an acceptable kind of performance.
and then that would be so even if there were no affirmative obligation on the property owner.
no problem, your honor. the  the punch line to it is or to paraphrase it, you know, benefits are described as payments for medical  medical payments for this, that kind of thing. but there is a very specific description of what benefits means in the plan. it doesn't include reimbursement. and i  and i think it really stretches it to include reimbursement as a  under that benefit setting.
now, in your opinion is that constitutional?
well, there are  there are  there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the  but the basic 
 is preferable than the one i gave. would you adopt that or would you insist just that there be no stay and abey at all?
it had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? maybe more than that. i don't remember.
there's no question of  put aside a sandbagging case, there's no question of sandbagging, and that the  the state just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on the statute of limitations.
i think that would present a different question. as the government acknowledged, people who come into the country without inspection are entitled, under the government regulations, to the protections under zadvydas. and 
 does affect collateral estoppel.
now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim? the victim is canada. you collect congress  or canada's tax, and you give it to canada. is there any other kind of restitution?
justice scalia, if that 
thank you, mr. hungar. mr. phillips.
no, i do not. i think it was merely an application of the original opinion that relied upon the straight  state v. gregory, that in fact it must raise a reasonable inference as to the defendant's innocence.
yes.
your honor, i think it does, because there would have to be an allegation in that situation that bagels were being purchased on a religious basis, and that's going to be awfully hard for a lawyer to sign in good faith. i think the problem, if i may 
and what was the plaintiff's  it wasn't here. what kind of damages was he asking for?
mr. kissinger, you have 4 minutes remaining.
well, and i think it's an attractive nuisance. if that's the rule, if i can satisfy the rule by filing a lawsuit, i'm certainly encouraged to file a lawsuit regardless of whether there's underlying really market power or not because i  no one will ever  i won't have to worry about it. the burden will be shifted to my opponent.
for  for purposes of our probable  probable cause claim, yes.
do i  do i  does the government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction, 12(b)(6), no cause of action? of course, you'd probably do both, but i  i want to know 
not a defense. and the second question for me is that if there were a violation in district 23 of section 2, could it be cured by creating a district  the district farther to the east. i forget the number. 25 i guess it was. would that be a cure in your  in your judgment?
how could an indigent bring a 1983 case? i thought you said that that would be barred by younger.
if it's  if it doesn't go to the subject matter jurisdiction 
right. it wouldn't be an  but it would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles 
 patentee 
he was disabled 
well, justice scalia, i  all i have in  before me that i can rely on is the statute that congress enacted. your point would cover, of course, equally, the donning and doffing in steiner itself. congress made some choices about things that were going to be compensable. it's worth noting that congress drew a line about whether  in terms of whether there was a collective bargaining agreement involved, because under section 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a collective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of at least clothes changing. but i think within the framework of the statute that we do have, i am actually quite correct, and that is, right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt an efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing. they can put things in different buildings if they like. the employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes waiting for different clothing at different times, depending on how long the lines are. it is a workable scheme that congress designed that said, "we're going to have a workday." and the employer is in charge of deciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that workday, they're going to have to pay. i did want to 
maybe that's why we don't allow banners, because a courtroom is not the place for banners.
is part or all of the objectives of both the  the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?
that is correct.
that is what this court's decisions say, chief justice roberts. i think i want to make clear that we have two different positions on that. the first is that any state court decision finding this argument in its totality based on what happened and based on the weight of the evidence in this case that said that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally unfair would be an unreasonable application of darden and donnelly. but in addition to that, the missouri supreme court in this case said the decision was unreasonable because it failed to consider significant portions of mr. weaver's challenge to this argument. it did the analysis under a state law abuse of discretion standard, and it refused to consider or failed to consider several components of his claim.
well, i think 
well, i thought at its core it was about this rule that the ninth circuit adopted about closely related offenses. i thought at its core that's what we were concerned with.
to answer your question, the government takes these types of allegations seriously. it's taken seriously at the line level at the bureau of land management. it's taken seriously within the department of interior and it's taken seriously at the department of justice.
i think that's correct.
but could the nature of the additional crimes themselves satisfy it? in other words, could the judge say, well, all three  it might be one thing if one were serious and the other two were trivial, but all of these three are very serious. now, that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of official discrete fact. could that value judgment satisfy the extraordinary criterion that washington says there must be in addition to free crime.
thank you, mr. feldman. mr. fisher, you have three minutes remaining.
that's right.
well, it may mean something in a different context, i think an example you could use would be the arbitrary trademark of "apple" for computers. there could be advertising for computer electronics, incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school rush, using the term "apple" in a descriptive sense: "apples for teachers," you know, the beginning of the year, "come to our store." so, in reliance on that, you drive two hours because you're the school district director who needs to buy ten new computers to hook into the system. you get there, it turns out they're not apple computers.
yes.
well, why not? it says calculated. it may be. now, you tell me why it's so remarkable because i think i could take judicial notice of what life is like for most families in the world today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.
why, if  you may answer.
 you'd have to go to trial.
 contrary 
it just says that it's for someone else to decide the second prong of the naruc test, which is, should you be compelled? okay? the congress doesn't decide that. it's crazy to think that congress decided, forever and ever and ever, that everybody who came in would be a common carrier, no matter what the market looked like. congress, instead, took the world as it came, and it relies on the fcc to decide whether you should be compelled, under the second prong of naruc, to be a common carrier. they have declined, in this case, to extend that to us. that, i would say, is  you know, that's entitled to the utmost deference. it's a  deciding not to extend their own rules. and there are perfectly fine reasons for that. the reasons that pushed them to do it in 1980 to the telephone companies, about cross-subsidies, have no application to us. and the discrimination justifications back then, when there was only one platform, had no application to us. now, you may say, is this an odd result that it comes out differently at the end? well, it is, and it is being dealt with. the fcc is in the process of reconsidering, in the wireline order, wireline nprm, whether it still makes sense to use computer ii to impose a common-carrier obligation, an obligation to do it separately, to provide the communications separately, on the telephone companies. if they decide that no longer is the case and that they don't have to provide it separately, and the telephone companies stop doing that, they will no longer fall within the definition of "telecommunications service" under the statute. in other words, the statute asks, what are you, in fact, doing? okay? there are two ways you could be providing it separately: if you choose to it or if you're forced to do it. we've done neither. the telephone companies have been forced to do it. congress has  and they've decided we shouldn't be forced to do it, and they're entitled to deference on that.
it was overturned in ring, your honor. but when you had lower court appellate judges looking at your decision in apprendi and seeing the fact that walton and apprendi were consistent, it official was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every single court did except for kansas, that the definition of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory maximum that was in apprendi.
we don't have any first circuit numbers 
and i don't see how it's relevant to go in at sentencing and say, "oh, but there are all these doubts." i mean, by finding "beyond a reasonable doubt," there isn't a reasonable doubt left.
not necessarily not applicable to state prosecutors. however, in the context of fundamental fairness, does it establish a clear  a rule in the sense of those kinds of statements will render a trial fundamentally 
but, your honor, it's not required to present it that way. and i think what's incorrect about your phrasing is, it was petitioners that did not present this. it was the same petitioners last time. they presented to this court the questions as to the meaning of "extortion" and whether injunctions were permissible under civil rico. in fact, if you look at page 397 of your prior decision, it clearly states that there were two issues presented, what "extortion" means under the hobbs act and whether injunctions are permissible under civil rico. i think it was completely appropriate, then, for respondents to say this court didn't deal with the four issues in  concerning whether violence and threats of violence are separately from the hobbs act. and it was then permissible to say to the seventh circuit, "these remain as a basis for relief."
thank you, ms. kirkland. ms. rivkind.
yes. however, the jury was also told that it was their discretion to spare his life at appendix 275.
you're representing the attorney general of california, and you have a lot of litigation in the ninth circuit. it's  i mean, the other side's going to answer on the merits, if they can. and they're in an awkward position here, i understand. but i need to know what to  what do you think we should do? i mean, here, we write an opinion, and they 
 in rasul.
13501 deals just with ssrs.
that's 
are there  are there any manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?
 "a known right."
but that class of activities could be  could be  if this court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the court, that class 
can't they be 
if  if it works the same way with slusa, such could be the law. the court certainly has the opportunity to clarify that. again, i'll return to the simpler way 
in matlock 
well, they can do all those things, but they don't have the benefit of the  of sovereign immunity.
well, but it certainly thought that the fda considers only safety, and nothing else, that it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the government and the petitioner for what is exempt preclinical trial information.
as i understand the government's position, you're not merely questioning standing but you also take the position you do not have the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do; is that correct?
i have just one other question that, it's generally related to the first. if there is substantial evidence that other procedures or alternate procedures are available, alternate to d&x, alternate to intact d&e, is your response that, although they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of, of medical expertise, they are not available because hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted? i was going to ask that same question to the government, because there is some indication in the record that certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this purpose, which is  goes back to my earlier question. i was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.
 that it will get there and it will be properly delivered. that's the  the purpose of the certification.
yes, your honor.
well, this same limitation, justice scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any court said any state or federal court and the exclusion said any state or federal court. it's consistent 
yes.
all right. what is it?
but they still didn't stop. i  i read somewhere in the facts that only gradually, as each participant in the melee became aware of his presence, did they sort of stop. it wasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieted down immediately.
i notice the court applied it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique circumstances.
that is correct, your honor, and then i would have to look for an evaluation of forum non conveniens that was favorable to the client. that was one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the third circuit; and the court did not make a ruling on that.
i mean, it just  it's almost question-begging. it's peculiar.
yes. in arizona, the burden was placed on the defendant, was it not 
ms. millett, there are many lawyers in congress and at least the law students of my generation  some of them are of that elder age. we learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another. this is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it. another reason why i would expect a congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign. unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many  and  and we have all this whole line of cases. is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's. but this, which came about only because of the merger of two statutes, one saying federal and state, the other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all these anomalies that have been brought out. shouldn't we say to congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in foreign?
the obvious reason to do it is, i guess you have an area of the country, let's say, which is quite clean in the air. and there is a power official plant. and what somebody works out, which is normal, is demand for electricity is increasing. and so what we will do is we're going to take these turbines and system, and we're going to change it really radically. it doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 12 hours a day. so there's going to be twice as much pollution in the air. now the whole idea of the psd system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the air, and i guess that's why they wanted to do it.
well, they  they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating. and we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is  that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses. but jurors say, well, you know, this  this just is not important is what they're saying.
where does it say that?
well, within  within the eighth amendment jurisprudence of  of the evolution of  of eighth amendment jurisprudence, we've seen hanging go by the wayside. we've effectively seen electrocution go by the wayside. as we advance as a society and as we advance within our knowledge of what's going on 
thank you 
well, but that  that simply says if the  it seems to me you're simply saying there would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather than the other. and  and you may well be right about that, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt standard.
let  let me ask you this. suppose the law enforcement official  the postal inspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor because of their disagreement with his first amendment views. the prosecutor said, i don't care about the first amendment views. i'm glad you brought this to me. i'm going to prosecute because there's probable cause here and this is a bad actor. what results?
mr. dreeben, could i bring you back to the  the issue? i'm sorry. yes. can i bring you back to the issue of whether the court that recognizes the right has to be the supreme court or not? you say there are three other instances in which it is specified that it be the supreme court, and it's not specified here. but does any of those other three instances involve language like this which  which has the supreme court mentioned immediately previously? i mean, when i read that the first time, has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases, i mean, i think what it envisions is the  the very decision of the supreme court that newly recognized it made it retroactively applicable. is  is any of the other ones phrased this way so that the word, the supreme court, is immediately preceding the and made retroactively applicable?
even though if  if  do you concede that if he had, for example, refused the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel action, he would have to go through the statutory procedures before bringing that  the constitutional claim on review of those administrative procedures?
i mean, there were references to the primary inducement to the federal government's entering into the treaty being the desire to 
what 
i think  congress has certainly defined the estate so that a preferential transfer is considered property. i'm not sure that congress can do that when the preferential transfer involves the estate. that strikes me as the effect of congress, in effect, saying that property which clearly belongs to the state no longer does. i think that's probably an affront to tenth amendment federalism concerns. but what we do have here is a situation where, like in a breach of contract claim, they are trying to recovery a monetary judgment in order to augment the estate. it's our position that that is barred by sovereign immunity.
well, i'm not sure that's 100 percent true. i think the real problem with the second circuit is there's no monolithic second circuit rule that's out there. the second circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b) prior to the time congress adopted the strong inference standard. some of them  i think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in shields versus citytrust bank, for instance. the way judge jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case. so if you 
yes.
it's a fact that the statute says both. it is a constitutional fact. i certainly concede that. justice ginsburg, i believe i did not answer  i'm sorry.
yes, and maybe you don't have a claim at the beginning of the case. i mean, that's what we're getting at. we can understand the claim when the note  when you've got a promissory note and you're out of money. the claim is inevitable. in this case, there is no inevitable claim.
if i understand your question correctly, the second of them might better be called allowing competing viewpoints.
yes, but in mcconnell 
i thought judge gertner said she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police report. it wasn't attached to the charge. i thought that was her position, that these are untested documents. we don't know one way or another whether the judge that accepted the plea had seen them.
well, the context is he got off a boat. we couldn't  but cuba won't take him back or  or whatever  wherever he came from. they can't. and the only thing we can do to keep him out of the country is to keep him in jail.
it's not printed?
if they're only providing it for free and not barring you 
well, the jury does have to find equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt. but the fact remains that the jury is making that decision of equipoise, which requires the death sentence, without having made the individualized sentencing determination required at the selection stage under the eighth amendment. and that's the problem with the equipoise provision, because it allows the jury to avoid making that decision, which is 
is it really billions? how many of these have been certified as class actions?
may ask you this question, mr. bopp? this  in  following up on justice ginsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no set of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and so on, watergate and all the rest of it, could ever justify an expenditure limit?
let me ask you a question about that. your argument depends  you analogize  you would agree, i take it, that if this was an oversecured, secured creditor they'd be entitled to fees?
i believe it definitely would have been something new, your honor.
the  the officer knows 
why isn't the type of documentation that would be sufficient? he understands what the consequence of not putting mitigating evidence on is going to be.
well, that's the facts that we had in this case. and your analysis there again will  will hinge on whether or not  in mississippi admittedly murder would be a lesser-included offense if the facts support it and also manslaughter. but now, if you apply the federal standard 
 it doesn't come  it doesn't come within the federal constitution.
thank you, mr. ott. the case is submitted.
if it's  if it's a blue collar worker and it's  it's not part of their responsibility and they sometimes eat together in the lunchroom or not, that would not be. however, if it is a 
your honor 
no, they did not, and  and the utah supreme court recognized that.
but the question is do you have to knock and announce when, on the facts before you, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and it will just be a wasted gesture.
 of federal law.
but he was never  never charged with the impersonating an officer, only with the flashing headlights. is that right?
well, this brings me to my last point about this particular sentencing, which is that in this very case judge jackson looked at the defendant. she said, candidly i don't know really very much about you other than what i've learned about in the presentence report and i can't tell whether you're unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a wakeup call and nothing more. what she ignored is his own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine, that he was arrested and placed into the state system, put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you, we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate with your family, and what did the defendant do but get caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack. and on that record  and this is what the court of appeals said  there's a disconnect between the judge's conclusion that, with little information more than what she had in the psr, the kid deserved leniency versus the fact that he had already had that chance and he had not 
no, your honor.
it wasn't sovereign immunity. it was  charities had immunity until very recently. some states still had it when i was in law school. you couldn't sue a charity for tort.
no, your honor.
would a  i'd like you to elaborate a little because, as i understood your claim, particularly in response to justice stevens, you agree that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for it somewhere else. you agree they can't make up for it particularly when their only way is for political reasons. but your argument is they never violated  that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.
is that better, your honor?
 why did you answer justice scalia's question as you did? that is also an employee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness.
well, he's given notice that he's approaching the border with intent to commit this crime.
you may. general hood.
 the concert master and the  the  all the orchestra players and everyone else are covered by the jones act even though, by the way, none of them has ever moved whatsoever.
and that isn't the question.
 for balisok in that case.
well, i  i don't mean to interrupt, but it is true that this is a civil action that's brought under 3730(h), is it not?
i mean, maybe their right about beards and mustaches.
i think what it means  i understand, justice scalia, and i  because i've had the same reaction, "well, of course he could. why does he need a statute to do that? it is a cost of doing business." i think that provision is a part of the effort to make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this case from the chickasaw nation case, where the court found that it was significant that the distributor was required to pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the retailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission. so, this court thought that might be significant. kansas, in part, i think, want to make  wanted to make it very clear that the  what was happening in the economic chain is cost of production of gasoline, including tax paid by the distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of business to the retailer. now, of course its cost  it passed on, also, to the consumer. the question 
we're still, it would seem to me  i don't know  the warrant wasn't dependent on the initial entry? you could also say the initial entry wasn't the product of the  of the later warrant.
what  what about the courts below the florida supreme court? didn't they rule on it?
which is 
let me just clear up one thing to be 100 percent sure i understand your position. it does  the message is the critical part of this case. if it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot sign, that would be okay. you're not saying 15-foot signs are disruptive?
thank you, mr. long. mr. niver, we'll hear now from you.
in fact, in this case he did not. and while the record is rather sparse on this, the mortgage company paid the taxes for 30 years. after the mortgage was retired, mr. jones thought that the occupant, mrs. jones, was paying the taxes. he was mistaken in that belief and that's what happened here.
so, everything turned on the nominal-party finding.
okay.
i think that  i also want to make the point, of course, that there was a factual finding, so if this court did conclude, it would have to find the trial court was clearly erroneous. the 
i would think you'd take 
so this instruction should not have been given.
so why was there a need for a second call when exactly that happened?
yes, there would be  there would be those sorts of restrictions. my only point is that the first amendment is not addressed to speech or writing that an employee undertakes in the  in the  in the course of his official duties. this 
 the wheels of justice grind slowly  sometimes they do, but they  the key point here is, look at what happens if the hearing officer denies services the child needs. the child is going to be harmed, and, in the long run, society is going to be harmed, as this court recognized in rowley. the harm to the child if the burden is erroneously  excuse me  the harm 
and then  and then the riverboat  it depends on how  how permanently it's affixed to the land. suppose it stays there for 10 years. it  it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.
the reason is  is because if you  if you lower the prima facie case so that it's meaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to do is find a selection practice  because it's always going to correlate with age  it means you shifted the burden to an employer in every case to establish that its  its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing the eeoc might come up with later, justice breyer. meanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my clients will do is as follows. they will say, well, you know, we're not going to wait to see if  if this new practice we're going to consider is going to stand the test of time in court and under the eeoc's yet-to-be-articulated regulation. we're going to stick with the tried and true. we are not going to innovate at all, and if we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the numbers while we do it. the employers 
the  if your damage  harms to and from the mail, yes. yes, that is our position. if he mows 'em down with his arm or with his rearview mirror on his truck, your  the liability attaches. but you asked why it is important, justice breyer. and one of the reasons it's very important is to look at these types of claims. the postal service is defenseless. we are essentially defenseless when we get one of these claims. unlike a vehicle accident, where we are a party to it and know what happens when it happens, this type of injury, we may not know about for up to two years after 
that's right. and the question, of course, is, what does "all" refer to here? and i would say, if you go back to page 399, it lists the predicate acts that it's referring to and there 
justice souter, if they are segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they don't  for those for whom they don't receive affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy the statute in  in that way. but what, what the statute says as interpreted by the trial court, if then the union puts those funds back into its general treasury, or even if it doesn't, and spends them in some way for some purpose whatever, that it's violating the statute. and the only way that the union can comply is by not only segregating the funds, but then if affirmative authorization is not received, by rebating a certain portion of the fund to the individual fee payers.
no, it did not, but that did occur in the barcellos & wolfsen litigation that ran between 1978 and 1980.
so what do they mean by it?
yes, a duty to return the death penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the law.
why isn't it the denial of an element of the claim? there's no recovery for assault if the mental element is what the chief justice just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an element of the claim how do you draw a distinction between that and the existence or nonexistence of any act at all.
but what the  what the united states is doing is responding to this classic collective-action problem by establishing a government program to meet the situation where the industry, itself, will  is unable to conduct the advertising because of  because of, what i said, the fungibility of the product 
yes, your honors, at page 41 of the brief. it would be the  the second paragraph where they examine double-celling only after initial screening. and also note 13 of the trulson study indicates that it did not apply in texas' equivalent of california's reception centers. the turner standard is the appropriate standard here because it does give the prison officials 
okay. the booking occurs after arrest, and i thought what we were concerned with in this case was the validity of the arrest, not the booking.
mr. meczyk, i assume that your answer to whether it's lawful to have a  a dog at a bus depot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming off, without stopping them, but just  just to have the dogs there, that's unlawful.
yes, she did, your honor, but her ultimate opinion was couched in the language of tennessee's statutory mitigating circumstance, that  that mr. thompson at the time of the offense suffered from a mental illness or defect that  that impaired his ability to  to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, but that was not sufficient to meet the legal definition of insanity. that is the  that is the  exactly the language under tennessee's mitigator that  that dr. sultan's opinion was specifically limited to.
certainly, your honor 
you can answer it.
respectfully, if we were to lose, and if medellin were to prevail, his position could potentially open the door to the reconsideration of the over 100 foreign nationals that are on death row across this country, and, beyond that, to thousands 
it sounds to me like 
was that later?
that is 
but, as you say, it's  in a way, it's  in a sense, it comes in through the back door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent to kill a  make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it be admissible?
but, justice ginsburg, he doesn't need to know which four. what he needs to determine is, did the record that was presented to the jury support the finding that there were four acts of violence and threats of violence? and we'd suggest that 
and so, the state 
yes. most certainly. because 
that would be  well, depending on how many people it takes in that particular district to elect a candidate of choice. in this case it was 63 percent. it might be a different number for a different district. but your 
so let's say if  if the flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they don't know about it, then if they  if they broadcast it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?
what's the effect of the constitutional provision then?
well, isn't it required to do that under your title, if you're going to have your title set aside by jones?
do you have a case, do you have a case i can look to that tells me that?
but if you filed  so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?
it's from an additional 
what if  what if this had been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the sole count, and  and the same ruling had been made by the judge? would you say that there was double jeopardy attaching or not?
yes.
that's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides. and then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case i've ever heard, but i do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff. and that would be the weak evidence standard. and lo and behold, that could be  you know, what do we do about that? because using your do you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the weak inference and not the strong inference. and what i'm driving at is, i don't see a way of avoiding this seventh amendment problem.
that sentence by itself 
no. suppose there's a primary where it works that they can get on the ballot. suppose we're looking at the general election.
what about mr. dreeben's parting challenge? what are you going to do if your client gets 10 years? you're going to argue that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, right?
 the act is implicated.
in this case, they  they claim not to want to violate it in the future. they're just talking about, you know, the  the past actions should  should be compensable by damages and not  they should not be subjected to a very threatening injunction.
so what's the test? the test is either a high statistical number of injuries or if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high statistical number of injuries? i like the word nexus because whenever i see it in an opinion, i have no idea what it means. (laughter.)
okay.
 that depends on what we say. i'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at your answer to justice o'connor, indicating that it happens all the time where there are two occupants, and one expressly says, "you can't come in," and they do anyway. but leaving that aside, it seems to me that most of the considerations that would impel a decision in your favor can be answered under other doctrines. if there's cocaine that's being used and may be destroyed, there's exigent circumstances. i don't see the necessity for the rule that you propose.
no, because this is government funding. this is 
well, did we say that in the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of childhood abuse and so forth?
and that right, where  where is that right contained? you have given us citations for the other ones. where is that right contained?
okay.
 by georgia.
and you argued that specifically? and so your problem  i guess that you said that. i mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on page 6.
well, it was a much longer timeframe than that. there was testimony that they went back to town, and went to the father's house and obtained weapons before they went to the house where the homicides occurred. the other issue is that there has been subsequent evidence, since the first trial. these codefendants have recanted certain statements. they have recanted 
well, that  it's to preserve the statute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is something narrower than the conviction, then the interest of repose sets in. and, i mean, the other side has, you know, the same point  it's if you draw it out broad enough 
well, but you would argue that the same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs, you had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring a bell or something whenever the odor of  of narcotics was present, wouldn't you?
why.
no.
and don't take the one i just suggested because i'm not sure that's right. what is your response?
 functional equivalent of an 
the health of the woman, would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth problems that you bring up? because then after we say to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way. official if you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about overbreadth fade?
the doors are open, they're not closed.
your honor, when epa regulated lead back in the ethyl days, as the court court itself took note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at that time. and epa has a lot of discretion in evaluating that, that uncertainty. and if the epa determined that the level of uncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to anticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate. it would also be appropriate if the agency determined that there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't even form a judgment on that. that would be applying the endangerment statute at the same time it put off. but the point is they did not say any of that. they instead relied on impermissible grounds.
well, don't  don't appeal to them on a  on a point on which you don't agree with them. i mean 
i'm not an expert on the clean water act. is that a proper clean water act standard?
so, that doesn't contribute anything to the dialogue.
 my hypothetical. [laughter.]
well, you prevented him from filing effectively. i mean 
you don't want the burden? don't take the money. i mean, they  they do that all the time.
okay.
there is this talk about lessened 
yes, that his lawyer misled him was the first claim, that by telling him he'd be out in 10 to 15 years.
and  and what i'm trying to point out, your honor, is that there may very well be class actions where it's not different. there may be some when  where it is if it's the case that there's no contractual obligations to pay the fee  pay the fee between the class member and the attorney, and if it's the case that the class member really exerts no meaningful control over the  over the attorney's fees portion 
suppose that we concluded  well, i don't want to cut you off. go ahead, please. if i cut you off.
he's in a criminal trial, and what he wants 
but amount in controversy is in 1332. congress putting it right there together. it says diversity of citizenship plus amount in controversy, all in 1332. here the limit appears in a statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.
as  on the first step, yes.
it's not for deciding whether removal  i thought the statute says that the attorney general's certification is conclusive with respect to removal.
may i answer it this way? i know i'm supposed to say yes or no and then  (laughter.)
gave equilon and to motiva. if they gave them independence to make their own judgment  maybe equilon would like to make texaco a lower price. maybe it like to make it a  a discounter.
i thought a comparative advantage of the solicitor general's approach, and, by the same token, of the petitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a lot of litigation over a collateral issue, like which court you ought to be in. as soon as you get into a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on both sides arguing their factors and the other side's factors, and the judge has to decide. if there's a presumption that applies in most cases, you don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles like this.
 is the law 
i don't believe they do, your honor. i think the terms of opm and blue cross' contract provide that blue cross will enter into a  a contract with the  with the policyholders that is consistent with its contract with opm. but i don't  i don't believe  and  and honestly, i  i did not look before we  we talked about this. i don't believe it requires their approval. they don't get a copy of the contract and read it over.
 that entity no longer has standing. there are still property taxpayers, but that 
thank you, mr. laurence. mr. gold, you have four minutes remaining.
it is an intangible sequence of commands that is carrying 
well, you did say the  these contracts were unique.
well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues. can you tell me, is the  is there a new york state excise tax on alcohol?
it was probably not a very precise history, justice stevens. i do think one can read markham, however, especially if one reads it in the context of the cases it cites for its principles, to hold what we are saying now, which is that federal courts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters, that is, no jurisdiction to probate a will. and its interference language, i believe, was its statement of the in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in fact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at all.
on the face of the complaint, we agree that they're not preempted. our only position is by the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided that they had no evidence on what would have been non-preempted claims. if another farmer wants to bring an expert that says strongarm can be manufactured 
not necessarily, because it does give you a vehicle to go back to the old chapter 7 case and do the procedural claims objections in that case, which is what we did, and we substantially reduced the total of the claims.
 what's at issue 
i disagree, your honor. i do not think that the duty to cooperate necessarily included the duty to include the state in the loop in the settlement process.
if it fits, it's because of some cases. so  because this whole area, 1981, didn't take off until runyon against mccrary. so we're starting with what? 1976. so to  to flesh out what that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of this court when you talk about dignitary damages.
 because they had 
well, that's good.
no, and 
well, but he knew about that. he knew about that mitigating evidence at the trial because his biological mother was there.
can  can we go back to the  another threshold question? you did press below and judge tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in the district court in california, or wherever, is it has to be in the federal circuit. this is a contract claim against the government. are you abandoning that position?
if the computer malfunctions, that's a fourth amendment violation?
mr. kaplan?
in fact 
nathanson is the  you cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition?
 that says that, "a valid death-penalty statute must provide sufficient narrowing" 
no. it was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.
there is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for official purposes of removal, the attorney general's certification is conclusive. and it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in federal court rather than be immediately remanded without the availability of review.
thank you, counsel. mr. kise.
 with the text. i think you have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if it's just the text, that's not my question.
i wish we could get some new vocabulary. terminology is destiny, and i really don't follow the discussion of speaking about whether it was prospective or retroactive. i don't think, whichever way it applied, it is retroactive. but the issue still remains, did congress intend pre-iirira reentries to be covered or not? i 
your honor, in an equal-partnership argument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated the proceeding to ask for the goal that congress had in mind 
all right. but what you're hearing is, "so what? he was a dealer whose line of business was to purchase volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a commodity  namely, volvo trucks."
so it's clear that they disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive. is anything clear beyond that? i mean, i guess i'm hesitant to say i'm raising the same question that the chief justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court did. i mean, there's no question that they found that the  the state trial court's finding with respect to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not necessarily dispositive. i don't think it's clear that they found anything beyond that, but correct me if i'm wrong.
no, and you have put your finger on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. we know that for a couple of reasons. the first is that there has been a detailed rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities charged by congress with implementing the ada have spent quite some time. they have produced this single-spaced, half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making 
very hard to define.
then why don't you bring it? i mean, the answer to the  to the statutory point, it seems to me, is you've got your assignment. if you're not whole yet, sue.
well 
well, your honor, it would certainly be a big deal to california. but more importantly, if this court were to say that a reasonableness constraint reinvokes the sixth amendment, you would be basically throwing into doubt the way booker has reformed the federal system as well, because 
why not?
there would be no lower court decision.
it depends on how fast  if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway. all those factors come into, into account. and it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers. there's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself. it's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't you think? i wouldn't have done it if i was scott.
see, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem  provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.
so that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.
you're not sure that the good samaritan doctrine is the  is necessarily what the arizona law would be  what the analog would be.
how much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at? how many buildings will have to be rented to store those documents and how many years will be expended in, in gathering all the materials?
no, not solely.
just because you're going to lose doesn't mean that he's not a real party.
yes.
well, do you take  i'm sorry, i can't think of the name of the case. you know the case that i'm talking about with the footnote?
okay.
if the question is one of the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error question rather than a question of whether the jury can give it effect?
was that happening when epa took the opposite view? was there this tremendous disparity with juries going every which way 
i wonder what that means. suppose that the treaty provides that if the individual sends a letter to the counsel, they have to deliver it. doesn't it?
mr. flaxman, before you save your time, i didn't understand why you're content with justice breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind that the way he put it is, so long as the  as the criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute of limitations, how does that help you when the statute of limitations has passed? then there's no tolling.
our claims are alive. there are claims there that seek relief 
they used the word "effectiveness," which is pretty close. [laughter.]
yes, but if you've got to show the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss. i mean, if you've got to show the  the drop following the inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action if there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.
pro se.
but the court's decisions aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. i'd make two points in that regard. first of all, in one sense this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary can't engage in federally authorized activities unless and until it gets the state's permission. so at least there is a prohibition at the outset. but more importantly, the court's cases aren't limited to situations involving prohibitions of the sort that your honor posits, because in the franklin national bank case that was a situation in which the national bank had the power to accept savings deposits and the state law that was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the national bank from accepting savings deposits.
but their claim was that the spending of this entire grant is unconstitutional because of the way the money is going to be used by the grantees. it wasn't that $1.98 of the is unconstitutional and the other million dollars is okay. it was that because of the way the grantee was using the money, the entire grant is unconstitutional. we think that's a different case.
but isn't there evidence in  i noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call our attention to the statute that prohibits the euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a certain procedure. so there must have been a legislative feeling that unless that procedure were followed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and cats. why isn't there a similar basis for believing that if you don't follow a similar procedure that such a risk might be present for human beings?
her permission wouldn't extend to that room, would it?
no, you won't, but it makes perfect sense 
i don't  i don't understand. if we were to take that, wouldn't we have to overturn smith? you think not. you just said not. but as i  then as i understand smith, we look to (b) and (b) says, plaintiff, you cannot bring an action under anything. okay? you can't bring a state tort law action. you can't bring an action under federal law against the employee, with certain exceptions where you can like bivens and where there's a specific statute. then we have over here the exceptions section. and over here in the exceptions section, it says there is no federal action for, among other things, the case in front of us and, among other things, actions in a foreign country. and so the court says, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't bring it under federal tort claims act, and now we'll go look to see whether this bar that you can't bring it, period, applies. they say it does apply. now, justice stevens dissented, but he didn't dissent on that ground. and  and so  so i don't see how we could reach the result with this other exception without overturning smith because smith said (b) does apply. and so if the fact that it falls within an exception means the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would have held (b) doesn't apply. but they said (b) does apply. so how do we get there given smith?
i didn't understand one of your answers. supposing that today the management does not know of the prior discrimination. just, records that have been lost, it happened a long time ago. but there was evidence that there was a firm policy that women get 20 percent less than men forever and it's still  that policy has continued up to date, but that these people making the decision today did not know that. would there be liability or not?
 that it's not a legal entity. and then other associations.
justice stevens, the legislative history  there certainly was some indication that the legislature did not want a general health exception. there is no indication in the legislative history that the legislature intended to preclude this narrow category of cases which constitute emergency cases short of that.
well, what if we think that's not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty plea? there was some cross examination. there was some participation. so if we don't accept your statement that it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we employ for the tacit consent or the failure to affirmatively respond?
let me take that distinction and apply it to the vehicle, justice scalia. what we have to have to authorize deadly force in this context is something more than just unsafe flight. you've got to have someone who is behaving violently, who is menacing people, trying to ram people.
 in 2679(b)?
could i ask you just one thing?
okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true. the current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents. but is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the ten commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text?
well, i think what you do is decide the federal issue, which i think is whether they were correct in the legal proposition that they asserted.
my response is in two parts. first of all, your honor, i agree with you that exhaustion can be a tricky issue, but it's  it's the most tricky in the question about whether or not the question has been fairly presented. the less tricky portion of the question is whether or not the claim is unexhausted, having been  that means there's an available remedy in state court. the easy way to sort that out is just to file your claim in state court. if there is in fact an available remedy, then you get tolling, and that solves the problem. i 
that no factfinder  and this is mixed fact and law  could reasonably come to that conclusion.
well, did he use 
can you give  i'm  i'm not sure i understand the dispute. can you give me in  in  without using up all of your time, a  basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions?
 just construing 
you think it could be either.
i think on race alone, the prison system would run afoul of the constitution in making that determination. if it  if race were analyzed in the context of gang membership, as part of an overall analysis of proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts existing in that prison, particularized circumstances, as suggested in the lee case, i think that would be a proper analysis and constitutional. it's 
 referring back to hypothetical 
do they have standing in state court?
in the respondents' brief on page 18, they acknowledge that the traditional test has been hydrological connection, that that's what they have looked towards.
that seems to me really to go back on  on scheiner. and i thought we tried to get away from deciding commerce clause questions on the basis of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce, you know, the original package doctrine and things that succeeded it. and you're  you're just dragging back in this  this inquiry into whether it's really interstate or  or rather local.
now, it may mislead the jury if that's all you say. but as a matter of analyzing the statute or even of analyzing what the court meant in rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that official would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis; isn't that so?
so imagine you're a juror and you think to yourself, i see all this stuff about the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his dangerousness, i think he's dangerous, and i also think he did it deliberately. and then you think to yourself, well, could i consider it because it shows a bad childhood and that is deserving of a life term? i'm not sure it shows me that, but can i consider it for that purpose at all? what's my answer under texas law?
no, but if you can give me a yes or no answer, give me a yes or no answer.
absolutely, justice scalia. and if you read the securities industries amicus brief, it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are caused by allowing  too much of the private litigation is precisely that, which congress was responding to.
and what if he does talk to the prison guard and the guard says i don't know, i don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's in the warden's office, or something like that. what is the prisoner supposed to do?
all right. if that is correct, why do we not give some deference to the conclusion of the trial court that this was not voluntary?
the means wasn't right. no knock-and-announce.
it has notice. it's involved, et cetera, et cetera.
well, you mean the court has  every court faced with this problem is supposed to decide, in that particular case, who has the burden?
in the context of powers expressly conferred upon the states by the twenty-first amendment, that's an exception to the operation  the normal operation of the dormant commerce clause. commerce clause has to be read in light of the twenty-first amendment, just as the twenty-first amendment has to be read in light of the commerce clause and other provisions of the constitution.
but you said, in this case 
that's certainly right. these are all things that would apply, we would expect, both to a civil action in court and an administrative-agency action, as well. they may work better for one or the other in different particular circumstances, but they are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both circumstances. and the one the government, in the administrative context, would be most interested in would be subsection c. when the government just doesn't know the facts, or the government reasonably couldn't know the facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it reasonably could have known of the fact. and that's just as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be in an action before a court. in addition, the government's contrary official construction renders an entire provision superfluous. and that is the one that justice scalia mentioned, section 2415(i), which is an exception for administrative offsets. that exception for administrative offsets would do no work at all if 
so, it's sort of a double inconsistency. not only do you treat state  state actions that are  that are minimal  i'm sorry, where the state treats it more seriously than the federal government, not only do you follow the state, but, where the state treats it less leniently than the federal official government, you also follow the state.
 to give up his rights.
thank you, justice stevens.
i think that's correct.
and you think that the indictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a substantial step, but presenting the documents might have been, whether it was walking up, presenting the documents, lying to the agent? you have to go into that level of detail in order to satisfy the fifth amendment?
thank you. mr. himmelfarb, we'll hear now from you.
in other words, you know, you put a gun to the person's head and say, sign this contract, and the person does. it contains an arbitration clause. they don't have to go to arbitration to challenge that.
 at 10(a) in the appendix, has received the fuel, if he subsequently loses the fuel  has it lost or burned  gets a refund of the tax, if it's  if that happens before he uses, sells, or delivers.
oh, i see what you're saying.
now, have you got anything  - i've heard you argue about the word "discharge"; and you say "discharge" doesn't mean "discharge of water," it means something else. and i think that's a very logical argument. is there any other argument that you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for the objective?
well, it has to be final before you can file a petition for cert.
i don't think so, your honor, and let me try to explain why. first of all, this court made clear in casey, dealing with the exact same language, it took  you know, that's at issue here 
well, i will certainly attempt to do so. i  i think the flaw in the icj's reasoning is failure to recognize that in the united states all criminal defendants are  are given an attorney, and that that attorney is charged with providing constitutionally effective assistance of counsel, meaning being aware of all of the constitutional rights and all of the federal and state statutory, and presumably federal  federal treaty rights as well. there's no doubt that no virginia official informed mr. bustillo of his opportunity to contact the consulate, but it is also clear that his retained counsel knew of it and chose not to pursue it. now, that may or may not be ineffective assistance of counsel, but it does not justify setting aside the state's procedural bars on collateral review, which would apply for a miranda violation or a fourth amendment violation. i would also note, your honor, that the united states is unique in the world in having an extensive system of collateral review for criminal convictions. most of the rest of the world doesn't have a method of collateral attack. so if the rest of the world doesn't have to have a method of collateral attack, it seems rather disingenuous to suggest that the united states has to modify our rules of collateral attack in order to accommodate the treaty.
 the time.
well, but that decision in this  they had no reason to challenge it until the state decided to  to change it.
are you going to address the other questions? i think we added a question about whether the kansas supreme court's judgment was adequately supported by an independent state ground. and i'm not sure that this has been adequately addressed. do we have jurisdiction here? the  the kansas supreme court vacated the capital murder judgment and remanded it and said it would have done it anyway because of the state law evidentiary error concerning admission of third party guilt evidence. so does that independent ground mean we don't have jurisdiction here on this thing?
well, i  i think the case should never have been allowed to go forward except with the named plaintiffs. okay.
well, that's why i said at&t has taken two positions. here's the position that they took in their brief before the court of appeals. three decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively recognized software to be a physical and structural component of patented machines. the problem, justice stevens 
no, your honor, i think then that the question would be what would be the purpose in such a statute if all you had to do was literally call a number and the judge would say, okay. if the judge had no time  the nurse had no time to relay the facts, the judge had no time to ask any questions, the judge had no time to consider the evidence or look at the law, there is a real question about what potential purpose there could be of requiring even that small delay before a minor gets the immediate treatment she needs.
but if the state law provides that part of the recovery goes to the state, then at least as to the part that goes to the state you can say, well the state has recovered and you can't 
which can do what?
do you really believe that? i mean, in  in a large  you know, large  large operation, you  you're a minority. you apply for a job. you're qualified for it. you aren't hired, but somebody who's not a minority is hired. that alone, without any other information, is enough to enable somebody to find that it is more likely than not that  that race was the reason? my goodness. i  i don't think that's an accurate description.
 where no one is hurt. you catch it in the bud, for example, where no one is hurt. you don't want the possible class of plaintiffs to spread out into every competitor, into competitors' suppliers. it's a way of cutting off the potential class to people who are closer to any possible injury where, for example, there really wasn't any injury at all. so, i mean, that's the kind of argument being made for it, not that you find the word reliance somewhere in the statute.
 that's not a discharge of a pollutant 
no, justice kennedy. we agree 14 that (4) is applicable in a case like this. it's just 15 that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of 16 it is wrong. we offer two alternative interpretations of 17 how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this. before i get to them, i'd like to respond to a 19 question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was 20 standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty 21 of getting everything that needed to be done done in the 22 space of a year. it's critical to keep in mind that in the 24 typical case of this type, the factual basis for the state 25 claim is going to available at the time of the state 1 guilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be 2 years before the federal conviction becomes final. and 3 since the limitation provision under aedpa runs from the 4 latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is 5 going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a state 6 conviction and he'll have up until a year after his 7 federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.
and its particularly  particular reference to the targeted group that was moved out of the district.
that's your strong point.
 of any sort, of course. i know that. [laughter.]
because  because the language of the statute is what draws the key link difference to me, your honor. the statute says an arbitration provision is enforceable if it is in a contract evidencing interstate commerce. the in a contract makes the legality of the whole contract  for the contract comes into existence. you can't drive this car until you start it, and the way that the federal arbitration act works is it becomes enforceable once those terms are met. under their theory, there's no good reason why in prima paint this court spent all those pages talking about whether interstate commerce was met. why wasn't that for the arbitrator? the reason that that wasn't for the arbitrator was that was something that went to the threshold issue of whether section 2 had been met.
 the warrant in this case  -
our position is that  is that the federal law creates a floor, justice scalia, that congress established the rules 
but you're arguing now, as i understand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is that it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes.
they did, but erroneously, and i  we believe that you have a responsibility to do an independent examination of the record. for instance, there was a finding by the district court that these amounts were, quote, suspiciously large. now, if you look at the record and you look at the six individuals 
 but 
we believe that the integrity of the election process, justice scalia, is in fact served by helping ensure that individuals make voluntary contributions. we think that in fact it does help the integrity of the election process, yes, sir.
 of 
so on your view of it, his complaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed as not ripe because he didn't have the final element 
okay.
well, but 
but suppose you had in a title vii case the employer says, i'm not going to give you a nondiscriminatory reason. you  you've gone through the mcdonnell douglas. the plaintiff has shown those four things. the employer says, i'm not going to give you any reason. then what happens?
no. justice breyer, you don't understand.
why should that be an issue that a court should decide?
thank you, ms. brinkmann. mr. machat, you have three minutes remaining.
that is correct, justice scalia.
it seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal, which i think is a congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system.
aren't there several possible explanations for why congress would leave the "before or after" language out of the  out of the new provision? they might have wanted it just to be decided under the landgraf framework. isn't that one possibility? or they might have thought that "before or after" referred to the enactment of the ina, which would be 1952, and, therefore, irrelevant by the time this was passed.
 on things like prior convictions, other things unrelated to a specific transaction. and if he thinks that assisted suicide is contrary conduct that threatens the public interest, health and safety, i don't know why that wouldn't apply to dr. kevorkian, as well as somebody using controlled substances.
yes.
the decision that was violated was the rule of darden, donnelly, and romano, which is that 
no, not at summary judgment. what i'm saying is that at the pleading stage to allege that, which is an allegation of fact, satisfies pleading standards. just to allege it with testimony on the other side and no evidence to prove that allegation on summary judgment 
in other words, if  i mean, it's awfully surprising  i think that's why you're getting this resistance  that there's an issue in a case, does  is the  the state action preempted or not. they've never had an appeal. so they get it tried. the whole case is tried out, and then the  some state court says, in our opinion it is preempted. but they can't decide that. they can't decide it because there was a federal judge who said the opposite in the same case before the case was final.
well, your honor, i think that would be a most peculiar rule. entering judgment in a case is one of the most fundamental and important things that a court does.
was that how it worked under the plan that was forced on the school district? i thought it was roughly the same plan?
it just had to show that they weren't. so it doesn't matter whether they were using his theory or too little cement. it doesn't matter.
do we know that as a fact?
only if the  if in uniformity of interpretation of the contract?
well, didn't the district court say one of its criteria was preserving incumbency?
because there was no discharge of a pollutant. there were pollutants in  - on both sides. that  i think that was conceded in the case. the reason that the case came out the way it did was that we held there was no discharge of a pollutant.
and the government  and the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet title route she would have lost the advantageous  she would have had to make. she could never complete a quiet title suit within the time that she needed to execute this sale.
but now your  your part about the guilt, the sixth circuit agreed with you because it vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction. and what is your argument that the conviction is infirm?
the $90 is for plating. it said only  only michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90. everybody else  everybody  and everybody also pays the $10.
what about an assumption, for example, that when we read the code, we read it with a view towards thinking congress did not want to produce such unfair results?
 when you first give him the miranda warnings, or tell me how you think it should work?
no. they thought  the  the board  the federal circuit at least, which echoed the board of contract appeals, thought 
well, i think that the 
then why did you leave the words orally out? why is it not a statement, allegation of fact?
but they said "a reasonable period of time for waiting" is non-compensable. and that, at least as a general rule, is not 
no, your honor. i respectfully disagree. this is  i believe this is a question of federal constitutional law that needs to be applied everywhere. this is a rule followed in 12  all 12 federal district  circuits and in 48 of the 50 states.
because.
why isn't the distinction the right to rely?
what about the willful and wanton  suppose the facts were just as they say, long-standing practice, not responding, doing nothing, doing nothing here despite evidence of serious danger, and being told you shouldn't do anything, don't pay any attention he'll come home, would that show willful and wanton?
 and not a purely factual 
because, justice breyer, i think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the isda because the isda specifically reserves to the secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.
general abbott, we'll hear for you, please.
mr. bopp, would you clarify a procedural point? as i understand it, on the expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has gone back to the district court for further proceedings.
i think that in this case it just  i don't think the court really has to get to the outer reaches of this because in many of these cases, it's overwhelming 
well, your honor, i would disagree with that, that in fact 
may i ask this question? because i hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you attach to the missouri pacific case. and the way you describe it as saying that the  the state court cannot be held to have decided against a federal right  well, anyway, the  the point is there are two things that are decided by the federal court when it remands a case. one, there was no preemption, and two, therefore, there shall be a removal. now, as i understood the principle underlying that case, the  the correctness of the remand could not be reviewed. that's litigated. but could not the correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely there was no preemption, be removed by us on certiorari?
do the police have any duty at all, in your view?
and having gleaned that perception, i'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. and paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, justice scalia, i think consistent with first amendment issues. and i think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day  modern age 
well, what would you do with strategic site selection in order to create racial diversity?
i think probably the garlotte case, your honor, in which the court allowed a habeas challenge where the only result was going to be to advance the date of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.
justice breyer, i don't think that it depends on how many pages that the agency devoted to the 
all right.
all right. so you think  you and the government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the government.
very well, mr. rosenkranz. mr. joseffer.
would  would it  if  suppose in the instance i put they  the  the state has  has an objection, but the settlement is made, nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar. do you still think you have the right to receive 100 percent of your payment from the proceeds in the case that i put?
but the question is not what 924(c)(2) means, standing alone or in the abstract; it's what it means, as incorporated into 1101(a)(43). and 
but if it isn't, i would like to know what it is.
no. the  that is correct. the permit permits the discharge into a navigable water of the united states. that is the object of the permit. again, the rules that the respondent has adopted since 1975 have specifically excluded the nundane ditch, as well as the drain next to that ditch, as being defined as waters of the united states. so therefore, even if they could show a connection, which is a question that has been raised, would in fact the wetland be regulated, by the  by the respondents' own definitions and by the statutory definition which excludes a ditch and a drain under section 1262(12) and (14), neither the ditch or the sutherland-oemig drain by definition is a water of the united states. it is a point source and therefore not a water. so even if they could 
you may be right. in this case did any  either the court of appeals or the district court terminate the stay?
i'm not sure that that's the way the black court interpreted it. the black court talked about a requirement that the upper-term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists.
no, your honor. i believe there is no abuse of the discretion here because if a stay had not 
over what period of time?
well 
yes.
but you left out one word that i think is important there. to test it to see if i'm right about this is i thought 2679(b) was focusing in large part upon state tort suits. is that right?
what would prevent the valid execution of a warrant that had no time limits whatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must be supported by probable cause. and if agents executed a warrant at a time at which there was no probable cause, for example, because they executed it before the delivery had taken place or they executed it after a time at which probable cause had become stale, the search would be unreasonable and the fruits of the search would probably have to be suppressed.
you mean that the  are you saying then in the context of this case that the federal law would have to create a quiet title action, which is traditionally state law?
and what is the theory behind that? is, the theory is it that the white students there or the asian students or the latino students would not benefit from having african-american classmates? it is enough if they have either asian classmates or latino classmates or white classmates? how do you  how do square that with your, your objective of providing benefits that flow from racial balance?
well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence. we know that he's still going to be held and he's going to be held in custody. it's a question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.
that's correct.
all right. then why, if that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said he attempted to and committed an overt act in  that is a substantial step. and then you're saying in addition, they have to list the particular facts.
mr. long 
did  did the stay remain in effect in the district court, in your view?
and that if he returned, he could be prosecuted for the prior reentry. and i suppose, in theory  i don't know what the extradition treaty is  in theory, he might be subject to extradition for it.
i would agree with that. indeed, the question 
right. but that could have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual purpose. one to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or the nondispositive character of the state court's finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate assistance of counsel. and the question here is that, the immediate question is what exactly did the state court find with respect to  oh, sorry  what exactly did the ninth circuit find with respect to the state court finding? and there's no question that the ninth circuit assumed that the state court finding was not necessarily dispositive, but i don't know that it's clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you could help me if i'm wrong.
yes.
that's in the notice. it's not in  it's not in the decision.
i mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, i think. (laughter.)
your honor, including not only that testimony, but the testimony of the same expert who made the statements which the court just cited, who said that she was unable  that she was excluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of blood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony that the transfer stains which she observed, the type of stains which she observed could, in fact, have been  that she had no opinion as to the cause of those, only that it was the result of one object wiping against another object. also, in light of the testimony in regarding 
appeals as of right?
 up the river.
yes, your honor. official that's what happened. but, and in that 
that  that was a fact in nelson, but my question to you is if  if we were to agree with you and say that that, in fact, is a  is an element of a 1983 action here, what would be the source of  of the  the conclusion that  that he has to propose a less painful alternative?
your honor, this would be a very different case if the state had  if the legislature had passed a tax that said, "this is a tax on receipt," and we were trying to argue that these  that somehow these exemptions made it not a tax on receipt. but the legislature has said it is a tax on the "use, sale, or delivery." and if i could point to two provisions that i think make this crystal clear, that it is not a tax on receipt, but on the subsequent use, sale, or delivery. the first is 3417, which provides 
that's correct, your honor.
it seems  it seems intuitive also that the prosecution's witnesses will be difficult to locate and so forth. has  has there been anything written about that, about prejudice to the prosecution from  from delay, or is it just something we 
mr. nolas, you haven't 16 mentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest 17 that there be a  a follow-up inquiry into the  the 18 abuse of alcohol by the defendant?
then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?
at what point does it get characterized as a class action, before this discovery or after?
would the  at the time that 4515  is that the 
 "on the merits." it said nothing at all. it just disposed of it. so, the question presented is quite different.
so now what you're saying is, in a commerce clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. that's a task, and i'm trying to make it as complicated as i can in my question. [laughter.]
well, i  we agree entirely with the first part of what  what your honor has said. we  we agree completely that the complete diversity requirement, which has been articulated so many times, means that when you bring in a  a nondiverse party, it destroys jurisdiction. there is not a single case from this court or that i know of any other court that states that the jurisdiction over the original action is destroyed. one of the things that was said here very  somewhat cleverly this morning is that in zahn the  the case was not allowed to go forward because of the presence of these other parties. that isn't what they said. three different times in zahn the court said these parties must be dismissed. there is no jurisdiction over these parties whose claims are small. they are out. no one ever said, oh, my goodness, we're going to lose jurisdiction over the case. every time this issue arises in the context of  of complete diversity, the court says, oh, my goodness, we don't have jurisdiction. we can't hear any part of this.
did the arbitrator 
i was going to say, if  on the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even know that the petition has been filed, because the  you don't  the court hasn't called for a response, the whole rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as i understand it, because you point out that the rationale for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you on notice as to the case that you have to meet. and you shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever preliminary steps you've taken. but in the scenario that you're talking about, you have not been put on notice, because you don't even know there is a petition there yet. you have not been led to prepare a case which has now changed. so it seems to me that your rationale does not apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice, and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.
well, what their  their argument is essentially that this policy was basically a decision by default, not a decision that was reasoned by prison administrators. they  they essentially said virtually everything has been taken away from these prisoners.
neither of us have any objection, and it's been quoted extensively 
well, i have no idea about that. i'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the question i think that i would have is why doesn't the statute propose the route for a state in your  in your position that i just said. if they have a good faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this good faith settlement is attributable to the medical expense and you are out $40,000  $50,000, you can sue the other party. and if you're in the case, you just proceed with the suit.
the hoops that congress went to, and which i have articulated, in the congressional findings, are that the particular harm that congress was addressing in slusa  this was a narrow  you know, this was a narrowly framed preemption as to federal-law claims, because a  the pslra only governed federal-law claims. and if you could not bring a holder claim under federal law, because of blue chip stamps, you were forced into state court. okay? so, when congress is debating the evasion of the pslra, it is only talking about federal-law claims. and there's nothing in the legislative history that they've cited, or that we have found, to suggest that congress gave any thought to preempting a class of holder claims. now, certainly 
we agree that the plaintiff, it's clear that under - in the ninth circuit - the ninth circuit pointed out that, justice ginsburg quoted before, made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion.
mr. waxman, do i 
it's $200. the same question or $201.
in  in 
well, justice kennedy, it seems to me that under the court's strict scrutiny analysis, which in my judgment should have applied here, and under the particularized circumstance test announced in the lee case in the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single prisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not to give rise to a systematic change in  in a policy which is rooted in racial stereotype. with regard to those prisoners involved in that particular circumstance, of course, some period of  of segregation would be appropriate as a means of controlling and ensuring that there's not going to be some kind of wholesale racial violence. that 
there's nothing fallacious about the argument if one accepts that excluding the truth in  in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff in that circumstance 
 the fact that other states aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because other states 
 congress spoke about section  schedule 1 drugs, and that's what's lacking here. congress says schedule 1 drugs, those are: no, never; schedule 2: okay on a doctor's prescription.
well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?
as late as 1978, the justice department didn't think that way, did it?
the waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver. to show how breathtaking the state's argument 
so under this system if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, that would not contravene blakely. but if you're convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does violate blakely.
me too.
so you're saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute, that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical.
so you don't believe that, then. you think that indeed the reason the government was given the money has to be connected with, with his allegations? right?
well, in this case, let me just me more question on it. in this case, suppose there had been a witness who said at about the time when this murder took place, i saw somebody who was between, i would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average height, average build, running away. and let's say that your client fits that description. now would that be enough to take this case out of the rule that you're arguing for?
great question and the answer is no, they can't. and the reason is 
i  i 
the contracts between the individual and the carrier are dictated by opm in some sense because opm negotiates the terms that bind the individual. so, the contract that you and i enter into when we sign on for health insurance is a part of the  of the program, if you will, that's negotiated by opm with the carrier.
what do you make of the argument that unless the cause of the arrest is, number one, stated and, number two, a  a cause that a defendant can rely on, that in any case like this in which the stated grounds of the arrest turn out to be  we will assume, turn out to be inadequate, the police will always, particularly in traffic cases, be able to come up with something later on to justify the arrest? what  what do you make of that argument?
your honor, it  it could, but i 
how could the court  how could a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage? determining whether there's strong evidence of one type or another.
in short, your honor 
i understand what 
you were saying they have no harm? i think they're pointing to that harm.
mr. dreeben, could  could i ask you if the government would  would defend a  an anticipatory warrant in these circumstances? the postal inspectors know that the unlawful video has been put in the mail and they know that it  it is going to one of 17 individuals. they're not sure which one of the 17. so they go and get a warrant that says, you know  and  and it will be obvious in my hypothesis that the delivery of the video has occurred. so can they get a warrant that says you can go in  it lists all of these 17 people. and it says you can go into their premises as soon as you see delivery of the video. would  would you support that kind of an anticipatory warrant?
well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, i think. but 
well, suppose you have a state and the state has a statute, and the statute says any motion for acquittal may be granted by the  the trial court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by the district court at any time before  or by the trial court at any time before the submission of the case to the jury. then there's no repose element because the  the defendant is on notice that this may not be final. what would be the  your position in that case if a statute like that were on the books? and if you say that that's different, then i'll say, well, suppose the supreme court of massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial matter.
well, we know that the tax court has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice it followed here because it said so. and it would be quite extraordinary, we submit, for this court to reverse the tax court, which is surely entitled to considerable deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all, the tax court has exclusive statutory authority to promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to this issue about whether the special trial judge can change his report, since that was not even one of the questions presented. if i may turn to  back to the statutory question. section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of the tax court. the special trial judge report is not the report of the tax court. indeed, even a tax court judge's opinion and report does not become the report of the tax court.
that's right, but 
quite a bit different than penry.
because?
at a minimum, the alternative has to be one that is permissible under currently governing law.
well, it didn't provide a notice of what the essential facts was. those are overlapping concepts, certainly, but we did not know what the facts 
justice souter, let me offer this in two ways. one, it's not realistic. in  in other words, when  when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't  i mean, these parents and  and the  and especially in birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. we have a director of athletics for the whole school system. and so that  that's not realistic, i mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.
well, it can't. under the contract 
so if he didn't and therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect, then what? are you going to say we have to track down  i mean what it's reminding me of is like trying to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.
your honor, i think there are two relevant things about that statement. first is the significance of his referencing the mccarthy case and demonstrating affirmatively that congress was, indeed, aware of that decision when it revised the statute. but, moreover, it was another iteration of the purposes that congress sought to achieve through enactment of the statute. so, speaking to the third point, which was purposes of the statute, our position is that those purposes are directly served by a rule in which inmates are required to comply with administrative grievance proceedings. by contrast, those rules are subverted by a rule in which an inmate is permitted to file an untimely appeal, which is rejected on procedural grounds, and which, therefore, receives the benefit of no prior administrative review.
you don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?
no, your honor. certainly many patents are valueless, which is one of the reasons why 
if they can prove that that's the reason why they didn't jump in and compete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason for what they did.
i understand that, and i think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the psd regulations. but what i official am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed. they don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor. and then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.
i do not. at some 
yes.
well, on direct review, chapman clearly says it's a federal question what the standard of review may be. and on direct review, it's undoubted that a harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard is required by chapman. this case doesn't present the issue on whether on state  post-conviction, a state can have the latitude of requiring greater harm, because on the cca's own analysis, the standard of harm that's applied on state habeas is identical to the standard of harm that's applied on direct review, the standard of almanza, which posits chapman error, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for preserved error, and egregious harm for unpreserved error.
i  my basic answer as to why that would be the policy, your honor, are, again, the textual reasons and the large objective reasons. let me go back to the  finishing up the textual reasons, if that is satisfactory. the statute previously had said  had included the word "improvidently." back when only costs could be awarded, and not fees, the statute had used the word "improvidently." now, many courts  - and i don't vouch for this interpretation, but i note that it was prevalent  many courts then said costs may be awarded, or should be awarded, only when the removal was improvident, in the sense of being worse than merely incorrect. and the congress deleted that word, "improvident"  "improvidently." now, this, i submit, is a good indication that the congress did not mean for there to be a standard of "worse than incorrectness." had congress meant for that to be the standard, then congress would not have deleted the word that had gotten many courts there, or congress would have put in some other textual reason.
no, your honor, because in prison the animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and that inmate may be subjected 
but that  that doesn't operate internationally.
see? one's negative and one's positive. and everything else is the same. then how do you 
suppose i disagreed with you about that, then would you lose the case?
well, we don't know before the criminal case starts whether mr. wallace will receive a full and fair hearing on his fourth amendment claim. and until we know that we don't say stone versus powell would bar a fourth amendment claim. we don't know that the state will give mr. wallace an attorney who can stay awake, who can file a motion, who knows that there is a fourth amendment, and mr. wallace might end up not getting a full and fair hearing and might have a valid claim cognizable with federal habeas corpus that 
yes.
and even if it takes a year or so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.
all right. but it wouldn't fit within your  i mean, i just wonder what happens when you try to get away from numbers. maybe there are a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during an embezzlement and start hitting each other. i can't get away from the numbers.
north dakota indicates otherwise, i believe, your honor. in north dakota, this court said that, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of its regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be appropriate and necessary for states to impose unique rules on out-of-state vendors. in north dakota, the court did not say 
the simple question is the procedural objection, as the four judges suggested, could have precluded consideration of the federal claim at all.
what about the experts? you said this was obvious and this should have, not have gotten very far. but there were two experts, were there not, who made declarations, that had all kinds of credentials, and they called it elegant, novel and nonobvious.
when someone is fleeing and creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to breaking off the chase? what, what is the test.
absolutely.
may i ask? i don't think the charges are in the record. at least i missed them. they were charged with  what are the charges and how  what were the penalty for what the defendants were exposed to? there's been no trial. they  they suppressed the evidence. i suppose the proceedings were dismissed, were they?
it still would be true. and  but the fact is, in this case you have a  off-reservation tax, on the  all distributors 
i'd like to know the text you rely on.
well, but i mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that  that part of the recovery was  was for the  for the medical expenses. and has that been shown?
no, your honor. what's the last expression is the foundations display which clearly a reasonable observer would see. and if there is any doubt regarding 
but, look, you're talking about procedural means. i want to know what your immediate response to their claim of privilege is. are you going to say we weren't spies?
that's absolutely correct. and if, in this case, that judgment had been made by ceballos's employer, that he had exercised poor judgment, that he was rash or reckless in his conclusions, then the employer would have had a valid basis for taking an adverse employment action against him. but that is not what happened in this case.
 this colloquy to raise another question, if i may? would you concede that there are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to what you might call a kangaroo court that congress would not have intended to include within the term court?
okay. your honor, this is a point of, perhaps, semantics. but the  by the time you get to penalty phase, there's nothing to excuse the crime, in the sense of self-defense or "not guilty by reason of insanity." the only thing 
is that usually will be because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?
 is, you'd rather not have policemen search you, but your alternative is going to be in jail.
general clement, you have three minutes remaining.
at the end of the day. and there was a separate sentencing hearing?
that  that would include in the  that would include the 2 percent. but there are provisions, i should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. so you'd have to take into account 
 were it an ordinary contract.
and we think it's critical that our position is that this statute only operates in the area of labeling, and it preempts only those state labeling requirements 
and is he a person who has a right to liberty, entitled to some protection, very, very, very minimal, but there is some protection to that  that individual.
no, justice scalia, in a footnote in flast, the court specifically says, "having now decided that there's establishment clause standing, we can also reach the free-exercise question without discussing whether there would be" 
it seems to me those words  i forget what the  "commit threats of physical violence." so, take those words. the statute will have the same meaning.
i think that the judge in the obligation of imposing an individual sentence must consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be free to shape and tailor that advice as the circumstances of that case require.
yes 
after.
 not need a conviction under section 924 if you're bringing a prosecution under section 924(c).
normally, yes, sir.
let me  let me 
that?
yes, absolutely. you  it  you can  you should decide the question presented. and if you decide the question presented in our favor  that is, that congress has  does not have the power to abrogate sovereign immunity  you would presumably remand to the sixth circuit for further proceedings, consistent with your opinion. at that time, katz could attempt to present these other defenses. we would, of course, argue that some of those defenses had not been properly preserved. but it has not been briefed below.
well, he certainly 
may i ask you this question?
that  that may well be.
well, suppose  suppose somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to  by the government to have breached the agreement by writing and publishing a tell-all book about it.
i suppose the way the statute works, you have to opt in for the election expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out for other non-germane.
 minnesota has said that 
no, we would 
was there a conference report in 
they are not entitled to ifp status?
why is it two or three percent?
they were?
well, it's not a simple case.
that's right, your honor. but the question is, what exactly is the state purporting to tax? this is a situation in which the state is not being unambiguous  is being unambiguous about what it's taxing.
so in an ordinary city street in miami walking along the street, there are a lot of houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted burglary, not burglary, in florida?
thank you, mr. donahue. mr. hungar.
and the answer 
well, it has to be that way? i could write a contract differently.
skidmore was before a rather significant case called chevron.
well, i mean, i don't really think there's any serious dispute about which it is. i mean, this is something that is 
in other words, the disk plus the  plus the coded instructions.
the  the fact 
 i thought we had to decide whether an unnamed private party should be considered for jurisdictional purposes.
well, i think it's a fair conclusion that they meant the two to mean the same thing, whether it was before griggs or after griggs. they copied the language. it seems to me they wanted the two to mean the same.
well, that is correct, justice souter.
well, it's certainly  it's certainly an alternative ground. it's not  it doesn't affect, i think, our verdict. and so i think what  i mean, i suppose the court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it  that it should reverse that part of the ruling.
yes. yes, i understand. but all that has to happen, of course, is that the complaint be put on file in the federal court. it's notice pleading. it can be a very, very long complaint.
okay, so 
yes. there is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent. it has  it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the  at the indigent only. so i do  i do not agree that this 
would you agree that there's a requirement that the exhaustion period be reasonable?
yes. i think it's true in the vast majority of cases, the government does have proof of an overt act. and, of course, overt acts help establish the  establish the agreement and  and to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement. if the court has no further questions 
thank you, mr. goldstein. mr. gornstein.
thank you, general kline. the case is submitted.
no, your honor, we don't because the  the economic literature 
no, i don't believe that it can be if  because the court is not, the correct function of the court under a rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to be decided by whether it believes or is persuaded by the allegations in the complaint.
there are two separate things that are going on. one is what the magistrate must do at the time that he issues the warrant. the magistrate must find that there is probable cause to believe that offense  an offense has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, and that the items that the warrant is going to request to be seized will be present at the location at the time of execution. and the magistrate in this case was easily able to make those determinations based on the warrant affidavit that was submitted to him. but there is an additional requirement of reasonableness, that officers may not execute a warrant, even if it was validly issued, if they become aware of facts that would tell a reasonable officer 
because? what's  what's the principle i'm going to use?
but that's a decision for the state to make. i mean, the  what 
i don't believe so.
yes.
they would, and i think that's not a fair assumption and it's certainly not the way to decide whether harmless error analysis should apply. i mean, blakely has been on the books for a couple of years. neder has been out there for 7 years, and we haven't seen people deliberately trying to get around people's sixth amendment rights.
 exhaust their internal remedies.
dr. 
now why, in making that inquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be inventive and come up with a definition when congress has given a definition that can be used by default? if congress thinks it should be other than the general definition they have provided, congress can also do that. but in the meantime, why should the courts go creating definitions instead of using the one that's right there in the statute book?
so your complaint about the paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that argument.
it depends totally on how they characterize?
why wouldn't it be an abuse of discretion in this case? because there seems to be an ample record here that the legislature, or a majority of the legislature made a conscious choice that they would rather have no statute than a statute with a health exception in it. they deliberately said the only statute we want is one without a health exception. therefore, even if you touch all the bases that justice breyer has laid out, don't you end up with a position that if we were to craft such a limitation, we would be flying quite precisely in the face of the expressed legislative intent.
well, i don't think so if you look at the evidence. the evidence that we presented included a forest economist who presented three different scenarios where he identified how much weyerhaeuser had artificially increased log prices above where they would have been but for their anticompetitive behavior. we in no way went to the jury in closing, saying award what you think is fair. we relied completely on that evidence, and in fact the jury, which included a ph.d. in physics in a high-tech industry, an accountant, the head of a chain store, and a banker and a retired farmer, they looked at the evidence and they actually to the dollar picked one of those market -based scenarios for how much was the market elevated.
but isn't there this  isn't there this anomaly in the position that you're advocating? it would seem to me that categories of employee speech that are most likely to be disruptive would be public speech that's outside of the employee's duties, or internal speech that is outside of the employee's duties. how much of a  of a problem is it that employees are bringing first amendment claims based on largely internal speech that falls within their own job duties?
in this case they didn't  they didn't say because longstanding cca precedent made clear that 
we don't really know who prepared that colloquy anyway, do we?
is the reason  is there a further reason that they've got to  to plead loss causation? and that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as  as making  as  as saying that if you were going to recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect have  have got to prove your loss in a certain way. and you're saying if you're going to  if you're going to sue on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all the elements of fraud on the market. and if you allege all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to allege exactly what you've just been saying is required. so it's not so the  i  i guess what i'm  i'm getting at is maybe what  maybe the nub of the answer is not necessarily that there's  that there's fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an element.
no, your honor. i would disagree.
the fact that your equitable claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't  doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable claim. i mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he declares a trust. equity will enforce that trust, but the trust is based on a contractual commitment. right?
that seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable.
 what we would have 
see, that's exactly what's concerning me, and i don't quite see my way to an answer. suppose we do send it back because we think just what you said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this. they'll have to go into it. should we suggest, "look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy." every government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences. so, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, "no, actually, there are quite a few differences." i don't have much of a feeling for which way to go on that.
 omit the reference to the candidate.
you have the federal officer situation and you have the fsia, foreign sovereign immunities act situation, your honor.
well, the treaty doesn't in  in its text doesn't say, thou shalt suppress, but is  it is a source of authority because the treaty says thou shalt give full effect to the law.
may i ask you about 
am i right that the statute as written says you don't have any judicial review for these kinds of actions? you go through the grievance procedure, win or lose. that's it. there is no judicial review.
and then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera. and there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in france and one in the netherlands, all of which i think was relevant to a treaty. all right? now, the government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, i guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting dmt. now, what's the response to that?
yes, your honor. and  and if  perhaps my distinction is  is too homely, but i would say that's about what comes into his mind, into the brain, his senses. did he see this taillight? did he see the sticker? not what comes out of his mouth as a result of the functioning of that brain, his legal brain. the legal work is for the courts looking at an arrest that's been challenged through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer. it does not depend, else fourth amendment seizures would be not reasonable, but would vary depending upon the skills of an individual officer from roadside to roadside. and that is utterly inconsistent with this court's precedent and would, in fact, gut the objective reasonableness test. the ninth circuit's rule would lead to dramatically uneven law enforcement. it would, indeed, lead to either stacking or silence, and there's plenty of good reason why an officer or a federal agent, who are not required to say anything at arrest, might want to inform a defendant of a basis for his arrest and might want to uphold other bases for an arrest, to protect a witness, for example. to drive police officers to the extremes is not in the public interest.
how many times have we dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made that it was watershed and therefore should be retroactive? this is not the first time.
the tributary  you say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary. that's a  a culvert, a ditch. right?
well, this did go back in front of the two  two of the three original sentencers and they declined to allow him to vacate his sentence. the intermediate appellate court then independently reweighed and expressly said, whether he's the shooter or not, he's eligible for the death sentence. so there have been a number of ohio judges that have 
well, looking back, that is probably correct. but looking at the order, and the way it came out, and the fact that you know, the  the rule allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at the end date of the order, make sure the notice of appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that the party who is adversely affected by it may object on that basis, saying judge, you have no authority to do this, what are you doing in connection with 
well, i  i guess in that respect, justice o'connor, i disagree because the third circuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow version of rooker-feldman. and, in fact, using this case as the vehicle to decide this, the  the definition of rooker-feldman in this instance amounts to no more than barring jurisdiction in a second federal suit over the identical claims. this is not a case where you have to worry about claims that might have been brought, the sort of things that footnote 16 in feldman dealt with.
i understand this dialogue. and what we have  (laughter.) i too have been with the dissenters in these cases, and what i'm trying to argue for here is a set of principles that appellate courts can apply and that district courts can look to when sentencing, that will come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving congress's aims in the sentencing reform act without crossing over the bright line rule that this court has announced 
what does it mean?
correct.
but 
right. but the second  but the question is not  the question is whether or not that issue is fairly subsumed within the question that was actually presented, and that 
and how many has it  in the district courts, how many have been rejected when it's something like television or recreation?
well, again, justice souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. but i can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.
exemption. the statutory exemption. i thought that was what we were looking at.
now, is it your position that a state can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy claims?
so then, the commerce clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate? we could decide it may be appropriate to run waste facilities but not to run milk pasteurization. i don't know how we would do that.
so the  we don't know yet.
well, but  no. but i'm  i'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which the  the statement was taken. i'm talking about the capacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the truth of that statement once it is placed before the court. and i understood your argument to justice breyer to assume that that testing function was not within the contemplation of the framers.
i  i don't know enough about  about that machine to  to accurately comment on  on that. i know that the challenges that were brought in brown wasn't necessarily regarding the machine itself, but it was the qualifications of  of the people monitoring the machine and whether they had the authority and ability to intervene in the execution itself. and i believe that that was the challenge that was ruled upon by the court in mr. brown's case before he was executed.
i think it's  i think it is very similar to the letter and  and could well be inadmissible, but i don't know that it's  if the court adheres to the test that it set forth in crawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that were prohibited at common law, certainly that would not have been one of them.
they did not do that, and what they did was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence, including expert affidavits.
i wouldn't either.
basically, i mean you've heard the question and so forth. it seems to me that my questions and certainly others were based on certain empirical premises that might be true, might not be true. so why isn't this a question for the rules committee? why not go to the rules committee if this really is a burden and so forth, rather than doing something unusual, which is to make exhaustion something other than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole complaint, which appear to be rules that reached draconian results in a few cases anyway.
well, justice kennedy, it is perfectly true that there are places in the statute where medical or scientific decisions are expressly given to the secretary of health and human services and not the attorney general, but it is equally true that there are places in the controlled substances act where medical determinations or public-health determinations are given expressly to the attorney general and not the secretary of health and human services. and one of the places, of course, that's true is sections 823 and 824 of title 1  title 21  which, of course, are the provisions about the registration and revocation of registrants. and congress 
that  that is part of the appeal. there are obviously some people simply because of family tradition or it may help them with their job or because the libertarians are controversial, some people may want to keep it quiet and don't formally affiliate other than they might wish to vote. but our appeal and request was not simply those people but to many people, the vast majority of oklahomans who never vote 
and  and we  we cited some other examples as  as examples that, on the face of it and on the face of the record, would  would lawfully fall within the  the general rule that we said congress could prescribe.
do we have any case in which what was being  what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?
well, it's not true. you certainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now. i thought that there has to be a finding of some aggravating factor, not simply, i think deterrence is more than what the statute says, or deterrence requires more than what the statute says. is that really your position, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more than the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say i ignore the middle range?
it does, justice ginsburg. as the government explained in its brief in the robinson case, post-employment references are reasonably viewed as a term, condition, or privilege of employment because it's routine for employees to request them and routine for employers to provide them. now, if i could address the 
 a full trial.
all this record shows, your honor, is that the mandate did not issue. so the reason for that is  is not clear.
suppose i were to conclude that under casey, this fraction test applies to this case. suppose i were to say that salerno should not be applicable in this case. how should i rule in this case?
 the state side, so the state has introduced evidence from which a trier could conclude he intended to kill a police officer. but he wants to introduce, on the other side, "i didn't have that intent. in fact, i had delusions. i thought i killed an alien." but he's not allowed to introduce that evidence 
but the government 
but aren't  aren't those claims moot or academic now? because, as i understand it, he has had another parole hearing. so he's  with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. so he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or  or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. i thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.
i thought the court didn't say they were ignoring it. i thought they said it was curable.
mr. comey.
if we should think that the respondents are not liable for the type of contributory infringement dealt with in sony, could this court reach the question of active inducement on this record?
significantly, detective johns' conduct and his words, when  when office reese made the improper statement, detective johns immediately and firmly 
i thought the only fact that had to be found was that, given the classification sentencing scheme washington had, there would be, in effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless there were consecutive sentencing. that's not a fact that falls within any of those categories of crime, character, or circumstances.
 you have a facility that produces adverse environmental effects in one state, but produces power for a number of adjoining states. why does it make sense for the state in which the facility is located to do the balancing of the environmental and the power considerations in that situation?
justice breyer, i think that's the dilemma that the federal circuit has been facing and is in answer to the criticism of justice scalia and that is the federal circuit isn't trying to articulate every single possible thing that can show you that it is obvious. what it's trying to do is focus you on the right question. it's trying to say, here's the process of invention: we have to figure out there's a problem. we have to figure out what prior art you're going to use. you have to figure out how you're going to combine it, and then you actually combine it. the act of invention, the thing that is the discovery that we want to encourage, is there in the middle. it's picking out the prior art and deciding how to put it together.
justice souter, i don't think they're silly cases. i think that it is an important rule that the police show up and they are able to rely  if they only hear from one person, they're able to rely on that person. i don't  the  - i'm not claiming that our rule has great administrative advantages over the other side's. what i'm saying is that it is not necessary to sacrifice the individual's privacy who lives in the house  as you say, has an expectation of privacy. and so, let me return 
we don't have any record of that, but i  i can tell you that if members of opposing gangs were to request a cell together, first of all, they would both have to agree, which would be highly unlikely, and there  it would probably be viewed with a bit of suspicion as to what was going on. but maybe if  if they had disavowed their gang membership and  and these particular people could get along, it would certainly be considered. the  the object, once they get to the permanent housing, is cellmate compatibility. so there are a lot of things that are looked at.
because i haven't 
instruction number 5 does instruct the juror, justice souter, that if the state meets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the defendant to death.
 we have a passage 
it is an important question, and i would answer it this way. i would say that that hypothetical presents a much closer question. if the contract merely had a subrogation provision that said we are subrogated and the plan went in and tried to enforce that provision by employing equitable principles, seeking equitable remedies, that would be a closer question. that might be permissible under 502(a)(3). that's not what occurred here. i think it probably wouldn't be permissible because, although it would seek an equitable remedy, it wouldn't be an equitable remedy to 
yes, but it couldn't  if you are right, then the ninth circuit never should have touched this case. so what happens to the three parties, two u.s. parties, one british columbia, who are entitled to suit immunity?
but if you're on a round trip ticket from liverpool to miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket.
so what did they hold in the tenth circuit in respect to that?
your honor, we're not asking for the court to instruct the police department they have to drop everything 
yes. that there's any correlation whatsoever between how much these people  these prisoners read and when they get into the next level of the prison.
well, i'm asking a simpler question. let's assume that somehow we fudge it. if  if there is a clear cut case in which the eeoc takes a position different from the one the government is now espousing, and a court of appeals upholds it, and cert is sought here, will the solicitor general say please remand, or simply confess judgment?
the only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. and to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market  and we don't know whether they are or not 
but it really 
these are teachers who have not joined the washington education

well, i think, mr. chief justice, in the link case, the court rejected that argument in construing section 41(b), where the court said, quote, "neither the permissive language of the rule, which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant, nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the purpose of the rule to be abrogate the power of courts acting on their own initiative to clear their calendars of cases that have remained dormant because of the inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief." likewise in chambers, i think the same principle applied. the court said, we don't need to wait and deal with these subsequently occurring procedures to remedy official the problem. we should do it now. and that is the  that is the clear import of this court's unanimous decision in pepper versus litton. there was a remedy of equitable subordination for the fraudulent claim that could have been invoked far later in the proceeding. and this court unanimously said no, you don't have to wait for that proceeding later. where it's clear that there has been fraud, the creditor's scheme has been fraudulent, a fraudulent claim, the court can act at the time of allowance of the claim and simply deny the claim. the reason for it, i think, is the reason articulated in chambers. the integrity of the court itself is implicated if it has to sit back idly by and watch the abusive process unfold.
if the district court considers all those facts and considers what may have been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.
what  what was the basis then, or was there a basis, for judge easterbrook's comment, it's now or never?
they have first the outer limit of the 10 days in the warrant itself. and in fact, this warrant was executed within 2 days of its issuance. is that not 
 what would be the difference?
that would be a violation?
it would, your honor.
well, if they contracted with a credit bureau, for example, or a skip tracer, it is quite easy to find people that have moved across the country, much easier today than it was, you know, years ago because technology has really expanded the amount of information that is readily ascertainable.
justice breyer, if the instruction had been given the way you have just stated it we would have 
not  not as to the death  not as to  not as to the death sentence, no.
the  the problem is we wouldn't have been able to  to frame a clear jury instruction that would have indicated whether or not the loss that the jury should look at would be related to the disclosure about albuterol spiros, which would have occurred in the november time frame, or whether we would have had to step back to the february time frame and  and the loss that was incurred then. and the issue would have not only related to the  the damages instructions but would have related to the misrepresentation instruction. and the  the problem that  that we continue to have with the  the case after the ninth circuit's opinion is where do you look for the misrepresentation and where do you look for the damage and how do you know that there is a loss under the statute. you're looking at a  at a 
do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
the government, in their brief, asserts that the  that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they  which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the 
but i would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with leas. they have a per-pupil number because they've got a bunch of pupils. you take individual students, and you know for example in that school district you don't spend the same amount of money on the kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. and yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. it's an artificial association. it makes sense to speak of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the leas because they have so many pupils, they get so much money, you can do the calculation. it doesn't make sense to say, you know, john smith the kindergartner has a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. he may have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you creating this artificial association and then using, using that methodology?
kind of an eclectic museum. one message that you get is that the state is honoring the donor of the various 
may i ask this question? supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and there were minutes of the board of directors says that in order to do this we've got to drive company x out of business and so you, we want you to compete in every transaction with company x that you can and buy the logs at a higher price. would that be an anticompetitive act even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?
i would think that would apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?
 was, you look to the  to the activity which is governed by the new law. in the case of the  of the expert testimony, the activity governed is the trial, so that law applies prospectively to all future trials. so, also, in this case, this law applies prospectively to all future removals, qed. it is not retroactive. now, you may have an argument, although i don't think it's a very good one, that there are due process problems involved in this prospective law. but i don't see how you can call the law retroactive.
 i  i mean, is the only  you said, for example  is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the glacier bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the united states owns it?

now, you are urging that rooker-feldman which this court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have rooker-feldman, when you rush into a federal court and say, federal court, undo that state court judgment, i don't like it? rooker was just a paradigm case of that. why would you want to spread that doctrine? what is  what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?
that's the essence of an as-applied challenge. you say the statute's okay. it is just what is being done under this statute that is bad. you don't have to identify a bad statute. you're saying it is a perfectly good statute, but the president is  is violating the constitution in the way that he's applying it.
well, i'm not sure that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a core sovereign function.
well that's, that's what i wonder. if the court says that isn't what happened, and i see with my eyes that is what happened, what am i supposed to do?
 argument 
your honor, this is a refusal to disseminate the messages of the military recruiters. it is a refusal to send e-mails, post bulletins, and make arrangements for mutual exchange of ideas. it is "conduct" only in the sense that they are moving molecules, but it's speech that they are being forced to engage in. and i have to emphasize, this case is not about entry. the solomon amendment does not require schools to give entry to military recruiters, it requires them to give entry to a recruiter only if they provide entry to some

so, in other words, the partnership  we have a corporation where it's incorporated and congress said a principal place of business. we have a partnership where each partner is located. i don't know of any instance where for subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system you go to, as distinguished from personal jurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone is a citizen of every place where it does the business. is there  is there any other example? it's certainly not true of a partnership. it isn't true of  of a corporation. is there any other entity that would, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes 
that would 
well, they didn't contract it out to the government of iraq. they contracted it out to a private contractor. i mean, what  what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these  these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination. the whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.
so  so but at some point, there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're saying.
well, your honor, the reason it doesn't get mentioned is in that gordon the court held primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of conflict. and here the sec has expressed its opinion in its amicus briefs already. the court is aware of those positions laid out in our cert petition 
did you request  when the question of powerex  authority over powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case  the question up on appeal?
yes. navigable waters. (laughter.)
and 
no, but apparently you're saying we would not suppress because as long as the warrant specified the items to be seized and they didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection between the fact that they broke in and disturbed people in the night, when they were not authorized to, and their ultimate obtaining of  of the evidence. once again, it seems to me if we follow your  your reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.
based on race.
and then, indeed, the whole point of it  it's entitled "limited offset ability," parenthesis  "limited offset ability (extending only to debts of less than ten years)," end parenthesis. that's the title of the act, and then it says just what i say, repeating that.
 a reasonable reading of the ada, which i had always understood to be a significant change in  in terms of what rights are available to the disabled. and it seems to me quite different from turner against safley, which talks about the demands of the prison environment and the  and a high level of deference to prison administrators. do you think that approach is, in fact, consistent with what congress had in mind with the ada?
if the contract says 
 we offered 16 lay witnesses and their testimony, in addition to the experts. and i want to point this  make this point clear. the state wants you to believe that this issue only involves psychiatric expert testimony. it does not. and it involves lay fact evidence, just as in any trial. but these 16 lay witnesses talked about 
otherwise, the attorney general could just bring it all over again, a fresh complaint, and that would be wasted motion?
so what should we do here? should, if we are writing this, since it's never been held that it's patentable in this court 
might but not necessarily. and this court made very clear most recently in the nelson decision 
is that what your  i'm trying to understand this.
not must. and truly with things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?
the money has to be central to the violation.
that's a good argument. i like that.
yes.
that is not a 
which just begs the question, doesn't it? i mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in federal court.
that was 
mr. taranto, we'll hear from you.
well, if we don't view this case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce canada's tax laws  suppose we don't view it with that lens  then does that put it outside the so-called revenue 
justice breyer, i  i agree that 
it does not appear that they are.
i thought you said that on the capital offense, the killing could be with or without intent.
what  this 
yes, but if it was not instructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not correct?
well, i don't think 
no, i don't. i don't believe  let me frame the  your  your question, if i may, for you. section 5 indicates the united states would retain all of the lands that it presently holds. section 6(m) then makes the submerged lands act applicable to the  to the  to alaska. in doing so, it recognizes that there are some lands the united states would continue to retain, provided it meets the requirements of the submerged lands act. the particular exception we're concerned about here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, if lands are retained by the united states. this court said in the arctic coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the submerged lands act, that it had to be made plain that the united states would be holding onto these lands. it doesn't require an express statement. it simply requires that it be made plain. now, our view is that these lands would be retained by the united states, quite apart from 6  the 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary judgment. and if you denied our motion for summary judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable. but in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) and we're focusing on that because the court's arctic coast decision made clear that 6(e)  and i quote  reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife  or reservations for the protection of wildlife.
not necessarily excluded. it's really noncommittal on the point.
well, couldn't one regard a new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for judgment as a matter of law? that is, that's the larger thing, but at least a new trial. don't let  the judgment as a matter of law says, "don't let this verdict stand." so, one could say, "we won't give you a judgment, but we will order a new trial."
 may i stop you 
justice breyer, i think  i think i either misstated my answer to you, because i was trying to 
 it was  the new trial request had to do with liability 
how could  how could court conclude that the state's evidence was strong without making  without finding, in effect, that the state's forensic witnesses were credible?
 that there is 
that's my threshold point 
well, your honor, i think what  what that's saying  and i know that was the argument made in the solicitor general's brief  is that you can discriminate against one component of interstate commerce, those carriers that want to actually compete and do intrastate business in the state, as long as you give a benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those who just wish to operate in the  in the state of michigan in interstate commerce.
because i think that's sort of what justice  judge jofla thought was going on here.
it's a compromise of claims that could be brought.
the only way i would just  you know, the only point i would make with respect to that is that i do think that in finley this court's opinion cast some doubt on the entire pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines, and i think that 1367(a) is clearly designed to  to eliminate that issue going forward because it says there is a role. there is now a  an express provision from congress to the courts of supplemental jurisdiction. and then the question is under what circumstances does it apply. so to go back to the owen case, you know, we all assumed that there was ancillary jurisdiction over the third party claim. this statute makes it absolutely clear that there is jurisdiction over the third party claim because it  it extends to that claim. and we know that by the express language of the provision. it wouldn't have changed anything if you accept the idea that the court had inherent authority to do that. if you question that, then this is the basis on which that jurisdictional grant is provided. and so that is an important part of 1367(a) that affects 
no. if you had my test, you'd win this case.
well, then why are you paying it, if you  if you don't think you owe it?
 motion.
well, again it depends on how one defines those terms. and i don't take issue with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that this became a subsidiary 
we don't  well, we don't know how that can be. we don't know why the  we do not know why the state court dismissed the action.
i think it does contradict your opinion, justice scalia. your opinion said that petitioner's mitigating evidence had little or nothing to do with the inquiries of the special issues, and your opinion also said that the nullification instruction, no matter how clearly conveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not solve that problem.
 in fact, you have a driver of the truck, the postal truck, and what he does is, he puts the mail in the truck, so my skis, which i have shipped by mail, happen to stick out the side, and, as he walk  drives along, he just mows down the pedestrians. [laughter.]
i don't think 
yes. yes. and what crawford  what we believe crawford was saying  well, crawford said that the sixth amendment right to confrontation is bedrock. it didn't say that that decision altered our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair trial. that is the standard. not whether or not the sixth amendment is bedrock. in fact, if you look at the case of gideon versus wainwright and betts versus brady, in betts versus brady this court had held the sixth amendment right to counsel was not applicable to the states through the 14th amendment. gideon overruled betts versus brady and said that the sixth amendment right to counsel was applicable to the states under the 14th amendment. that alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial. in one case, we're saying rights of counsel is not one of those bedrock procedural elements. is not, therefore, applicable to the states under the 14th amendment, betts versus brady. in the next case we're saying right to counsel is it implicit in the constitution. it is an essential to the fairness of a proceeding, and it is therefore applicable to the states under the 14th amendment. that truly alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial. in contrast, when you look at crawford vis-a-vis ohio versus roberts, the  there's a real distinction there. in both cases, we know that the right to confrontation is essential and federal and one of those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair proceeding. therefore crawford doesn't alter our understanding of what elements are or are not essential to  bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding. instead it modifies the contours 
well, here the rolling of the eyes, first, is uncorroborated by the trial judge. he says, quite frankly, i did not see it. and in his ruling, he does not credit that rationale.
why  in  in 
well, your honor, i think the fact that there hasn't been a lot of these challenges that the government has been able to point to, indicates that this may not be a big problem.
exactly. and as i indicated to you earlier, justice stevens  that in a sense that's not a hypothetical. that's the totten decision itself. william lloyd was  or at least alleged that he was employed by president lincoln to engage in those services. and in answer to justice scalia's question, if william lloyd happened to be an employee of the  of the comptroller of currency or something, he could still sue to get whatever remedies he had 
no. no. we can't forego limits on our jurisdiction simply by granting the question.
no, i don't think so, because the real issue, in terms of steffel, is whether you can say that the party is being coerced. and, at least in your hypothetical, you could say that they have 
mr. himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points? you started out by saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the ninth circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we are deciding the question as a matter of first view instead of review. does the government urge that we dispose of those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed of by the ninth circuit?
let me answer both of those questions, if i can, your honor. certainly, this court has held, repeatedly, that the twenty-first amendment did not, in any substantial way, completely repeal congress' affirmative power under the commerce clause. it said that in midcal and capital cities. but we would argue that if congress acted in a way which completely removed state authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be sold and the terms under which it could be sold  for example, if congress said all states must be dry  then we would argue that the twenty-first amendment wouldn't allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any state authority.
yes.
but you're making the concession only for purposes of this case. that is, in another case you would be free to say the word "attempt" is good enough; you don't have to spell out in the indictment a particular overt act. official
well, whether it's required under the eighth amendment, or not, is for you to decide, obviously, but we think 
as justice ginsburg pointed out official earlier, the citations that they have used in their brief are to the characterization of philip morris' argument. but if you look at 30(a) in the petition  and that second paragraph there starts out with "using harm to others as part of the ratio may have been correct under the plurality opinion in txo"  and then you jump down to, "however, it no longer appears to be permissible if it ever was."
this  the facts of this particular case have not been before a  a court in washington, your honor.
certainly, this court's decisions indicate that, in some instances, there can be in rem decisions which 
but if i'm writing the opinion and i put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that i then answered necessarily justice ginsburg's question in the negative.
your claim arises out of how we handled the mail, not how handled a vehicle, not how we handled a building, not how we handled 
thank you, mr. castanias. mr. coleman, you have 8 and a half minutes left.
future dangerousness is  is what 5 we would submit to the court.
 in final adjudications 
i  i 
he could do this: he could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing. but suppose he doesn't do that. then, if you take your view that there's a presumption in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the guideline?
can 
that is a sentencing error.
in 
i don't  so what? i don't understand what conclusion that leads to.
well, justice souter, i don't think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect, precisely because what you have with respect to the claim that the geneva conventions applies  okay, that claim could be brought to the military commissions, but they could adjudicate it and say that the geneva conventions don't apply here, for any number of reasons. and i think that this idea that there needs to be an article 5 proceeding 
right, but it could also be 100 percent.
yes.
yes, but what you call 
i'm suggesting in that  in the  excuse me  in the administrative law context, which is the context in which congress was legislating under this statute, that that is, indeed, the established conception of that term.
you know, the evidence is undisputed that one officer made the statement, another officer said no, they left, 30 minutes went by. what exactly did she overlook?
well in some  if she's denied a pay raise and she's aware that other people are getting substantial pay raises  i don't think it's that much different than somebody else getting the promotion and me not getting that promotion.
we don't believe that was the intent of congress.
but  but the, what was happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to encourage the use of illegal drugs.
well, for example, he shall not excessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with persons who 
justice o'connor, this court's decision in kosak tells us that one of the main purposes in enacting the federal tort claims act was to allow private persons to be able to make claims against the postal service from motor vehicle 
well  well, but it is because he  it hasn't been found retroactive yet and he can't file 
well how about how  how the defendant was charged in this very case? mr. himelfarb thought that it was plain from that charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a principal. and you must take the view that this charge, this information was inadequate to identify him as principal.
when can they do it? when can they do it? you didn't allege here that it was in anticipation of any particular proceeding. you say they can't do it once they know that the investigation is on the way. but your theory in this case is that they can't do it, whether they know the investigation is on the way or not. they can't destroy any evidence that might be the subject of an investigation.
i think  i think they would say that that  that there's something different about general taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes. but i don't think there's any basis in this 
is that because the damages are slight or because there's a defense that is successful? what has been the defense in these tort cases?
no.
that's correct, justice ginsburg.
 or primary activities.
it's  there's no precedent that 
and if not  if not, what's the difference?
i understand that, but the essence of the violation was not the entering; whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases you're talking about, the essence of the violation was the entering. here, the entering was perfectly okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give the advance notice, that made it bad. and that, it seems to me, creates a different situation.
what  what is an example of an insignificant nexus under the swancc test?
well, i  i think, justice kennedy, the easiest example to  to see why this 
is the requisite standard, knowledge of falsity.
oh. (laughter.)
is in the chair the same thing as on the chair?
so if the record showed that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to voluntarily waive those constitutional rights, wouldn't the district court be able to reexamine that?
the reason for that is because physical products 
i think  i think that's right.
 the minute he 
and would you agree, if the statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference report?
i think the  i think the record suggests, as at least in the testimony of mr. johnson, that it is a de facto segregation system which exists after the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day period, and so it would be hard for the state of california to provide  to provide that data.
 a fallback position.
oh, i 
but  but the court has  has always articulated that the rules  well, in turner and o'lone, the court articulated that the rules are different in prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison administration and the  and the problems of subjecting 
i'd like to address the point that the government makes about how this would supposedly affect the sec's enforcement authority 
well, the statement of reasons, your honor, allows again for there to be communication on both sides. so that if the statement of reasons turned out to be based upon false information 
it wouldn't be an abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment later on. and then presumably the ruling would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.
with respect, justice souter, h(1) never spoke to the question. an earlier provision, d(1), had very different language, in an earlier provision of the statute, that spoke with greater clarity. i'll grant 
okay.
sure.
but, your honor, the problem is  is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.
the police told her to continue to wait. they strung her along, your honor. that's  the crux of the problem here is that she relied upon the police to enforce her restraining order. they told her to hold on 
or  or civil litigation. there is no  there is no exclusion. yes, that's correct.
can i ask you, the point i don't understand when you say the  the component is the disk that contains material, i understand that because here is a separate piece; it's a disk. you plug it in; it has the information on it. but then you say, if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the component. but the hard drive is not a separate thing like a disk. and when you say you put it on the hard drive you have nothing there but  but  but ons and offs. you have nothing there but the  but the thought.
if it's  excuse me, your honor. if it still presents a question of federal law, yes.
no, the  in general terms, when you speak of "general interpretation," i suppose i think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes with the following idea. congress did not intend to try to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the justice department to pick and choose. that's a notification problem. it's also because we don't want one law, "it is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the attorney general." you know, i mean, we want to have narrow criminal statutes. now, is it reasonable to start with that frame of mind? and if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against you in this case?
yes, your honor. and, again 
 in income?
fine. we had a context there where we supported it, but in the process said the sniff, the dog sniff, was not a search.
could you elaborate just a little bit for me on why you think this case is different from justice scalia's hypothetical with the 17 people? because my concern is there  here you say once the triggering event takes place, then you do  the probable cause comes to fruition or whatever. how is that different than his hypothetical?
i mean, she  she wanted something from 911. what did she  what did she want? did she want the police to come over and arrest her husband? was that  or 
justice o'connor, i can't tell you there isn't a difference between the treatment of schedule 1 substances 
no, i don't think  i don't think reasonableness is the right way to think about it, justice breyer. it is not a  in our view, it's not a categorical question of whether a particular filing deadline is reasonable or not in the view of the court.
i suggest it's very absurd to call that waters of the united states. it's a drainage ditch dug  you know, dug by the municipality or  you know, or a gutter in a street. to call that waters of the united states seems to me extravagant.
well, what it asks for is to authorize a subsequent state habeas proceeding based upon the president's determination, which he characterizes as the predicate for a new claim. and if that is correct, then there is yet another problem to his getting relief here, which is that he has failed to exhaust what he claims is now the predicate.
can you tell me a hypothetical instance in which where an as applied challenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue on its face? the procedure has to take place within 24, 48, 72 hours. how would as applied challenge take place? you know, i read all the doctors' testimony in this case, hundreds of pages, and i'm familiar with the area generally. but it takes a while to get up to official speed. i don't know if you could just go to a district judge and say i need an order, the judge would take  would have to take many hours to understand that.
we  we don't think that a national banking association is a citizen of a state in which its principal place of business is found, insofar as that might be different from the state in which its main office is located.
well, my argument would be that the habeas rule 11 provides that, to the  to the extent that the civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal habeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied. and i think that rule 11 compels a reading that if you have one application that is inconsistent with aedpa's provisions and the framework of habeas corpus, and another interpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go with the interpretation that is consistent with aedpa.
that's right. this court is bound by the kansas supreme court's interpretation of the statute. and what's happening here is, when the jurors do settle on equipoise, in whatever way they settle on equipoise, the fact of the matter that  is that in either of  either of the two cases i've  well, either in  in three cases i've described, the jurors are following their instructions, and, in either of these situations, the defendant is being sentenced to death only as a death-eligible defendant, because that's the only constitutionally required decision that's actually been made by the jury in that situation. and to go back to justice breyer's hypothetical about the box from the last argument, the legislature has determined that the individuals will be separated out as a result of equipoise, but there is nothing about that situation, them being in that box, that separates them from any other generic death-eligible defendant. and that's the problem with this equipoise provision. and, yes, the kansas supreme court found that it can happen. this court is bound by that interpretation. the state concedes that. and, therefore 
the government says on that branch of it, well, the fees  the lodestar fee, that's one thing. a court awards it, but that's quite different from the one-third/one-half even contingent fee. the court has control over the fee shifting, but we're not dealing with any court award here.
i should hope not. i mean 
i suppose arguably it could. in my view, the statutory provisions of section 1307 have to be applied to the question of conversion. so i think 
i don't 
try this hypothetical. the relator says: i know that they've been cheating the government because i, i observed the president of the company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and another person, and at that meeting i suspect they were devising this scheme to defraud the government. it turns out there was indeed a scheme to defraud the government, but that meeting never occurred. it wasn't the president of the company who went into the meeting. it was charlie chaplin. and the facts are totally, totally wrong. does he get money?
so  so the state can get mouse-trapped in this way. in  in the first case, it doesn't take the case up because not too much has been lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh, by the way, everything has been lost. and you say that we can't review that because  because the  the state didn't  didn't challenge kleypas at the time.
justice breyer, if you do not want to decide that question, you don't have to decide it.
i think that 
no, no. he asked me to say something that  that would  would help his concerns. what i'm trying to say 
and both would be all right because what's the difference between not getting as much appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct information had been out there and getting less than you would have gotten. i mean, in both cases the shareholder is affected the same way. they didn't get as much in one case. so you're not distinguishing between those. i think you're agreeing that in both cases the  the discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well. that shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't she?
it is being copied. there isn't any question that it's being copied, justice stevens. the stipulation which is in pages 44-a through 47-a of the petition appendix contains the words  this is words to which respondent stipulated  foreign-made copies replicated object code, foreign manufactured copies, foreign replicated object code. what happens, justice stevens, is that the golden master of the disk which contains the physical manifestation of the object code is read by a machine somewhere outside the united states, looked at and then copied onto another physical medium, either a hard drive or a disk. many hard drives, many disks. those foreign replicated physical tangible copies are then installed in computers and they become components of those computers.
the court could certainly come out that way on prudential grounds as a reason to avoid deciding a hobbs act issue. but, in our view, the hobbs act question is a fairly easy and straightforward one. and the seventh circuit's opinion is going to create mischief if left untouched.
i say the actual question is even one step removed. it's whether it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you conclude, which is wrong.
but in williams and flynn and all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they went, it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court with shackles. and in the case that went for the government, the extra officers in the courtroom. we haven't had a case, have we, where it is spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's being attacked?
your honor, i don't think that  again, i don't think that you need to decide those questions in this case. this case goes to what's at the very core of the twenty-first amendment, whether states can decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and whether or not states 
but you're willing to acknowledge  and  and the government concedes that you can have a different standard when the  the basis for the selective prosecution happens to violate the constitution from the standard you apply where the basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the constitution, such as i'm prosecuting him because he was mean to my brother-in-law. okay?
well, section 1519, enacted subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than 1512?
your honor, i think the reason that the number of employees should be different  treated differently is because we go back to the aldinger question, and the aldinger question is this court has to decide did congress want to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower federal courts.
yes, it would 
your honor, school districts can do many, many things through race neutral means that they could not do with race discrimination.
the answer  pardon me 
 one of the problems 
what was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?
does it say that? i would have thought it said that there has to be a final judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of the state court concerns that application which is still pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90 days in your view.
suppose there had been  suppose there had been very rough water 
well there are certain portions of the decision that talk about a plausibility requirement but when it turns to the specific area of a section 1 complaint and a complaint alleged on parallel conduct, i agree with you, justice scalia, that that's the only interpretation i can draw from that passage. the court held that if you allege parallel action unless there are no set of facts that can be proved, and it's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you cannot dismiss that complaint.
that do not rise to an obtaining?
does the record tell us what time of day it was?
does that, does that general statement that you just made apply to all circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship might be involved? for example, in the course of teaching a class in shakespeare would your rule prevail?
 purposes, but they are highly classified, highly controlled substances. they are the  the substances that are at issue here are the most highly controlled lawful substances. and i think if you go back to the history of the harrison act, it's been clear since the very first prosecutions under the harrison narcotics act of 1914 that the federal government's ability to regulate medicine was going to have an incidental effect on the state's ability to regulate medicine. i mean, states had much more of a laissez attitude towards  laissez-faire attitude towards the opium trade, but that was really displaced by the 
no, they wouldn't be acting  other than the one transaction, "we'll give you one particular benefit in this new development progress  project, with no further participation as a market participant or anything like that," that would  it seems to me that would fit right into your analysis.
no. we 
did the government at any point tell the  tell the court, your honor, we think the act requires you to make a specific finding and we request you do that?
counsel, with respect to the contribution limits, what  what makes this case different from the  the shrink pac case from a few years ago?
i am. justice ginsburg, i am. 5 months ago, as you know, when 
the definition statue of  of deadly weapon doesn't. it's 
is there a discharge if you have a simple waterwheel in the river? is that a discharge?
why, why would the secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula should be? which is the power he had before. i mean, one must think that there must have been some pressures from elsewhere when the secretary goes in and says take some power away from me, please.
i mean, they  they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?
that's right. and  and i think, your honor, that stems from the  from the way the statutes are structured. beginning many, many years ago, in washington we had what we called a deadly weapon enhancement. and so there was no distinction made between any kind of weapon. in 1995, the law changed. there was a distinction made as to firearms. the  the penalty was increased as to firearms. and so beginning that time, there was a material distinction depending on the weapon that was used. but i think that 
well, there is no evidence in this case that the judge referred to a police report.
no indication of dilatory tactics by the plaintiff.
why? why is that reasonable? i mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered alone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered with a tie-in? i mean, if  you know, if i say, you know, i'm selling you a windshield alone, i guess i'm offering a windshield. but if i say, you know, you've got to buy the windshield with a car, am i any less selling you a windshield?
we had a stipulated judgment.
i would because when we go through the comparative juror analysis and look at the record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for example, on youth are not used for similarly situated white jurors.
what is the 
no, congress didn't say that.
well, does  does fifra require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item can be used for?
 terrorist, for example.
 first part of the analysis.
very well, mr. draper. mr. robbins, we'll hear from you.
what about  what about the other  the other sites?
 this doesn't seem to me normal usage. i don't think if  you know, if you see a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the rapids of the colorado "discharge" into the colorado. you're usually talking about a different body of water. you could say the green river discharges into the colorado. likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you know, "the waterfall on this river discharges into the river." it's part of the river. but if it were a waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you would then say that, you know, "the waterfall discharges into the colorado," or whatever river it enters at that point. it seems to me very strange to talk about a river discharging into itself.
if, in miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from  not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water  - with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think miccosukee would have come out the same way?
well 
 of anyone who's cutting beef.
 as that term 
no, your honor. actually this policy was applied in a california case after the johnson case was decided in california to strike down a race-based prison policy. so there  there certainly are instances when the inmate could 
yes.
okay.
well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission.
that's not what is happening here, justice kennedy, especially when it is tied in to that, to send a message and then he also goes on to talk about the consequences. if you don't sentence this person to death, then the animals will reign in the jungle and we can't have that in a civilized society and there's no point in having jurors, the dope peddlers prevail. you put all that together, he is telling these people as the prosecutor in this county. if you don't give this person the death penalty there will be all these adverse social consequences. and you wrap all this up; there is no conscientious prosecute who could possibly believe that these statements were proper. no. this argument is an outlier; it is beyond the bounds; it contains essentially improper comments in virtually every category that this court 
justice souter, respectfully i  i disagree that the two parts of the  that the two parts of the sphere of the scheme can be broken apart like that. it's one scheme. they have  the  the petitioners have to defraud the state of new york. they have to not only mislead the state of new york, but fend off the state of new york, which frees up the cash which, as the chief justice pointed out, enables them to do two things. first, it enables them to offer lower prices, which does competitively injure my client. second, as we allege in the complaint, in the amended complaint, they took all those cash proceeds and they took them to the bronx and they opened up a competing location where they did not previously have one.
no. well, those people will probably be seeking political asylum. aleksandr solzhenitsyn  under the government's interpretation, nobel prize winners would be precluded from  solzhenitsyn did 8 years in a soviet prison because he said nasty things about joseph stalin. two american women in afghanistan, before the fall of the taliban regime, were arrested and convicted because they possessed bibles. now, the government says, well, these are anomalies. these don't occur often. but congress had to be aware of the possibility of tinhorn dictatorships all over the world having court systems that were so devoid of due process that we have to take a look at whether we want to 
no, i know it. but would you have had any other claim that you would have asserted, had that been done?
his exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that mr. cochran owes him money.
plus other  plus other damages.
your time is up, but i want to ask you one yes or no question. in your view is software patentable?
your honor, if there is a clerical error, rule 36 gives the trial judge the ability, and the power, and the authority to correct an error which is purely clerical. i refer you to the case of contreras-rojas, which was this exact defense. official
what if  what if the judge had specifically stated i'm putting him in irons because the man is  is violent enough towards himself or others that i'm worried about the safety of the jury.
well, i just think you are going to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because if that example is one, are you going to require 100 percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50? once you go down this road, i think it is just opening up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what is the impact on interstate commerce? what we have here now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute embargo. no waste generated in this town, in these counties, excuse me, can leave the state, period, end of story. it is no different, in effect, it is no less likely to breed resentment and retaliation than 
have courts of appeals approved those determinations?
 clement, i'm interested in another statute that has applicability in the circumstances, and that's section 1983 and the prison litigation reform act. under the  under the prison litigation reform act, if you're bringing a constitutional claim under section 1983, you have to exhaust your prison remedies before you can do that. and that is not the case here, is that right?
interpreted section  the use of the word person in section 1983.
i think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. these are gangs. these are guns. this is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.
it's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a 
right, and the  the guy in charge of the dredge does control the movement of it.
 an attempt to 
i think that  i think that the  the answer is that congress designed the system to resolve all those issues in state court first. i think one of the things that needs to be kept in mind is that an unexhausted claim is, by its very nature and by definition, a claim where there's an available remedy in state court.
yes. and it's 13 u.s.c. 1724, and it talks  or it defines the "demand" as the order to pay. and then, the definitional provisions, in turn  when they're talking about what commences the action, it says that the order to pay "commences" the action. and so 
the case is submitted.
in my case 
i do agree with that, justice stevens.
in other words, can they have it  would it be an abuse of discretion in an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture case?
right.
right. i meant  i'm not sure. i mean, is it a  is insufficient evidence a typical ground for asking for a new trial?
yes, your honor. and  and just to be clear, i  i don't think the commissioner has ever taken the position that all class actions don't present the  the possibility of the attorney's fees portion of the award being included in  in the class member's gross income. now, there are real enforcement issues, as a practical matter, to trying to  to trying to implement that. you can imagine a number of class actions 
well, is your position no tributaries or some tributaries?
if, for example, the judge saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor had hunches about jurors over and over again and they just happened to be black most of the time. that would not justify a  a batson challenge.
but they  the  the press of work force them to  to divide into one-judge divisions.
in your view, if as the jury was instructed in this case there was proof of monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a violation of the sherman act?
well, would you comment 23 specifically on your preferred position which starts at 24 the very  as i understand it, starts at the earliest 25 date, which would be the date of the state conviction?
i read a biography of john adams recently. i recall that he didn't think highly of them. (laughter.)
well, not in that case, where the  my hypothetical was, where the hearing officer has awarded services 
just say some. we want to  we're going to make a decision there will be some white teachers and some african-american teachers in the other. and we're going to do it no matter  if the constitution permits it. and that's our only motive.
no. you would lose a treatment case.
if  if you understand as i  that four people on the court took a broader view that congress didn't want to get into this matter, and restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; but five took the historical view. now, if we're in the historical view, which we are, that was the majority. at that point, i want to know how you think this case should come out. what words should be written there if i'm thinking of the next case? and after you win this case, if you do, the next case will simply be precisely the same as yours, but the lawyers, having acted 5 minutes quickly  more quickly, will mix up all the funds. now it's commingled and all we have is exactly the same with every future case that you have, and now the pension fund can't get a penny back of the money that it loaned that it should get back in good conscience. no doubt about it. a promise, good conscience, and they can't get a penny. now, you have the interest in telling me what words this court should write, other than overrule great-western, that will prevent that result from coming about. i would like to know your 
the initial contact with the police department we're saying has to involve appropriate processes 
you don't have any  you're not suggesting to us that the grand jury that indicted him for intentionally attempting to enter the united states at or near san luis would not have official indicted him if the indictment had gone further and said, and he submitted false ids?
but it  it doesn't advance the date of eligibility. it advances the date at which the parole board will take another look. the only eligibility is an eligibility to take  to have another look taken and not an eligibility for release.
no, but isn't your  in the answer that you just gave, and an answer which you have, in fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with steiner  steiner didn't say there is a separate category of integral activities. steiner said that activities which are integral are part of the principal activity. and isn't your argument premised on denying that identity?
 to the seventh circuit. and the seventh circuit then had to interpret what this court decided. and 
thank you, counsel. ms. snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.
thank you, mr. waxman.
and what's your response to it?
it does not apply of its own force. it applies because two parties in the united states contracted that it would apply. is that it?
i thought that's 
how about reckless disregard?
you may consider it as an anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard it as a violation of section 2.
that's right, and  particularly taking into account the reasonable reliance  the category "reasonable reliance" is designed to take  is designed to 
you either agree with justice 4 kennedy or not.
i respectfully disagree.
does your argument draw a ring around ira's? it was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.
well, justice souter, i think you have to look at the regulation of drug abuse and ask, to what end was congress regulating these substances?
before you do that, may i just ask one short question?
thank you, counsel. mr. fisher.
as opposed to adopting a completely different procedure entirely  a different protocol entirely.
it's the same cards with the same numbers. we just add more cards in order to reflect the extent to which each lea contributes to the overall picture.
i agree.
justice ginsburg, in isolation, we admit that the word "transmission" could have the broad interpretation that the government as  is urging this court to follow. but you have to look at the term "negligent transmission" in the context of the whole exception. and if "negligent transmission" were to be given the broad interpretation that the government urges and the third circuit found, then the words "loss" and "miscarriage" in the exception would be superfluous. and we also know that this court, on prior occasions, has indicated that the canon that "words are known by their associate" applies in construing exceptions to the federal tort claims act. and in  that canon tells us that when you have words that are in a group, they should be given like meaning. and we know that only mail can be lost, only mail can be delivered to the wrong location. and, as a result, it's pretty clear that the term "negligent transmission" deals with the mail, itself. and 
no, it doesn't. it certainly bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it seems to me.
even though the identical accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the vessel isn't moving.
like a  like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?
well, this court spoke to that in knights and said, unanimously that the  in knights, it was a probation condition, but i think that it  obviously, the same analysis applies here  that the imposition or acceptance of a  of a search condition by a parolee or a probationer results in the severely diminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by the parolee or probationer. and this court said that unanimously in knights.
no, i did not mean that. don't take me literally on that. for heavens sakes, i'm from brooklyn. i'm very colloquial. i'm very sorry about that.
 i may, i'd 
that's correct. but the court  this court, in montgomery ward, noted that there may be inefficiencies if the district court rules on the jnov motion, but doesn't rule on the conditional motion for new trial, because if the jnov  if the ruling on the jnov motion is reversed on appeal, then there's a need for remand for further proceedings, and it's inefficient. but to return to the point about taking an appeal from a rule 50(a) motion, i think it would put a district court in an untenable position to say, "you can reserve ruling on the 50(a) motion, even if you think the evidence is insufficient," and, indeed, it's usually the better practice to do so, but, if you do that, and the jury comes back against the movant, the movant can take an immediate appeal, and you can be reversed on the ground that your ruling on the rule 50(a) motion was erroneous. there's simply no  by its  by the terms of the rule itself, the submission of the case to the jury, in the face of a rule 50(a) motion, is considered to be a reservation of the sufficiency question.
they might, but they haven't yet. a couple of times you've used this phrase cutting across ipos. are you saying there should be an absolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a single ipo?
yes.
 that you can't just make a federal  implied federal cause of action under the federal standards, from what we know. but then i was wondering, what if the arizona statute said that's what the private firm should do?
with respect, justice kennedy, i don't think that's born out in this record, it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform a d&x, often, in a majority of the cases end up performing a d&e. but the doctors that set out to perform a d&e, in dr. vibhakar's case she says a hundred percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment. dr. creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up with dismemberment.
well, i mean, i think  i think what that points to is the perils of  of using committee reports and statements 
well, for that reason, they're  for that reason, they're not likely to  in most instances, they would not be hostile to receiving that kind of information, if it was provided to them.
may i ask you what the 
thank you, mr. barnett. mr. richards, we'll hear now from you.
what's wrong with the analytical point that i just made?
that if the state 
your honor, i don't believe there should be an obsessive concern with religion. if the ten commandments are displayed as part of an overall display of law givers, like that frieze, it's permissible. but when you put sacred texts somewhere on government property, then the message is that the government is endorsing 
only if you think that excusing the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same thing, which i don't really think.
and isn't it 100 percent clear that there were a number of those addressees who didn't get the letter?
quite the contrary, i think it's a 
but my only 
there was not a trial below. so we don't have that fact. we believe that as in the scheiner case, these  these tendencies are inherent there. because of the structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has what this court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and that is to  for carriers, once they have paid this fee as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate commerce and to concentrate them into  in the state of michigan in the local activities. and that  in fact, the state acknowledges that. below, the state said that motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to the state of michigan in order to avoid these consequences. and even the michigan court of appeals recognized that, saying a local carrier would be discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.
okay.
there was no evidence, i think, to suggest that it did.
in other words, i thought the issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed whatever  for fourth amendment purposes, whatever permission might have been given. but, as i  i understood that there was no question  what is it?  - under rodriguez, at least  of her authority, facially to admit the police to the places that they went.
if you go  if you go 
yes, it will. (laughter.)
and the court says, "it's timely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'" but i thought  i said, in the opinion, i thought the court adopted that the words "on the merits" do not decide the matter.
what the numbers 
that's 
let me  let me ask you this. if  if your argument has force, why haven't we been having horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981 when the eeoc took the position that it takes?
congress said that.
we do that all 
we  we are going to also make the brady claim. in addition, your honor, if indeed that evidence was available to trial counsel, who did talk to mr. muncey, who was able to interview mr. muncey, and failed to ask mr. muncey whether he had had sexual relationships with his wife, even though trial counsel attempted ineffectively at trial to  to show that  that that semen belonged to mr. muncey. so it's one of those situations, justice breyer, where there is either brady for the state's failure to turn it over, or if it was available, it's another instance of ineffective assistance of counsel.
and here there was no reason given.
but if the first proceeding was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would lose under the second and successive objection in this case, right?
the answer is yes, i take it. in the case i put, the answer is you would think that you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments. so that eats into her general damages.
yes, your honor, it would.
 schools themselves 
but, your honor 
but the federal tort claims act is against the united states. it's not against the 
i apologize. the court can certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy, because those are illegal substances which are very injurious to health. and this court has noted that in bernonia and in earls, time and again, it is that these are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy sanctioned by congress, and also noted by courts across the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that schools are entitled to have a message going 
but you told me  and i want to make sure this is your answer  that it doesn't matter, that as long as the ship comes to a u.s. port as part of this overall journey, you  you answered that question and i thought that was your candid answer, that it doesn't matter that these  these particular cruise ships ply mostly u.s. waters and u.s. trade and are centered, even have their principal place of business in the united states. you're not concentrating on that category. you are saying that the ada applies so long as the ship puts in at  at a u.s. port, picks up passengers. it applies not only while it's in the port, but practically for every other place the ship goes. that's why i asked isn't this the united states rules the world on what  your argument you made.
now, why  why do you say that?
to be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the fourth official circuit than of duke. they had a somewhat different approach before the fourth circuit and then the fourth circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction.
i guess that gets back to the point earlier. i mean, do you agree with the discussion earlier that this act is not going to prevent abortions?
mr. cochran, you've started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines. 49, what was the other one?
i  i believe it does. of course, in this case we have both, a description of the crime and an identification of the perpetrator.
when i  when i was thinking about this problem, i looked at district 24. the thing that was interesting to me is that most of the neutral justifications that you describe  and they're certainly in the  in the five new districts that replaced it, but in the key part of the population that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it was before.
one  one visit per month. and  and how often do they go to the prison library?
that was an old fifth circuit case 
and do you have any case supporting that proposition?
yes.
may i go  may i go back to the textual argument that justice scalia was suggesting a little while ago? if we presume that normally a citizen is a citizen of only one place  there are multiple  there are other situations where you have a dual citizen  and that you would normally assume they're only a citizen in one place, then congress, in order to solve the problem of corporate headquarters in the private commercial world, corporate headquarters, a main piece of business, went out of its way to say corporations shall be deemed to be a citizen of two places  they made a special statute when they could be a citizen of two places, which overcomes the presumption that it's a citizen of only one place. but there's nothing to overcome the presumption that in 1348 they're assuming each citizen has only one place of citizenship because that statute just used the word respectively. it talks about many banks but in  respectively citizens of  of different states. but i think that's fully consistent with the notion, sort of the basic background notion, that one person has one  one citizenship; one corporation has only one place of citizenship.
but substantive offense is one thing. lesser included, i think you said earlier it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to the same punishment. so it is not lesser?
mr. browning, this argument that you're making, where you seem to be having great solicitude for the  for the whistleblowers, for the people who might be retaliated against  the respondent and the solicitor general answer your argument by saying in all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been available, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff barred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6-year limitation. yes, one could hypothesize these cases, but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in fact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of the false claim?
the  the issue of whether or not the hotel  whether or not the  san francisco's hotel conversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's objective was litigated with a vengeance. it was litigated to the point of dozens, if not hundreds of pages in the state court. the state court  the state courts made a number of subsidiary findings leading to their conclusion that, both on its face and as applied, the hotel conversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's legitimate objective of retaining low-cost rental housing for the elderly, the disabled, and the poor.
well, the statutes in this  or the sites or the  the elections themselves are close in time, and  and the statutes involving the petitioning have all been looked at as  as courts and have been found that this is a close enough connection to the time of the elections, that that time frame of petitioning and getting the requirements for  for petitions and the state recognizing the political party all fit comfortably within the confines of  of constitutionality.
i thought the evidence was that you're looking for a different degree of dilation if you're intending to perform d&e than if  and you're looking for a greater degree if you're intending to perform a d&x.
he has had a special  a  a long term and he is well-known and respected as a tax court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.
yes, sir.
well, the computation is vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as hostage for the payment of  of any shortfall. that's what you're doing, isn't it?
it's on page 5-6 of our brief. it's section 1702 of our 
i don't think that's what is involved in this case, your honor, because the district court found that the board's motives were indeed legitimate and that there was no basis 
 the subject?
is there any evidence in the record that the initial placing of two inmates in the same cell has ever had  has ever produced a racial incident?
yes.
(e)?
and on that, they say you don't have a cause of action unless you're able to prove an absence of probable cause.
the oregon question is part iv of our brief beginning on page 31 which would not be a national uniform rule. but what we're asking this court to do is simply, as narrowly as possible, to limit the assignment of income doctrine and do nothing more than that.
well, respectfully, i think that's exactly what justice stewart said. justice stewart in his concurrence did not espouse a broader theory than the one that the court adopted in flast. and he said he joined the judgment, the opinion of the court, and he said, i understand that to hold only that a federal taxpayer has standing to assert that a specific expenditure of federal funds violates the establishment clause of the first amendment.
that's correct.
but we 
there isn't a question. there is a question of whether it justifies the use of deadly force, to prevent this  this situation.
well, it might be related in the sense that the government's argument that there are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative. i was going to ask the government about that. on the other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that there is a medical opinion against it.
and would have the ability to continue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace until such time as there was a corrective disclosure.
and as  and as to those prisoners, was there a requirement that the  that the court's procedures be made applicable and so there would have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?
 my  my little story was inaccurate as to florida or accurate as to florida.
thank you, mr. phillips. mr. englert, you have four minutes remaining.
 the rehab act contains the same essential requirements as ada?
no, but if i understand you correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6 months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no tolling for that 6-month period.
well, epa has  has waived efficacy data requirements. right?
there's no scoring. you've got 25 points now, so you're pretty close to your goal or anything like  it's not 
this is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on congress's part here to provide a federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a federal employee's duty. it's not inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to specifically provide for review of that determination but then have that review take place in state court rather than federal court.
well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. i mean, you  we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. it seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.
mr. smith, you have 4 minutes remaining.
if an 18-year-old did the same thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.
well, i think it's  it's a matter of what  what is covered, what is mentioned in history. affidavit is one of those  those categories. letters, in particular, in raleigh's trial was another area that may have been problematic. and i think 
another real-world question. do we  do we have any  do you have any experience that you can rely on either to show that in fact these subsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the main qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought separately? do we know what's going on?
well is there a difference between, in your view, in the constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly safer? in other words, i take it we don't, you obviously were here for the discussion in the prior case. we don't have evidence on marginal significant. and do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal difference in safety, does that, is that still enough to override congress's interests in this case?
 the school district went first.
the plaintiff had  had no obligation to notify the state? there was some mention of a  of a obligation to cooperate. is there any statutory obligation under  i don't see it in the medicaid statute, but under arkansas law for  for the medicaid recipient to cooperate with the state?
i mean, you  you  you're stretching the probate concept from determining whether the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the will to also determining what goes into the probate estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and so forth. that to me is  is something quite different from probating a will.
your honor, there is material in the mckeon affidavit, which is in the joint appendix  mr. mckeon is the chair of the state liquor authority  but it's also the case that to suggest that because there is some option out there  and there's no firm evidence that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion  but the possibility that's there's some rule out there, because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to treat alcohol like any other product. and the twenty first amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that alcohol is unique, that it should not be open to 
but the american trucking association is  is willing to be thrown into the  into the briar bush apparently. it certainly involves no  no difficulty for your michigan intrastate truckers. all of their miles are intrastate. and the plaintiffs here say we're  we're willing to  you know, to provide figures showing how much of our carriage was  was exclusively intrastate if you want to apportion.
well, congress was concerned, justice alito, with the problem of abusive pleading. that much is crystal clear. and as part of that concern, congress was concerned that plaintiffs could readily allege fraud by hindsight, and congress may have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so not only by making a conclusory allegation of state of mind, but also making a slightly less conclusory allegation of state of mind by alleging facts that merely give rise to a reasonable inference of state of mind. if congress hadn't had that concern, it obviously could have codified the reasonable inference standard that was then in use by a number of other courts.
no, your honor, because again, remedies are a question of domestic law, so it's up to the domestic courts to decide what would be the appropriate remedy.
well, in the abstract case, it could be. i would argue, though, in this case it's not, because that was one use on a  you have a ten-page brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. and you  on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, kp permanent makeup. so 
well, i think that the 
thank you, counsel. mr. haltom, you have three minutes remaining.
that's exactly our point, that the state removed 
the board decided it liked the way things were going, so it kept it or something close to it.
talking about schools that are on the one end racially isolated. the solicitor general mentioned two of those. and talking on the other end about preserving the diversity that we had achieved through these years of effort in these north end schools.
well, the suit in state court, i assume, would  would only be  the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.
that's correct.
do  do you think the  the poaching argument stands up on any  any empirical basis?
justice scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the state of california, and which is rational to distinguish from 
you can be found guilty of murder when you didn't intend to kill?
no. justice ginsburg, there's a lot of speculation on both sides. i don't think there's any empirical evidence, but there is plenty of reason to think that there are many reasons that people choose not to join the union, whether from a free rider motivation, whether from just not being a joiner, any variety of reasons. some of them may be 
okay. now 
but the broad interpretation that the government asks for, and that the third circuit followed, was that "negligent transmission" covered anything that occurred to the mail from the time the mail was dropped off at the post office until it arrived at a third  to the third person. so, with that broad definition of "negligent transmission," anything that occurred, whether it was a loss of the mail, whether it was misdelivered to the wrong location, would be covered, and that would make the words "loss" and "miscarriage" superfluous.
there is a  yes, your honor. there is a factual dispute as far as whether deputy scott's vehicle collided with mr. harris' vehicle or vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a material dispute. we believe that the fact, the undisputed fact, that mr. harris was driving at such exceptionally high rate of speeds  and to put in context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed, and of course 
mr. nager, i'm lost. what  what part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?
well, they did it there, they didn't do it here. to me that suggests the opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.
that's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them. well, let me  i have a question. i'm trying to test this. suppose that i have a company in maine. all right? and i have  i decide all my  i  i have all maine plates, by the way. and i decide i want my  now, let's  one word is license plates. i'm going to talk about plating. another word is the icc insurance. let's call it a decal. and the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. all right? the $100.
that's correct, justice ginsburg. that's right.
well, i think the problem with that sort of rule, justice breyer, is that it risks error, because california's standard is so indeterminate, and at very little  it gets very little benefit. because there's  there is no real harm  there's no real harm to the federal interest here just because we have a conclusive presumption. the very nature of a conclusive presumption is that sometimes there will be cases that don't fit the presumption. but, on this record, and on anything i've seen from my review of california procedure, there's nothing to suggest that a  the federal interest in avoiding substantial delays is compromised by the specific rule that the ninth circuit has adopted. and the ninth circuit has adopted a 
that's right. and as a result the claims and the process of adjudicating both kinds of claims are not significantly different.
is it  is it at the arraignment or the  at the earlier booking in the police station?
and one 
that's an equal protection claim.
well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?
well, but then, getting more members to  converted to the religion would not be diversion.
mr. vladeck, why  if that was what congress had in mind, then how do you explain the multiple statutes that are listed in casey that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?
so, it would uphold this.
what is the contrary of  of mitigating? i  i would assume 
well, to get back to justice souter's questions, could you answer it this way? let's assume that some members of the court simply accepted the proposition that money buys access. and  and i don't think maybe we can take judicial of that, but i  i think that's a common sense conclusion that we can reach. and you tend to fight this in your brief to say that this doesn't happen. i tend to doubt that. i tend to think money does buy access. what  if  if we or i were to conclude that, what would follow?
maybe because they thought they had to file on time.
so as to these, the  the marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.
 definitely clear or otherwise made plain. yes.
you're not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroad's official negligence.
but it isn't probated. that's  it is, indeed, a will substitute. the whole purpose of doing it is to avoid probate.
 way that these laws are not.
i would think prejudice to the defendant should be a factor, and if the defendant is misled by what the judge says into not putting on part of the case that otherwise would have been put on, that's a pretty serious matter.
no, i don't think so.
may i ask you whether there are statutes in various states that allow an officer to get a no-knock warrant?
 traced 
 beyond a 
thank you, mr. verrilli. the case is submitted.
what extinguished the aboriginal title with respect to this aspect of the argument, and then i will move on to the treaty of fort schuyler and the treaty of canandaigua. what extinguished the aboriginal title is the passage of time and the fact that this land has been under state and local jurisdiction for 190 years and this court observed, in hagen and rosebud sioux, and i acknowledge it was in a different context, but this is important, that stable rules of jurisdiction and sovereignty are important in situations like this where what we're dealing with is very few  1 percent of the land in the city of sherrill is owned by the tribe. the land is predominantly non-indian. and as this court observed in hagen and rosebud sioux, a finding that the land now comes back into tribal jurisdiction, to paraphrase, seriously disrupts the justifiable expectations of the community and that's not just a hypothetical in this case.
but you say 
well 
 can have a 
we do not contest the validity of the regulation.
well, that's this court's cases on prophylactic nationwide legislation, absolutely. you know, in tennessee versus lane, this court upheld nationwide prophylactic legislation on the basis of a record that included constitutional violations in only eight states. here, we have a record that touches on at least 37 states, if you look in pages 20 to 36 of our opening brief. in 
without a statute that uses the word shall enforce. do we know how colorado has interpreted that?
our position is the 100 percent claim  the default  as a default rule, when the state has been cut out and cannot make the reasoned judgment that the medicaid statute charges the state with making on these claims, that's a 100 percent rule. quite  our position, quite straightforwardly, is if the state was involved or if there was a jury finding of 50/50, you know, comparative negligence, then the medicaid claim gets cut in half because it  the  the state can consider two things, extent of liability and cost 
yes.
 i'm not putting the head-to-head in. just, one of his sales gets lower concessions; one, higher. that's 
well, i'll  i'll give you an example of a situation that is often trotted out as a problem under our reading of the statute, and we think  the irony of it is, i think, none of the parties actually think it's a problem, and i certainly don't, and that is, the problem of a rule 20 plaintiff who is not listed in (b). but let's just say a  a plaintiff comes in and files a  a complaint. there is complete diversity. clever plaintiff says, aha, here i am. i've gotten through (a). we're in court. now, i'm in (b) and i am  i'm a rule 20. i'm going to add some rule 20 plaintiffs, and i've got these folks who are not diverse and we're going to bring them in. well, we  we have cited cases, i think on page 33 of our brief, where it's perfectly clear that no court, i think, in its right mind is going to turn around 2 weeks later and say, oh, you got me. you know, we're going to have to let these nondiverse plaintiffs in. we're going to have to go forward with this case because you did it in the right order. if you had filed it all in one complaint, you'd be out of court, but you're a clever guy and you filed it in two different steps. so supplemental jurisdiction. you come in.
yes, your honor.
so, what am i supposed to look to, to decide which is 
no, there is a limitation, in terms of manner and scope.
well, the only  the only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence, i take it, is if they  if  if the defendants had had additional time to dispose of it.
what 
i thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.
yeah, i guess  look, your honor, i am not disputing that an information service has a component of it that's communications. it may, indeed, have a component of it that's communication. but what the fcc said in computer ii is that when you combine the  you combine the communications with, for example, the data-retrieval function, that that combination of things is no longer the two separate products, it is a new enhanced service that is beyond title ii. and, justice scalia, part of the evidence that these are not two separate products is, if they were, then congress never could have said if enhanced services were outside of title ii. computer ii would have to be wrong and overruled, even though it's now 20 
i suppose that if that provision weren't there, the court would have to decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant to the penalty, and not to the guilt. whereas, by just allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, "you only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and not to the guilt," we  the court does not have to enter into that item-by-item discrimination.
well, your honor, this is the final bill they voted on, and if they turned the page 
well, you can't square that with the near case at all. i  i mean, the  the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.
 that rather lengthy statement you made earlier, that the bacchus case didn't involve the importation of alcohol. but it did. i mean, the only reason that the in-state exemption was held to be unconstitutional was because you were treating out-of-state sellers differently. how can you possibly say that 
very well, ms. smith. mr. shors.
and 
well, we don't think, justice  mr. chief justice, that the "real party in interest" analysis even applies on the defendant's side, but it is  it would not apply to this extent. it's not for the courts, once they have a proper defendant, to be searching outside the record for possible jurisdictional spoilers once jurisdiction has been established. and this court's cases 
it is not final 
right, but you're saying this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a matter of law, consistent with the first amendment. is that correct?
well, how does that comport with what you just said?
that's quite a different lawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from the state's perspective, would allow the overwhelming number of applications of this statute where there is no dispute that it works well, to go forward.
do you have to have the fda's permission to start clinical testing?
that's today, mr. chief justice, to be sure. but tomorrow, when i go to the next dealer to  go to the next purchaser, the reason i didn't get that sale was because i didn't have enough capital to have the same quality of salesperson in place to make that sale.
yes, go ahead and answer the question.
 than this case.
the new evidence came to light some 6 months after his plea was entered and after the sentence was announced.
well, a respondent is entitled to defend on any ground supported by the record. but even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that there was an error and one assumes that it was  which is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing this, and the combination of lack of foundation and cumulativeness. it's hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality. but if we assume that it did, you have the two courts that applied the brecht standard here. and the district court decision here is nearly 100 pages long. it's a very careful, methodical analysis.
there are not any other offense  conspiracy provisions that this court has interpreted that had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).
i think if i understood the question, justice kennedy, i think no present claim, because the only thing you said that he knew is that they previously engaged in discriminatory actions.
could  is it possible that both dotson and johnson could get new hearings by  filing habeas 
but is it your argument that the state's evidence can't be considered at all, or that it can't be given more than a certain amount of weight? and if it's the latter, where do you draw the line?
i think that there's a high chance that could be  be excluded.
i was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.
well, it can't be an element. and that  obviously, there could be a circumstance where some special findings were made, in which case that might be beyond the elements. but it can't be an element simply because you shouldn't be double counting what's already established. the range is set by the elements of the offense, that all three terms are available from the jury verdict based on those elements. if you are going to make a selection within that range, it would have to be more than simply the defendant committed the offense. and that's the same with the federal guidelines. simply saying 
let me ask the same question a different way. if  since 924(c) includes some "mere possession" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c), doesn't that show that the way congress used "illicit trafficking in a controlled substance" is not in the sense official in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much broader, so that it can include "mere possession" offenses?
well, we prefer the formulation that, from the court's opinion in dura that says that the facts need to demonstrate some reasonably founded expectation that there is an unlawful agreement within the meaning of section 1 of the sherman act.
your honor, i think if someone is losing property because of this problem, then that person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de minimis threshold here. we have shown we own property, 200 miles of coastline which we're losing, and we think the standing is straightforward.
they wait until the taxes have been delinquent for 1 year. at that time, it's certified from the county to the state. they send notice saying that 2 years into the future, there will be a tax sale if the property hasn't been redeemed. even after that public sale, there's a 30-day redemption period. in this case the house didn't sell at the public sale. so then we started an entirely new process of the negotiated sale, which again involved notice and ultimately the property was sold at negotiated sale. so there is sufficient time after the state learns about the failure of the initial mailed notice to take further reasonable steps.
 that's not the hypothetical. suppose you sharpen the tools outside, by your locker, and then you  then you go for a 10-minute walk to get to the  and you carry the sharpened tool?
and  and you think it's clear that  as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the united states?
no, this decision  i'm not asking you about this decision. i'm asking you if a state, under the clean water act, were to say, "we have the following clean"  now you understand what i'm 
it was found at the guilt phase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?
yeah, but even in your example, the concern of congress is with the use of the drug to hurt people who do not understand that they're going to be hurt, and don't want to be hurt, and perhaps, in your example, the use of the drug to facilitate the violation of the law, that seems to me worlds away from what we're talking about here.
i said you may underestimate the lds. (laughter.)
well, and part of what  part of what i wanted to say also to justice breyer and i think also works here is it's  the suggestion seems to be that knock  that a fourth amendment violation  the question of whether one has occurred and the question of whether or not the  to apply the exclusionary rule are one in the same. and this court has never said that. to me that would be a dramatic changing of the law of this court. this court has always said those are separate questions, and i think petitioner's argument conflates the two. we first ask whether there has been a constitutional violation and then we say  this court has said the premise for application of the exclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged evidence is the product of the illegal government activity. so once we establish that there has been a constitutional error, the question becomes is the challenged evidence the product of it. and just like the touchdown is not the product of the taunting, the entry into the premises is not the product of the failure to knock and announce. it's the product of a warrant, which the judge issued commanding the police to enter.
that is absolutely our position, justice souter, that preclusion addresses all of these issues.
two separate violations, each of which violates the same statute?
 don't need to 
sloppy 
well, this court has made venue provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context and in the banking act precisely using the 
okay, but let 
well, actually the petitioners filed a notice of appeal before the 1292(b) motion had been decided and then sought a 1292(b) certification. i think they were trying to protect themselves by doing it both ways 
would you speak up a little?
but this 
but that's not an issue the court needs to reach in this case.
is there any precedent for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural bar?
correct.
well, your honor, i think you have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the judgment by which he's being confined. i mean, he 
that  they really didn't argue both. they  they  effect  that was the throwaway argument. they came in there  what  what i think is critical in both trials and later on in the proceedings is what they were urging, what they were recommending the  to the jury.
yes.
he was not given an answer. so what can one say? the district court decided  lest you assume that because he wasn't given an answer he doesn't have a case, the district court said, as hard as it is to prove these things, he has substantial evidence that they were picking on him solely to get the property, not because they didn't like him, not for some other reason; they were trying to get property for which they were unwilling to pay. it's doubtful that they could have taken it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the ability of the blm require proving necessity and there is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed this easement. there is plenty in the record suggesting that he couldn't access his own property as long as the roadway wasn't maintained in a passable condition, and one of the ways they retaliated against him was to refuse to maintain the roadway. the record is also clear that his business suffered greatly. so that if the result is that someone who is trying to insist that if you want my property, you have to take it by eminent domain and give me just compensation, can't get help in those other ways, this is crucial. what would have happened in kaiser aetna, if when the government said we think we have an easement to the laguna pond, instead of going to court, which they did and they lost, if they had said well we are going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram their motor boats into your sailboat? we are going to ruin your business in the kuapa pond until you give the public an easement. only a bivens cause of action which the court has recognized in other areas, in other constitutional claims  due process, free speech, eighth amendment  only a bivens cause of action is directly responsive to that.
certainly it is within the school's mission to discourage drug use. certainly it has many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint  certainly it can  it does not need to provide a forum in the school itself for students with a contrary viewpoint. but when a student is basically on his own time, whether it's outside of school 
and you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.
it seems to be that it wouldn't have been all that hard to do. i don't know.
well, but that  that doesn't necessarily follow.
well, the  the court of appeals ruled that the case should go back to the district court. we are asking this court to affirm that and send the case back to the district court, as a federal circuit ruled.
which court?
which are  which is the best authority abroad for you that  where they say, no, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we violated the treaty?
well, i  i just think that the whole statute makes a very great deal of sense. i mean, one question is, does the first clause of (a)  is  is that a gate you have to get through and once you get through it, you're done? i think the answer is no. i think  i think clearly you've got to have a case within the original jurisdiction under 1332, and if you lose it, the supplemental jurisdiction is a tail that falls off. it  it goes away.
in other words, a court of equity could not have taken the ring?
exactly.
 the matter is 
against the entire state 
juror 20 collins explains  mr.  trial counsel  defense counsel, explained at the hearing was a person of color but not african american. so the record shows, i believe, we have one african american on the jury and one other minority.
 but you say that a property taxowner, simply by being  simply by being subject to the property tax, does not having standing. isn't that your position?
why?
but in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. congress as i understood when it enacted our statute, it took language from the regulation; it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix.
okay.
 what time lapse 
yes.
well, is that  i mean, is that the  the real basis for the policy, that we  that washington does not want to make it difficult for  for arrestees to raise bail?
i think everybody makes their 
that would be 
but he did succeed. and then 2 we have to look at whether the petitioner has complied 3 with section 2255 of aedpa. and so we look to subpart 4 (4), do we not, in this case to answer that?
well but also access to clinics, in the the face act, which is also 
okay.
that's for purposes of the immigration law.
i have 
i'm still not sure of your test. it's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair, whether or not there's notice, which sounds like more sixth amendment than fifth. or whether it's not an indictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.
now, what do i look to in the record to verify what you just said?
the  the  you know, the traditional case. you're from one state, i'm from another state, i have a claim against you for at least $50,000, i sue you in diversity jurisdiction.
yes, your honor, it is in the briefs. it's  it has to do with the trulson study, and the trulson study indicated that the intake diagnostic centers of texas were not required to be integrated.
suppose it said that explicitly. would that  would that make this case come out differently?
but if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release. and i think that's the point that we're getting  let me  let me ask a  a sort of complementary question. is there any reason that these 
your honor, you are correct that we are saying that provides us also an independent source of our standing.
do they have a right in and of themselves  not as guardians  do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing? that's, that's the point i'm inquiring to.
 before he issues his final opinion 
well, acceptance of responsibility may present different issues, but we would submit that the fundamental problem with the constitutional rule that the oregon supreme court did expressly adopt is that it would effectively allow jurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher standard of proof at capital sentencing than the reasonable-doubt standard, which, after all, is the standard that applies in all other criminal contexts.
right. i mean, they already had the principal offender. they already had somebody sentenced to death for it.
okay.
analytically on a motion to dismiss, if there were 20, i agree that all should be  if all suffered the exact same competitive injury and the set of factors 
i can understand an approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you judge it on all these merit factors and other factors. but for a child entering the first grade, i don't understand this individualized holistic approach. what else is there other than that the child is of a certain age and therefore will enter a certain grade?
well, suppose we think it can't control? now, then what's open to us?
excuse me, you mean you can never decide this question until after the trial is completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a reasonable doubt?
why can't i say that steiner requires that interpretation of what constitutes a "principal activity" only for purposes of determining what is compensable, and that when we  when we come to examine the separate question, of when the workday begins, we can  we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned, a different interpretation of what is a "principal activity"?
and it would apply to all of the cases this court has ever held. in every single case involving an embargo or a local processing requirement or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in public ownership" you'd have the exact same case 
but the fraud is caused  the fraud causes other people to want to buy the security. they do so at a higher price. it causes the price to go up. it's "in connection with a purchase or sale," maybe not of the holder's securities. but it's certainly  the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for purchases and sales that caused the price to go up.
with all respect, i think if a single injection that doesn't take any particular risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that counts as a significant risk, then we might as well strike the word "significant" from the discussion in stenberg. and then i think what you have is that it's very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance for any marginal risk to maternal health.
we submit that it was unsuccessful in conveying properly what this court has official held and that is sufficient grounds for the oregon supreme court to uphold the trial court's decision.
are  are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that  a durational impact? wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? wouldn't  wouldn't it  assuming there was an ex post facto violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?
yes.
i'd like to make it clear 
even assuming the evidence, the historical evidence  assuming its relevance, as the fifth circuit did 
yes.
well, i don't know if you got to the third point you were going to make. you were outlining three different points. but it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other. you want to talk to us about the adequacy of the state court's finding. the respondent says what we  all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues. we want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect. those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and i sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point. did you see the same thing?
i think it would be a big difference if the phrase, including but not limited to, appeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not where the phrase appears. the phrase appears in, i believe it's, 1964(c) which deals with the  the civil remedies provision, and where 
yes, but, i mean, that  the part that's good can't save the whole thing, any more than in the  in the union case, the fact that some  the union dues could be used for some permissible purposes, saved the dues that were being used for impermissible purposes. you 
thank you, general. miss smith.
 of the time of that conduct.
well, the first  before the comma is the statement both of the action of the employer and the injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to exist, and then there's another requirement. the requirement is  is that the action and the  the effect of  the injury that's affected by it be  because of age. that is a conventional reference to intent. and the confirmation that it's a reference 
but a choice-of-law clause, justice ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be incorporated. i'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause that  that simply takes in every domestic statute.
no, no. i  but all right. now, i'm  i'm being facetious.
go  go through that again, would you?
yes, your honor. the a.s. kreider decision that we discuss in our brief is about was whether or not the sorter statute of limitations, ironically, in the case for refund suit, applied, rather than the broad general tucker act statute of limitations. and this court held that the specific controlled over the general because congress was entitled to provide more specifically in a particular situation when the need called for it.
we did not ascribe motives to them. they  they drew it to demonstrate that  that you could draw a district with a bare majority of citizen voting population, although their experts also testified that a bare majority will not elect in this region because of lower voter  voter turnout.
that doesn't seem to me to make a lot of sense.
okay. so if we read the medicaid statute to require something less than what your position is here, then you lose.
and i take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.
in a later order, yes.
well, tell me about now, not at the common law.
so then it really makes no difference whether it was gillette who had the dog in his car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who had the dog.
our argument would be the same, but for an additional reason there, and that is that even where congress has  or even where a substance may be distributed and used, it is only for medical purposes, which is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the health and safety purposes of the statute. and even then, it is done to very strict  pursuant to very strict controls that are really incompatible with sacramental use of a substance. there is a requirement of prescription, or dispensing by a physician under physician control, with recordkeeping  identifying the dosage, the amount of the sacrament  recordkeeping of the person who takes it. there is  there is an incompatibility and potential entanglement problem in how to  in trying to apply a system like that, even under schedule 2. but under schedule 1, what you have is contraband, as this court said 
you've got the case that helps you if that occurs. why do you need to argue for something else?
thank you.
but  but are you? i'm  i'm a little concerned that  that you're trying to persuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the expense of watering down 703. i don't understand how you can concede that  that refusing to invite somebody to lunch, if it's more than  more than a single lunch, could be a violation of 703. how does that come within the  with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment?
and so, i was saying earlier that a critical component of integra's case revolves around the notion that the use may not have more than one purpose, and that purpose can only be fda directed. that argument is also incorrect as a matter of law. and one way we can tell that is that there is no such thing as a preclinical course of study that has only one purpose. when one is studying mechanism of action, a scientist is deeply interested, not just in how this drug works, but in how the disease works. and the language of the statute is, of course, the touchstone here. the statute is triggered by uses. the use, in this context, is an experiment. and the statute covers, provides a safe harbor for, experiments that develop the sorts of information that are relevant to the fda. if that 
but i don't know the answer to your question. i  i don't know that. but an  we  the internal revenue code respects people who enter into corporations, who enter into joint ventures, who enter into sole proprietorships, who hire employees or allow themselves to be hired by others. those relationships are all respected and honored by the internal revenue code, and the commissioner is asking you to dishonor this relationship because mr. banaitis could have handled the case himself or could 
and the tribes had already entered into contracts. now, how was that lump sum used?
and this is a statute designed to give people recovery 
the same water that went into the dam 
it seems to me they were on notice that, although it did not, necessarily, it might. i think you're 
yes.
mr. miller, do 
yes, your honor. and if i 
it's never been there.
no, but the  the attorney general said that the  the fact that in this particular case the issue was focused on, in effect, sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent upon the assumption about what federal law required. it was dependent upon the earlier case which so held. so i don't  and  and what he seem  says seems plausible to me. i  i don't see how we can divorce the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which kansas  which the kansas supreme court relied upon here, which was a federal ground.
 technically, but 
they were required to be there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go out there, but they were under school supervision at that time.
it, it may, your honor. and, and because that provision predated this court's booker decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.
your 
well, in this  yes, but on your theory, that is  that is incidental. that is not essential. if he had had an arrest warrant for illegal taping, you'd be making the same argument.
mr. korrell 
i think, as in other situations where this court does not apply the exclusionary rule, simply on a deterrence basis  because the court does not always apply the exclusionary rule, even when there would be deterrence  that that is correct.
no, i understand.
 you can go back to state court. i mean, that's even worse. he gets it right.
your honor, we chose not to 
getting upset is a constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit? if people get upset about spending money for purposes that the federal government is not allowed to spend money for because of states' rights, that also would justify article iii standing, wouldn't it?
 it's disturbing to think that some court below deliberately was trying to defy what this court said. and i'm not sure there is any indication of that. it may have thought that those issues  those other acts were overlooked, and, therefore, they had some right to deal with it. but i wonder if we shouldn't focus on the other two legal issues here.
may i ask you the same question i asked your  your colleague? supposing we're not in massachusetts, but we're in another state that provided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the judge's ruling in this case. would  would you have the same appraisal of the case on those facts?
well, didn't he seek a coa?
can you make the argument that  maybe you can't  that the special trial judge can go to the tax court judge, with the permission of the chief judge, and say, now, here's what  kind of what i'm thinking? it's not my report, but here's what i'm thinking. and then the  the tax court judge says, well, why don't you have some more findings on x and y and z? he says, okay, and then he goes back. can you make the argument that that first document is not the report?
but if we're talking just about vmi, not about the other schools, then you  if this claim is unrelated, so that it would be a permissive counterclaim, then you would say not even against vmi could you have the setoff.
under your rule that filing is sufficient, are there any instances of  of frivolous petition where your rule would not apply?
thank you, ms. maynard. the case is submitted.
the federal controlled substances act does not occupy the field of drug control in the country, any more than any other federal crime occupies that field. and 
 and then seek cert up here. right?
thank you, general. the case is submitted.
maryland 
justice scalia, i think it's appropriate. both parties cite the vast waste of judicial resources that would occur if forum non conveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first. and frankly, we see that as the other way. the insight case in our opinion 
yes, he was.
but you do 
and certainly they would have 12 phrased the statute one way or the other more clearly. 13 they could have done that.
principal part, but 
well, various lower courts have considered that possibility and have latched onto the different  differences in language where paragraph 8(2) explicitly states it has to be made by the supreme court, but paragraph 6(3) says it does not. and  and the court below said the same thing, and the parties agree that the retroactivity decision need not be made by this court.
but  but they took the position of actually urging, making a recommendation. i  i don't think there would be a due process violation if they said, we don't know. they didn't take that. they  they urged a position, and i think that's the key factor when the  in this case.
are the courts in washington state elected, do we know that? are they elected?
i guess you're right. i think i was thinking of free exercise cases rather than establishment cases.
it was not amended because it was not  it was relevant and fact-specific in the display itself.
which cuts against what you're saying.
right. that  that's always 
 what's going on.
but in 1899, it just said navigable rivers, not  not every  every tributary defined to include even storm drains.
well, mr. collins, isn't it your position that, number one, the only judgment that he can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92 judgment that follows the resentencing? but he may in attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction which occurred earlier?
i disagree, because i think then it does reduce the words "physical violence or threats of physical violence" to mere surplusage.
but  but, your honor, the chinese example was not cited by this court. it was in the record. and it may be a  a genuine issue ad.
 under e(3), but 
but that 
well, we've said it a lot, though, haven't we? why do we keep on saying it?
actually, justice scalia, i believe when the call begins, the caller is speaking in the present tense and says, he's here jumping on me again. and the 911 operator then begins to elicit information to find out what is the level of the threat to her safety and what actions need to be taken and says, okay, i've got help started. help is on the way. now, tell me what his name is, and she  the  the caller tells what the name is of the defendant and, at that point, says, he's running now. and so, it's only after critical information is imparted at the beginning of the call that the caller says that he's leaving. but even 
yes.
your honor, i don't believe that 106(b) or 106(c) limits the waiver in this case, because, again, the sovereign immunity that was waived was the sovereign immunity of the commonwealth of virginia. and so, the claims that were asserted in that action, the preference actions that are served against vmi and the other institutions, are preserved, because we can 
as to the element, i thought that what the ninth circuit talked about was overt act. they didn't use the words "overt act."
well, you said  i think you were saying  this is something for congress to solve; it's not for the court. but the court is now faced with two apparently conflicting decisions: aimster, in the seventh circuit, the ninth circuit decision. and if you're just looking at this in the abstract, you might say, "well, it's  isn't it odd that napster goes one way in the ninth circuit, and this case goes another way?"
it says that in the blue brief? official
where the inconsistent  i.e., it would be nondiverse, but you said there couldn't be such a situation.
may i ask 
well, they weren't sponsoring the olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event actually. they simply let the students out to watch it. that was 
 and that all of them shall be  even if the juror himself does not believe, morally, that this particular aggravator ought to be there. so, it's not as though our law says that somehow the jury has to  each juror has to be able to make, like solomon, his own moral judgment on this fellow. and one of the things that the  that the kansas law prescribes is that when they're in equipoise, the people of kansas think that the aggravators that they have specified are serious enough that unless there is something to overcome them, the death penalty is appropriate. that seems to me a moral judgment within the limited range of moral judgment that the jury is accorded.
section (a)(3), your honor. i'll refer you, if i may, to the brief of amicus at page 11, and that's why i mentioned, your honor, that there is a new numbering because the numbering in the amicus brief is using the 2005 numbering in the revised statute. and what is listed there as (a)(4) is the wages priority, and at the next page, (a)(5) is the priority that we're talking about as  as (a)(4).
well, how about the one you're 25 offering? before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why 1 yours does not suffer the  the  at least i think, the 2 objection that i've  i've raised?
 is our conception.
isn't the compelling interest in enforcing it against the aggrieved person. isn't that what you mean?
but it was your preferred forum, not theirs. when they filed their complaint, they filed it in new jersey where they had a related case pending. so you chose the forum.
yes. now, the  the jury in the wesley trial rejected that position.
no, but the 
well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.
well, mr. chief justice, first of all, when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement it does trouble me. they weren't giving him anything for this easement which they had already extracted from his predecessor.
well, it doesn't entirely come down. it just  half of it comes down.
there's not a presumption that the person is a member of the gang. but there is a presumption 
and you think that that should be admissible in a criminal trial?
but it's a group decision, and jurors are encouraged and forced to compromise to come to a verdict. and in close cases, with jurors leaning slightly one way or another, they, being forced to come to a consensus, are even more likely to compromise on equipoise, rather than engage in the draining task of persuading each person leaning one way or the other to come together.
that seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? is this an  is this an unreasonable application of chapman? and then apply the brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of chapman?
i think 
well, i  i take it justice ginsburg's point  and it's my concern as well  is that if the bivens action is brought first, there's no protection of the government against multiple actions. so  so the policy that you're arguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to be brought first.
what about  what about the dna  the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of white? there  there was no trace of white's dna. and that was a fbi officer who testified to that.
 that congress meant to put that to one side.
by the way, a penny and you have to buy marvelous component. and by the way, if it takes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and if not, not.
i  i plan on continuing to use it.
justice breyer, i  i think it's helpful to make a conceptual distinction between the claim, the underlying litigation claim, and the right to receive the funds. now, certainly mr. banks in this case had a right to enter into settlement or not. he had a right to fire his attorney. but once he assigned the contingent fee portion of the recovery, he, as a practical matter, had no ability, he had no control over that portion of the recovery. another fundamental difference between 
can a county be an arm of the state for some things?
but you're the one that's asking us to adopt a rule. and i'm suggesting to you that there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule that you request, and that is the government's interest in regularity and consistency of its speech. they don't have to claim it on a case-by-case basis. you're the ones that are asking us to make this rule.
that's correct.
and i'd like to know your answer and you just said to scalia what i thought  justice scalia that i thought what was an answer isn't because i thought that word practical, as co-counsel recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get rid of a lot of these. now you're saying no, it doesn't.
no, but just looking at this case itself, if there is plenty of money there to pay a state law obligation, why shouldn't just ordinary rules of contract law apply?
but 
i agree that those facts are relevant, but it's the operative facts that are 
well, but what  what about the basic question, that as a matter of trial strategy, it is a recognized, acceptable, sometimes prudent, sometimes wise strategy to concentrate on a sentencing phase?
all right. let me, let me follow, actually ask you the same question on  on that. because in response to justice scalia's question you said certainly that the school has got the right to have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling for violations of the law. accepting that as a premise, don't we need, before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with that policy? and if that is so, is bong hits 4 jesus inconsistent with it? it sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me.
well, your honor, actually their discovery rights are less than what they would normally have. but let me go to the idea, then, that we are 
but 
if your  if your arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be the case? in which case, why do you need a presumption at all?
no, i 
i know, but if they said so 
well, then they can wait a long time. (laughter.)
very well, mr. casey. mr. moran, we'll hear from you.
i think undermining in the sense of preventing impeding the school from delivering its own message 
but that is not your loss. you're saying now the loss has to occur later when the price goes down and you're thereby harmed. is that it?
and do you disagree with that?
and 
well, what is your burden to prove? you've talked about their burden to go back when  do i understand it that your view is that the only thing you have to prove is that in this case a woman was being paid at a rate which is different from the rate of a man doing a comparable job?
i told you, you have to locate  you'd have to locate in the low-tax state to get advantage of the low  of the low tax.
i don't know the answer to the question except to state that those two, those convictions did happen in the years that you state and he did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998. i believe it was through a waiver provision under the ina that that's how he became a lawful permanent resident.
your honor, i think that this court can decide this question based on what the face of the statute is  itself says.
is it relevant, general clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union? it seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the election process, because they left the same old hudson in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have to do with elections.
and that's because of the nature of this conduct. this is not conduct that was directed at jesse williams and he was the sole recipient of what philip morris did here. this was a massive market directed fraud driven by their rational and deliberate decisions at the highest levels of the company to deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health. they knew that this would have a special impact on those who are highly addicted, as jesse williams was. and so this is the misconduct that oregon is seeking to deter. and how is a state, given the considerable flexibility that this court has recognized, going to deter that kind of misconduct if instead society's interest has to be official fractionalized on an individual case-by-case basis knowing that the majority of those cases will never take place and in fact in oregon will not?
 as an entrepreneur.
no. i can't find any quantitative assessment.
including but not limited to. this was a school authorized event, this was education outside of the classroom. it was essentially a school simply out of doors. it was essentially 
your honor, there is almost no legislative history for the 1948 revision. all there is, as you rightly say, is the reviser's notes. but this court has said that the reviser's notes are not authoritative. and this court has said, on so many occasions, that 
 why should that make a difference as to whether it's retroactive or not? i mean, if it  it seems to me you look to the activity that it governs. and the activity that it governs is the deportation or removal from now on. now, you could argue that  if you want, that there are some due process violations in making that prospective law affect past activities as they do. i mean, let's  one of the examples given in landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in landgraf, was a change of the law procedure so that expert testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now admissible. now, the person who committed the crime that's involved in the next case that comes up when that new procedural rule is applied, he can say, "well, you know, you've changed  you've changed the rules on me. when i committed the crime, the expert testimony wasn't admissible. now it is admissible. that's not fair." well, whether it's fair or not is something we can inquire into under the due process clause, but nobody would say that that procedural change is retroactive. and it 
certainly.
 the meaning of the  of the case?
what do you say  i'm sorry.
 you're making 
well, then i think i would  i mean, i  i'm not sure i can point to a decision by the attorney general, but i think it's  in the structure of this act  obviously the schedule 1 treatment of marijuana that this court had before it in the raich case, involved a situation where the act clearly displaced the medical judgments of california and nine other states 
that was the position of the district court, although i don't think the petitioner is now advocating that view. and that view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create the anomaly that the attorney general's authority to certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of the employee would be narrower than the employee's own authority to assert the immunity, because again going back to the willingham case, the court never asked whether it would be within the scope of employment for the prison officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner; rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but anything that happened between us and the prisoner happened within the scope of our employment. and so the official attorney general's authority to certify has to be at least as broad as that in our view.
yes, and i can imagine, in "non-weighing" state, a prosecutor banging on and on, at the eligibility stage, on factor x, and really fixing that in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor x is not an aggravator. now, the jury might have been prejudiced. and i can imagine, in a "weighing" state that, because the evidence is the same, and because there were so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the wrong factor didn't really make any difference. so, it seems to me the lineup between harm  real harm in a case, and weighing/non-weighing, it doesn't line up terribly well. but you have the experience. and that's why i'd like your reaction.
it's not on the face.
it would have been constitutional, to the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to give some use whatsoever to belmontes' proffered evidence in mitigation, and that's what this court's prior cases has  and, particularly, the various texas cases have said that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of the evidence. in california 
your honor, we  we  it would be mere speculation to  for  for this court or any court to  to conclude why this evidence was not presented to the district court. there are any number of reasons.
that  that's what i find interesting. it might be, if you're representing the interests of defendants here, you'd love this to have the procedural default rule, because it will end up with the federal judges all over the country systematically reviewing the exhaustion procedures  or the  yes, the remedies in the prisons. and where those remedies are not right or unfair or too short or have other problems with them, the judges will say, "you can't have this kind of remedy. if you want me to apply exhaustion principles, you can't do it."
there's  there's a very careful use of language. it says all reports of the tax court and all evidence received by the tax court and its divisions. so it's only the evidence that  that's received by the individual judges has to be made public, not the reports.
that's not your theory. i mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you have a case that you can bring, isn't it?
you just are looking at the harms that his being there in that room without announcing might bring about. that doesn't mean that's why we don't have the rule. we have the rule to keep him out of there without announcing.
but it still shows  whatever power they were  they were proceeding under, it still shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able to use a substance banned by category 1. i mean 
that's not my understanding 
in this very case, you're saying the court would  would rule on the state's proposed alternative. right?
i don't 
mr. kaplan, you said two things and i  i'm wondering whether these are separate or they're really one concept. i thought your answer was going to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the casino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in navigation. it may satisfy the 1 u.s.c. definition of vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by the jones act. so i thought that's what you would  something that's taken out of navigation would not qualify.
no.
yes, but the state's position was that the jailhouse informant had told the truth, wasn't it?
and that's exactly right. these districts were drawn to protect incumbents. it is notable that if one looks on a national level, the 2001 map drawn by the court led to the most anti-majoritarian results of any of the 50 states in the union. there were only two other states with more than five members of congress that saw a minority of voters electing a majority of the delegation, and those were illinois and tennessee. in each of those, 49 percent in illinois elected one extra seat to congress; in tennessee, 48 percent. in texas, by contrast, 45 percent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the overall state vote elected not just a one-seat majority, but a two-seat majority. and so on any national level, the prior map was the most profoundly anti-majoritarian. now, this court resolved in  in vieth that majoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but that being said, as mr. smith characterized in vieth, he characterized the fundamental principle of democracy  and this is mr. smith's characterization  is the principle that a majority can elect a majority of the delegation. and as this court concluded in gaffney v. cummings, achieving political fairness, achieving a rough sense of proportionality, such that a majority can elect a majority of the delegation, is not only legitimate, it is salutary. it is 
mr. andre, you have five minute remaining.
the whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the government. i mean, if he makes an allegation that this design is not going to work, the pondcrete is not going to work, and the government, prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out that because of human error they're not making it the right way, even if the design does work, he get no credit for that?
maybe on the year by year, don't spend any money on, maybe congress decided that wasn't an appropriate technique, but congress has used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?
we don't think it's a difference, your honor, because we think the underlying fact, the adequacy of the trial objection, was what obtained. and i'd like to point out 
it would, but if they chose not to equalize at all because they don't want to spend the money the money that would be a nondiscriminatory reason.
 why they did 
and then what is the standard you use, the definition to use to get to that result? is this your practically point again?
no, okay. if it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the court of claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?
why don't you incorporate what the solicitor general has suggested, that is, you draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are calling for  for immediate help?
they did it. (laughter.)
principal place of business.
well 
he may not have any right to it, but in fact, he may get some relief.
the view of the commission  it's one i share, but a particular court might not  is that that is not a good  a reasonable work place judgment. one could disagree with it. but the  those employees will be very valuable. and it's not that they will retire, i should make clear. it's that they're eligible to retire. it  it may well be a different case if you could say, i asked the person. they said they're leaving in a year. the rule challenged there was mere eligibility to retire, and they did give the other examples. i didn't finish with the court cases. they are klein, which is 807 f.supp. 1517, which is a hiring test i think by the faa in that case that  that happened to exclude all of the people, i think, over the age of 55. and there are other cases that are, in the line of cases that i was discussing with justice breyer, in which the employer doesn't say  doesn't give the person who gets the higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being fired. so the statute, both in the non-cost context and the cost context, has very important applications. i did want to return to your correct premise, however, justice ginsburg. you said there aren't many cases. i think it's important to recognize that the  the important, legitimate cases, by and large, are conciliated by the eeoc. remember, it goes through an administrative process first. the eeoc found a violation here, gave us a right to sue letter. the  the city just declined to settle with us. there have been  and i have checked. there have been 74 disparate impact cases in the history of the statute that are reported in the federal courts, and i think that is a good answer to the idea of the respondents that this will impose a huge burden on employers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of litigation. remember 
i'm not sure how to ask the question: is it used fairly evenly across the board when it is the tiebreaker?
that's exactly right.
yes. yes. crawford doesn't tell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of cross-examination is a new right as gideon tells us. instead crawford tells us 
i believe it is not the better course for three reasons. one is we can't tell what exception the new hampshire legislature would have chosen. in addition, i think there is real cause for concern about rewriting this law for new hampshire. if this court says that that's the proper course, i believe that the federal judiciary will be faced with rewriting abortion law after abortion law after abortion law.
but  but isn't there also evidence that the spillage in the styrofoam container seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood that was missing from the vial?
well, in  in batson, i guess the opinion for the court suggested that it was basing it on the title vii cases, the mcdonnell douglas formula. is that right or not? or have we gone beyond that?
and the problem that i have with your position is, i don't know of anything in the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to defend, that he wouldn't have  or it wasn't ready to defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment, that you could have  could not have gotten, from the party you named, all the relief that you were asking for.
i think that if that was done, then we are moving in the right direction. but  [laughter.]
even without going back to the state court, i don't see anything in this statute which indicates that congress expected everybody who comes into federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to remedy that defect by running back to state court and  and filing. this statute doesn't give any such indication. and it's clear that will never happen if he files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the state proceedings. right? i mean, his year is up already. even if the judge decides the question the next morning, it's too late. so i  i don't know why we have to be concerned about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to  to state court. i don't see anything in the statute that  that guarantees or that even envisions that. and i  i 
but that's ambiguous. that's perfectly ambiguous. because, the case of your client, it is a felony, and it is punishable under the controlled substances act.
you're saying, i think contrary to your colleague if i remember correctly, that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent differential policy established 20 years ago, it could still carry it into effect today.
i don't believe that. (laughter.)
exactly. that the 
it's not sub-legal rules. what it's called is precedent. what you do is you decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you decide it the same way. and if a district judge doesn't follow that, you reverse it.
i understand, but i didn't ask you what you said in your brief.
well, that may be one reason why we have federal habeas proceedings.
the  the 
those  those are all, are they not, cases involving the  the guilt phase of  of a trial? right?
which it seems to me quite significant.
 once it's on the 
thank you, ms.  ms. bunn. mr. waxman, you have about 3 minutes left.
well, i think the problem that justice souter identified, i believe, where an employer or even a collective bargaining agreement could identify categories that had so many different responsibilities 
well, that's because the  the formula is that the issue has to either have been raised or decided.
 they pick up some friends of his who are engaged in drugs, the government might decide to try to get him back.
i think 
thank you, mr. waxman. ms. brinkmann?
i 
i've  i've got it. okay.
this court in procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and  and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. and presumably 
but at the outset, you made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement that we need not decide about global warming in this case. but don't we have to do that in order to decide the standing argument, because there's no injury if there's not global warming? or, can you show standing simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived would show that there's an injury?
well, what  what are the psychological reasons?
right.
you think that's socially acceptable?
because there's a statute that allows 
right.
i do not, your honor. i  i know with federal agents, federal agents say nothing. they're required to say nothing. they simply bring a defendant in on a warrantless arrest, cuff him, leave him in the cellblock, and then the assistant u.s. attorneys take the matter before a magistrate. so there is  and that's one of the things that demonstrates the unworkability of this test because there are plenty of jurisdictions, thousands of federal agents, who are under no obligation to say anything. and so it's hard to see how this test, even to the extent there were a concern about the evil or perceived evil of post hoc rationalization, which i suggest there isn't, this  how this test would be applied 
he's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants. that's the whole purpose of it. and the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the  you know  consistent with selling as many products as he can.
yes, your honor, because, first of all, you said, in rodriguez, the constitution does not guarantee that a search, only with the defendant's consent, will occur. your honors said that 
and when it got back in the state supreme court, they would still be working on the application that had been pending until the end of the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back to life after we sent it back.
no, not collateral estoppel, but you know, i'd be repeating myself. official
very well, mr. eastman. mr. elwood, we'll hear from you.
well 
can i make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either state farm, bmw, any of our punitive damages precedents?
i'd like to hear what they are.
the  the  there could be  there could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling, justice breyer, but  but 
no. i  i realize that. but at  at the end of the day, you want your money, and  and i don't see why you can't get your money simply by going back into the state court. maybe  maybe lapse of time bars you at this point. but presumably you could have avoided all of this by simply saying, we didn't agree to the settlement. we're still here. we want our  the  the remainder of our money.
well, i think they can have the plant. they just  assuming that is 
oh, not necessarily. it wouldn't be always either way. i would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.
and they also have unintended consequences when this court ignores them.
but is their whole question of the coa waivable?
 analysis, would you use, as one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague? would that be a component of your harmless-error analysis?
but may i ask this question? i think you have conceded, in a footnote  and maybe you're  almost conceded  that if this were a rico case, a civil rico case, that the congress enacted the rico statute against this background rule and that perhaps the rico case could not go forward. what if it were a federal rico case and  the same facts  would the rico statute be qualified by the revenue rule?
he has conceded that if the  if it is found by the court that the statement given was a 
in 1984 actually, there was a proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted burglary would qualify. that was passed by the senate, never passed by the house, never enacted. so later on when burglary was actually defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary that taylor came close to defining the same way.
well, if 
yeah.
no, but i 
 you don't even have, in matlock, a situation where you know that one of the parties didn't want entry. you don't know that. you  there was one party there, and that party said, "okay, come in." and the other party said, "well, if i had been consulted, i would have said no," or whatever. but 
but in  in prison's unique environment, your honor, where there are so many deprivations of liberty and then to say the one  one way you can get out from under the thumb of all these prison regulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give you a powerful weapon not again to 
but justice souter, that's impractical and unethical in this case because if mr. fitzgerald and mr. vogler were to do that, they would have to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea and sentencing issues 
i think congress would say the perils and problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any method of determining which count and which don't count of foreign convictions are too great. now 
but it would have been the easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you think that this is not true that enzyme gl706bx, contrary to what dr. blake said, had not deteriorated in the blood spot, do a test. find out if it's deteriorated or not. can't  can't that be done? i mean, dr. blake in this part is reading his own report. his own report says the enzyme deteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and i see nothing here that says to the contrary. but if that weren't true, the blood is right there, and if it weren't true that it had deteriorated, i would have expected testimony, at the least, saying no, dr. blake, you are wrong.
except  except where there's a public policy against what you want to estop him into doing. i mean, it seems to me for the same reason that you don't allow a waiver, you shouldn't allow an estoppel. there's a public policy against it. the  the congress wanted these things tried promptly, and  and whether he merely waives or  or goes further and affirmatively causes the court to do something which it shouldn't have done, you're just as much violating the policy it seems to me.
and  and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.
then there will never be a suppression of  of evidence specified in a warrant when the warrant's no-knock component is violated 
i think i know why. because it affects the atmospherics of the trial.
but  but 
do you think  do you think that the president can enter into a treaty, with the approval of congress, that would provide that, in a particular combat, the commander in chief will be somebody other than the president of the united states?
in 
well, justice scalia, the ten commandments send both a religious message and a secular message. when people 
another  well, your honor, i'll offer another distinction then. the other distinction is prosecutorial immunity and qualified immunity, for that matter, are court-created entities 
well, but what we're trying to determine is, what do you consider in determining whether he has  a reasonable person initiating 
after they selected the new foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the crucial evidence in the case. the ballistics experts. they asked for that. they asked for the testimony of the in-custody witness who heard the confession of mr. fry. they asked for mr. fry's testimony.
may i ask you one quick question, but you can comment on it  the statute expressly says, "they shall impose a sentence of death if the trier of fact concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances." how do you respond to that? why is it not a "weighing" state when it says that?
no. they are  they are complaining about the 
they're not incorporated  they're not incorporated under the laws of any state, though.
yes.
well, the sentencing commission when they were interpreting the career offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a official guideline that is worded different than the 
well, right now 
but it seems to be saying, because the cable companies do not offer separate telecommunications service, they don't have to offer it.
in other words 
if the act is either a state felony or a federal felony, you lose. i mean, the defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?
about the objective? i mean, think we should foster separateness? is there anything wrong 
he can, you are correct. it is at the option of the attorney general under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that the review of his noncertification happens in federal court. (d)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides that if the district court holds that the attorney general was correct that the employee was not acting within the scope the case is to be remanded to state court. so the presence of the remand  official
thank you, mr. nager. i think you've answered the question. mr. goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's make it 4 and a half.
 surely rfra doesn't say that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in determining what's a compelling interest.
well, what 
all right. so, the  in the supreme court.
mr. chief justice, that wouldn't be practical, and that raises a point that justice souter also raised in the argument. it wouldn't be practical for mr. fitzgerald or mr. vogler to offer their services pro bono to some indigent in this position because to do so would probably  probably be unethical or malpractice. first of all, they can't be appointed. what the statute prohibits is the appointment of counsel like mr. fitzgerald and mr. vogler. so they  they cannot form an attorney-client relationship by operation of law.
but it could be revealed by a title search?
mr. blanchard, if i could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, i didn't understand your position to be that the occ can come in and regulate this non-federal bank up to the point where its  well, can do it apparently without limitation. and where its regulation conflicts with the state regulation, the federal prevails.
no, your honor. two points here. first, it says "a plan." it's clear, there is  it's a plan to obstruct, interfere, or affect commerce. the others, your honor, you quickly skipped over 
oh, that's correct, justice ginsburg. the literal language is not specifically what i was saying. what i'm talking about is the secretary's attempt to resolve what is an apparent inconsistency between the literal language in 552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).
 that's the point  [laughter.]
for  no, i don't think it's irrelevant to the workplace. i think it is irrelevant to the proper disposition of this case, yes.
it  section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all  all it does by its text  and its structure makes clear all it does  is to govern the internal processes of official ocr investigations. it does not go further than that. this court in sandoval was very clear that it was  that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. another point i want to make about the administrative remedy. justice ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as senator bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. that, obviously, was a valid concern in cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. but as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief  and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the southern poverty law center that spins this out in some detail  there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the  either  either in the judicial system or at ocr.
though not necessarily as far as storm drains. it would be enough to  to say navigable  you know, non-navigable tributaries that are real  real tributaries.
yes.
well 
right. but, your honor, this case 
when you say going forward, i thought we were talking about damages for the past violation, not damages for future violations which will continue. are we talking about that too?
in this case 
well, then why doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of the court to raise it sua sponte?
 clause legislation.
so, what's 
no, sir. the 
well, the board actually at every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it was necessary to continue the use of race, whether to narrow it, and eventually to end it. and i think it is in the joint appendix at 408, the superintendent's testimony of the, simultaneously the measures that the board was implementing in terms of resource allocation, implementation of new programs, because they realized that by diversifying choice, they could hopefully achieve some of these same ends, not as quickly, not as efficiently, but that they could achieve them. that's been indeed the entire trajectory of seattle's integration efforts since the first seattle plan.
well, that probably will be what will be alleged. of course, you don't know when  at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we rule in your favor, what alternative the state is going to provide, and i am willing to bet whatever that alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge under a new 1983 suit. there would be no claim preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was at this point. right?
but you 
no, your honor. that's not my understanding of the practice. the encouragement of congress setting up the independent judiciary and government of guam has also included fiscal responsibility, and part of that are the bond issuance and the issues that are here before the court.
the most reasonable explanation for that, justice souter, i would suggest is at the time of smith iii the court had not decided hood, which means it had not concluded that penry ii was also so novel that it would forgive failure to raise it.
yes. if we alleged harm from the court and sought relief from the court's judgment.
i thought your position was it shouldn't be read at all because 
due process clause because?
but isn't 
well, my question is, is it implied in what you're argued that it would be equally unconstitutional, in the same way, to tell the cigarette industry to advertise, "don't smoke," or to tell the automobile industry to advertise, "buy car seats for your children," or to tell the crib industry to advertise, "be sure you have an anti-crib-death device"?
well, taylor and shepard both talk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) should be looked at in a  using a categorical approach, and official the court has talked about that being an approach looking to the elements of the offense.
 the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.
well even if the court didn't think that this is a completely satisfactory analytical line to draw, as i said before there are good practical reasons for drawing it, and every reason to think that congress did draw it, because congress enacted this statute against the background legal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the employment relationship arise out of recurring transactions and give rise to recurring causes of action. and that's the rule that everybody acknowledges congress adopted under the equal pay act. and to hold that there is a different rule under title vii would for example lead to the anomalous proposition that congress intended to permit women, a white woman in 1967 to challenge the present disparity in her pay, but not a black man under title vii because the discrimination there was racial. we don't think that congress intended the two acts to perform in such dramatically different ways. in fact 
 that would be an intentional 
your honor, we read that as allowing removal in those circumstances when the united states is joined later. in any event, i have to say that with regard to  to this disagreement, it does  it's not dispositive or even affect the case here. the fact is that this waiver of sovereign immunity under no circumstances would allow this suit to go forward. apart from the money damages aspect, which itself is  is  would preclude this type of suit, these parties are not intended beneficiaries, and without being intended beneficiaries, there's  in no circumstances could they ever evoke these provisions.
and they do like to keep their party members as happy as they can.
but i don't think we should write  write our patent law because we have some renegade jurisdictions. why  why isn't the  the free market normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking about? everybody is in this for the money. nobody is going to hold off giving the license beyond the point where  where it makes financial sense.
that's true.
that's correct, your honor. rather than characterizing those as "removal-friendly," i would characterize them as "resource-friendly." i think all of this can be  can be understood as a congressional effort, overall, to reduce the amount of resources that are put into jurisdictional issues. and the rule we're proposing would further that goal; that is, by somewhat deterring the, by definition, incorrect removal. now, on  every incorrect removal not only harms the plaintiff  harms the plaintiff a good bit  the delay, the expense  and there's been some concern i've heard voiced about the great expense that this might impose on defendants  it imposes a great expense on defendants only precisely in as much as the defendant has imposed a great expense on the plaintiff by its incorrect action. now, it is true that fees 
two points?
well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts how to deal with secured claims.
even though he knows that it carries forward the illegal discrimination?
 i have 
you could say the same about a tax. you could say, you know, you only have to pay this tax if you operate in michigan. you don't want to operate; you don't have to pay it. and you could also say unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in michigan. does that make it a tax or a fee?
mr. hungar, one of the amicus briefs for the respondent was submitted by a professor, i think, named barry nalebuff 
what is the answer? i mean, you've read the briefs. the obvious reply to that is there are many, many districts in the united states where african american voters have a big influence on the democratic primary.
the  as i remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?
yes.
okay.
what 
 license.
but do you have compensated activities that do not begin the workday?
 on the low side, it's good. if it just extracts profits on the high side, it's bad.
your honor, i think there is a very different message that's conveyed.
wasn't that 2 months?
yes.
but it's also limited to vessels. it's smuggling by water, not smuggling by 
but what about enforcement actions taken by the 
are you suggesting there was no consideration of overall educational benefits in this plan?
yes, your honor.
but i thought your submission earlier was that we don't have any record evidence about how often the complications arise, so it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference is in terms of safety under your submission.
what do you do with the policy argument  at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather than the trees  that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer competition in interbrand  in the interbrand market, rather than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed to protect the intrabrand position?
justice ginsburg, one of the interesting things about the record in this case is that the state of california has been unable to identify a single incident of a  of interracial violence between cellmates. the record is bereft of that kind of information. rather, they've spoken of information about violence which occurs in more 
 of violence and threats of violence.
 it to justice stevens.
i 
right.
thank you, ms. williams. mr. shanmugam.
 of the 
can you tell me? it's my  excuse me. my understanding was that arkansas had intervened in the suit.
if the instructions said, you know, you've got to find all of the things that are set out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict, then we would have found  and that would satisfy the requirement of an additional fact on an element.
well, if it is, it's probably only at a  at a marginal number. my guess is 
there it says  there it says includes. and if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.
under the statute  justice ginsburg, under the statute, the office of personnel management is charged with selecting the benefits and exclusions for this particular program and for this particular plan. the statutory section is 8902(d). and those terms are  opm has the final authority over those terms and those terms are placed in a statement of benefits which the  which this statute also says shall become part of the contract and are attached and incorporated into the contract. so the final authority over the benefits and the exclusions 
if 
the right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension 
yes, i agree with that.
so you think that 
provided equitable 
well, we don't necessarily agree, your honor, if  we don't necessarily agree that 
but i think that there's the further indication that it is not going to be deemed reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact, as indicated in order to support one of the specific guideline aggravators.
yes. in our  in our brief we have challenged that. the  the requirement is that there be an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact.
no, your honor. what this court did was reverse and remand for further consideration, consistent with the decision of this court. since this court had not considered the 
well, could  could an arrest made under the circumstances i described be valid?
you do agree. all right. now, 8 if you 
so the difference between the constitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.
and the states that have 
justice souter, there's two answers to that. the first is that this won't be  it will be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations because the next argument is going to be procedural default, and the next argument is going to be misapplication of teague's non-retroactivity principle, and the next one is going to be mistake in applying adequate, independent state grounds. the  a bulk  a huge percentage of federal court decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules because federal habeas is not a roving commission for error correction. you have to  at  in the same breath that you establish a constitutional violation, you have to show it's proper for federal courts to act. procedural default and statute of limitations are as much your job to show to have federal relief as it is to show that something went wrong under the constitution. it's a  there's a dual character to federal habeas relief. so this, in fact, is exactly part of the habeas  this is part of the second or successive determinations that  applications that congress wanted to bar. and we have to step back and think about what would happen here. what we have is the state of florida coming up 23 years after a guilty plea not because to defend  once again, it's judgment. it's conviction not because of anything they did in the conduct of the trial, not because the guy claims to be actually innocent, but because almost 2 decades after the plea, a federal court allegedly made a mistake of law that wasn't cleared up through the appellate process. that's not the point of federal habeas corpus. that's not what it's supposed to be about. but if we open the door, if we let the camel's nose in the tent, a camel is going to come behind it, and it's going to be procedural default, non-retroactivity of teague, and all of the multiple other grounds on which federal habeas decisions are made by courts.
absolutely.
well, nor  nor on fund raising using up your time because all a wealthy person has to do is write a check. and  and, of course, in vermont, they even have an exception for not only just the wealthy  wealthy candidate, but the wealthy family. so, you know 
all right. but just  i just want to nail this 
but it wasn't raised in the fifth circuit by texas, was it?
well, the  the troublesome thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you said in south dakota, go back to the state court a second time, because they had a swift district judge, and some won't because the district judge was slow. so to treat identically situated petitioners differently not because of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and the other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator, that seems arbitrary and not anything that congress built into the statute.
thank you, mr. schalit. the case is submitted.
you also said that you thought this case is distinguishable on the legitimacy of taping the conversation with the police officer on the highway. why  why do you think this is distinguishable from the washington intermediate appellate court decision that the  that the  that alford wanted to show to the police officer?
so they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.
ms. blatt.
well, based on our review of the record  and we haven't been able to see the entire record  i agree with you, the petitioners ought to be able to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and that's a narrow way to decide the case. i do think, though, this court might have to say something about the sony issue before it reached that issue. and if it did feel compelled to do that, i think it would be a mistake to sanction the ninth circuit's reading of sony, because, you're right, there's a theoretical possibility that public-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but it's also true that this system doesn't have much of a comparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.
there's an exemption for losses like  one of the court's questions with respect to a casualty loss or something that  but it's limited. the liability, nonetheless, exists on the distributor.
but, your honor, there are already a host of circumstances in which litigants would like to be able to get out of contracts that do not involve arbitration clauses, where they would like to be able to argue that no contract came into existence in the first place. and the public policy typically  and in florida particularly  tends to be linked to statutes. in most states, there is a rule that says of contract law, that we will not void a contract because some judge feels there's a public policy, but it has to be based on a statute. and we cited several cases, and the law professors in professor alderman and braucher's brief cited a variety of cases around the country in which courts have only struck down contracts for public policy where they violated a statute that forbid equality.
but 
the case in state court went up on a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court, reversed by the state court of appeal, and then affirmed by the california supreme court.
that's exactly the issue. and 
but you don't  you don't know of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving the federal government of property.
yes, yes.
thank you, mr. baker. the case is submitted.
as  as to  as to whether the evidence that you learn from the wesley trial  that's a much closer question because the  the aggravating factor in this case 
in that case 
may i ask you a question about 8 the competence of counsel issue? one  i'm  i'm very 9 sympathetic to the problems of busy lawyers who have so 10 much to do and they're preparing for a penalty hearing. 11 but one  one aspect of this case  i hope you'll 12 comment  and that is, the fact that the prosecutor had 13 told the defense they were going to use certain 14 aggravating circumstances, and the files in those  15 relating to those circumstances were available in the 16 courthouse. and as i understand  and you correct me if 17 i'm wrong  counsel did not examine those files, and had 18 he examined those files, he would have opened the door to 19 a wealth of information. isn't that a fairly serious 20 mistake by the lawyer?
 ninth circuit 
all right. let's  let's assume that the  that the partisans who do the mid-term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we can do. and the limits are the traditional ones, compactness, et cetera. let us assume that there is, in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to conform to those districting principles. under those circumstances, is the mid-term redistricting equally illegitimate?
then why don't you have to say at that stage, if there is silence on the part of the government, he's got to find the violation?
to set the charge. i mean, that's circular. to set the charge that it gives you.
may i ask you about, there's another question you haven't really touched on yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in the internal procedure. i'd just like a little help on just exactly what happens. the prisoner doesn't get the kind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he only knows it because either the low level person says no, the doctors said you can't have it. and he brings a proceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and they deny relief. and then later on when he wants to sue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the doctor who was involved, and there are several levels of authority making the decision. does he have to start all over again to name those people, or what does he do?
then what is the answer?
may i ask you a question? assume the case had been tried and you could not tell from either the indictment or the instructions to the jury whether it was a generic burglary or a nongeneric burglary. would the  our decision permit us to look at the transcript of the trial to answer that question?
 the court could do the same thing here.
well, that's 
that's statutory. i just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory 
as far as  as far as this particular protocol, this particular protocol that's  that's utilized and that we're  we're challenging is unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain. if the  if the sedative works, and there's no  and  and the person is not in  not in wanton and gratuitous type of  of pain, as  as this court's precedents hold, that would be constitutional. it's the  it's the evidence that's coming forward that this is not what's happening that gives rise to our claim that  that we would like to be able to litigate in a 1983 action so that we can get those facts before the court.
we 
you also run into a problem with the  some states classify a contract as voidable and other states for that same ground make it void. so at least you would have  you would lose the uniformity if you've made the distinction between those two.
no. in fact, in their answer, justice stevens, they admitted that they were the manager of the apartment, that they had run it through their agents. they acknowledged that it was their policies that were in effect. there wouldn't have been a basis that would have survived rule 11 that would have given lincoln property company a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit. and so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear that they are a proper party defendant. we've always taken the position that if we are found liable, we would pay a judgment. the issue is that we don't think we're liable, because we think that the allegations in the complaint are completely baseless. and that's what the district court found when it held, on summary judgment, that there was not a dispute of fact as to the core allegations of the complaint. returning to the point i was trying to make about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the courts to consider whether there are indispensable parties. and what the court did here was to take a rule 19 kind of inquiry  is a non-named defendant really an indispensable party, such that dismissal of the action is warranted?  and to engraft that onto a jurisdictional inquiry. but the reason why we have the rules of civil procedure is, of course, to follow them. and what the fourth circuit did here was, it took that kind of analysis, but it didn't follow the standards that the courts have set out for applying rule 19 properly.
well, two things you might comment on. first, the in whole or in part, you might take account of the fact that there are other negligent actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury to the employee. secondly, section 53 does not contain the language in whole or in part.
mr. barnett i thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement. that it would be enough if it was the kind of parallel action that suggested an agreement that over nine years they all raised the price at the same time. now that doesn't really give the defendant notice of, you know, what individuals were responsible for this, when it occurred. but you say that would still be adequate?
 by saying, "do nothing. so long as you don't even try to go through the prison grievance system, you can come directly into court." it seems to me this 
okay. a bus station is different, though.
 what the government was doing in this instance was attempting to give content to the word "corruptly" that would enable the jurors to know that they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.
i don't think it's the only factor, but i was responding to the question of what should a prosecutor do and in fact what most prosecutors do in most cases.
well, and i 
to what extent is the congress's purpose later than the congress that enacted the statute we're construing? the statute we're construing was enacted by one congress and these expressions came later.
what  what page was that?
because that could be changed at the whim of the legislature, your honor, and the legislature could change that assessment to increase the debt limit and  while lowering taxes and altering any tax liability.
well, how does  how does your analysis apply? let's say these employees had to change their equipment several times during the course of the day.
i agree. and let me talk, then, about the  why we believe the text of the statute demonstrates that congress intended to leave the decision about what is, and is not, a legitimate medical practice to the states, as it has always been. and that's the key question in this case, because the u.s. attorney general 
exactly. if  if the term enterprise appeared in 1962(c) but were an undefined term 
scott did not know that was it.
why would you feel better about our doing that in order to determine whether  whether there's a public use than you would feel our doing it in order to decide whether there's been a taking?
well, your honor, i think  i think there are several reasons. one  and, again, this court  these are  all of the things i'm going to list come from this court's cases, including nix and murray and segura, where the court has applied the doctrines we ask the court to apply here. and what you have is, you have the inherent incentive to knock and announce, because of their own safety concerns. we think the only thing that might not cover, in terms of deterrence, would be the additional few moments you may want them to wait. they will announce, and they will delay some period of time. now, in the absence of concerns about safety or destruction of evidence, the officers have nothing to gain by entering prematurely. and so, in doing a deterrence analysis, i think it's important to keep that in mind. it's not like there's a huge gain for the officers 
okay, the opposing candidate or the state.
but i 
yes, you are.
so you're changing your answer. you originally told me that, no, that that wouldn't fit because it's the same job.
that's not what the ninth circuit said in this case.
and congress took that explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be canceled at any time for genericism. escalator, aspirin are all examples of your situation. that's exactly what happened, and when they came a generic term, that trademark was canceled and it became used as generic. congress took that into account.
if you'd  if i could direct you, justice ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. and two, paragraph (k), that tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business 
well 
that's correct. and in the engert case itself, the california supreme court indicated that "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" would be a valid sentencing consideration; it just wasn't a valid narrowing consideration.
sorry.
and what's  what's your best authority for that?
well, could the  could the ins have just stayed its hand for  in 
i think it's  it would be equally inconsistent with the state's current position if we look at ja 35 where the prosecutor's response was we didn't need that instruction because firearm was not an element of the crime charged.
no. but there are some. it is not a non-existent occurrence in.
when you talk about that tie, your approach applies in the case  a dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms off of it, nine people say, "sure, come on in and search," and the one person says, "no." that one person exercises a veto over a search of the common area?
i  i  you  you have the wrong one. i meant the one that said that applications to the court of appeals are  are  require leave to appeal. what's the effect of that?
in that case, i missed the point of your 
 correct me if i'm wrong about that.
well, it sits to decide whether people should be indicted, and yes, they're supposed to determine whether there's probable cause, but historically a significant role for the grand official jury has been not to indict people even though the government had the evidence to indict them.
i guess, justice souter, that i would wonder what it would mean to say that you read the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. if what it means is that a plaintiff can simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in order to create the strong inference of state of mind that is ultimately required, then i think i would disagree that that rule remains in effect. precisely because our view is that in applying the strong inference standard, a court should consider other possible explanations for the defendant's conduct that are not foreclosed by the allegations 
maybe this day  in today's world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail. that is, i don't think  my understanding is that the post office, unlike fedex and unlike ups, if you're not home, they leave a  a notice, you know, and you check a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off the next day. we don't live in a  my wife isn't home. my wife works. and  and most wives no longer stay home to get the mail, and we don't all have butlers at the door. and you call up the post office. they say, oh  if you get through to a human being, which takes 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say, phone the post office branch. and they say go get in the car, find a parking place, get in the line, and there's half a morning gone. now, why is that a reasonable way? why can't they do what fedex does? this is a world  husband works, wife works, two children are screaming. we've got to get them to the doctor. we have to have them at school. they have appointments all morning, and there's nobody home. so whatever they did with mullane and said registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to use that system rather than use fedex's system?
well, in  singleton is a case in which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who provided medicaid abortions.
well 
but then you're doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
i don't  i don't think that that is true. it should not and does not turn on the words that you use in your petition. what it turns on is the fundamental nature of the injury that you claim and of the relief that you seek. one reason why you don't need to be necessarily concerned about this is that in all of these cases in which one case has gone to judgment and there is a  either a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going to cover these. the only extension of rooker-feldman that sabic is asking for is what they call the actually litigated test. that is the heart of the full faith and credit act.
but why is that the minimum? wouldn't the minimum be just to dismiss those parties who don't have the aggregate  the necessary jurisdictional amount?
you 
well, justice breyer, let me answer both pieces of that. i certainly think that such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states. there is a reference to the first military order. i believe there's also a reference to any other subsequent orders implementing that. all of that, together, implements the november 13th order. so, i would think that there is  it is very easy to read this language to allow any challenge that is being brought here, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge.
yes.
it would be closer to it but the court would still have to confront the question of whether it would be appropriate to infer a constitutional tort under the just compensation clause. and we would urge the court not to do so. there is an overarching question here of qualified immunity. whatever is true with respect to whether this new constitutional tort should be created towards other claims before the court, the petitioners on this case were not on clear notice that their actions in responding to someone who had systematically violated the rules and regulations, which  on the books for some time  would subject them to personal damages actions and in fact treble damages under the rico statute. for that, for that 
the court's admonition that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence but argument of counsel relegated the statements of the prosecutor to that of an advocate and did not take the prosecutor's arguments and elevate it in place of the instructions given 
it is not finished 
it's only binding 
my anticipation would be that most courts would use their factfinding authority to try to figure out what work would have to be reduplicated in the state court, to compensate that work, or the work that only arose by virtue of it being in federal court.
you mean on  in your case.
exactly. you've simply substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the district court following circuit law for the guidelines. and 
because the  it wouldn't necessarily, on an episodic basis. but what you have in this case is substantial price discrimination across time, which this court held, under morton salt, triggers an inference of competitive injury.
about the argument. where i read  no, i cannot point to specific language in the majority opinion that says "and defense counsel gets to make an argument based on this, and the jury must consider that." that comes from this court's case law of how mitigating evidence must be treated once it is  -
i didn't quite hear that, justice ginsburg.
no, i do not. we're relying to the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on deadlines that have come out. we have the equitable tolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. and, you know, in this case, specific assurance by a court which in a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do something in connection with the case. the old harris truck case is where the lawyer was on vacation. the judge said well, i'll give you some extra time. even though they knew of the judgment, they knew the time would run, he said i'll give you extra time to file the appeal because you want to contact the lawyer who was on vacation. the court of appeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because you knew of the order, so  but that was overlooked even though by time calculation, everybody was out of time. the eberhart case, they were out of time because the motion for new trial was filed untimely, which under the rule required a timely filing of a motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal time. so this, obviously the motion to reopen was timely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by the rule. the other side was served. the other side had no objection to it and didn't oppose it. the real issue when you look at an equitable  sort of an equitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced, and obviously they are not prejudiced.
the wire fraud statute is applicable to schemes to defraud, generally speaking. the questions in this case are whether there is a common law rule that should be read to provide background.
 i was just asking if we can import the same formal rule we now have and reach  and  if we don't consider the same things in harmless-error analysis.
it certainly matters for plaintiffs in this situation.
seems like a big loophole.
well, then you would have had no problem.
except  let me just interrupt. supposing he did identify, say you can only use pentobarbital on me, the same way they do it for a veterinarian. and the  and the judge says, well, i don't think that's required. but he would then be satisfied the 1983 requirement?
it has  it has happened, on various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to establish the validity of 
well, do you have confidence 
i agree, your honor.
well, to the extent that the court views the constitutional issue in this case as sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of constitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the better view, the view that is more consistent with congress's intent, is that if the court is choosing between raising the standard at the pre stage and watering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we believe that the former is more consistent with congress's 
well, and we disagree with those claims. we think that most of those claims  to the extent that he thinks some procedural requirement is provided either by the geneva convention, if applicable  but we don't think it would be  and that argument would be made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the law of war that a procedure is required 
yes, your honor, that is  that is what i'm suggesting, that the same rule would apply. now, i would add 
your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle. it is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other. it's that official in the latter place, they said modification as defined in the first place.
 me there.
well, ms. karlan, let me put one other element in here. was  was your client specifically told by the flra to bring a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement?
 definiteness would still require that you distinctly claim an invention here and that's one of the things that's absent in this case. but even moving beyond that, your honor 
maybe they don't get retaliated against if they testify at trial.
uh-huh.
wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking? it does tell you to disregard leas, which suggests the ranking  at least to me, that the ranking ought to be of leas and not pupils.
well, if it isn't their law, then i don't know how  why they affirmed this conviction rather than reversing it.
yes.
i mean, you assert that they would be able to sue.
in our view the rule does not allow any other circumstances. rule 41 does not allow any other circumstances. if that authority 
but rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the plra where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved. so if in fact, just to follow on justice kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation?
you know, there's a general agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't apply when the government is engaged in a commercial activity. now, why shouldn't something similar apply to government regulation which ends up discriminating against out of state businesses, when the government is engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the restrictions of the commerce clause? why isn't that a reasonable rule?
even  that was the question 2 i was going to ask. with respect to  he came into 3 federal court and he said  a little  like 3 days too 4 late to move to extend the time to file the 2255. that 5 motion was denied. that motion was made in april of '97, 6 and then he doesn't file for state habeas to get rid of 7 those prior convictions until february of '98. is  is 8 there any indication of why, when the federal court says 9 we're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to 10 go to the state court?
but, chief justice roberts, then the assumption would have to be that this court was deciding the four counts, in terms of violence and threats of violence, even though it wasn't presented in the cert petition, even though it wasn't briefed, and even though it was never discussed in this court's opinion. and i think it was quite logical for the seventh circuit to say the appropriate thing to do is to let the district court decide whether any injunctive relief was appropriate, based on those four counts; and, if so, what that provision of the hobbs act means.
yes.
your honor 
in fact, there was a finding that johns' testimony was credible.
i thought your theory was, at least as i read your brief, that your loss occurs at the moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at a later time.
in other words, never approached the harmlessness thing. that's what the dissenters thought.
well, but the rule  the rule says that the first report, the document 1, has to be given deference. whether it's presumed to be correct.
mr. chief justice, i want to answer one question related to that. the collective bargaining agreement did not cover the forklift. that's in the trial transcript on page 524. it was a new position. it was not covered by the collective bargaining. so they 
an individual who is growing it for her  him- or herself, who has  or has a caregiver growing it for her 
i think at a high level of generality, that is true. because what the sentencing commission is good at is taking paradigmatic circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that will transfer into a sentence. and what the strength of the district judge is is looking at the defendant in front of that particular judge and seeing how that person's characteristics may map onto the policies of sentencing. but i don't agree that that distinction would support a two-track form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences. that is exactly the situation that we had in the pre sentencing reform act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and impose a widely disparate sentence. and as the court well knows, there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didn't exercise discretion at all. now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime, i always give the same sentence. that would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an exercise of discretion. but in the pre sentencing reform act era, the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered. if we continue with that same sort of deference on appeal in the booker remedial opinion, then it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some consistency and uniformity in the way district judges impose sentencing.
more likely. more likely.
well, are you suggesting  did  did the warrant  i don't know this. i should but i don't. did the warrant authorize seizure of guns as well as 
does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the government ultimately proves? simply because he said the company is guilty of cheating the government, even though the facts on which he bases it are entirely wrong?
 is contrary to that.
so that if 
that's exactly right. and it's a very important point. because for example, when this court recognized that the bible reading in doremus did not give rise to taxpayer standing, that didn't stop the parents who were directly injured by the same practice in shemp from bringing an establishment clause 
every usury case, for example. that's very few? i mean, that's a lot of cases.
and your submission  your submission is that every juror is, or a reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is more likely to be violent in the future? as opposed to the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because of this, that he should  mercy should be shown to him in light of all of this? and i just don't see how you can speculate which way the jury is going to go.
and  and i think your honor is correct. the prosecutor's point in this case was we shouldn't litigate 
okay.
well, your honor, the ninth circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive, or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be found in the english language anywhere, it doesn't describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately used when this is applied.
no, not straight out, but what they  they have the right to make their own decision and compromise their own claim. the beneficiary may think it's 20 cents on the dollar. the state may think  the state can consider two things and two things only.
she would not have a disincentive to cooperate. she might not have an incentive to cooperate because they're bringing their own lawsuit.
in a different sense i'm saying it. in terms of computing whether a time bar is on the merits, the court has not used that concept, which does relate to some sort of civil proceedings. plaut would make it appear first to money judgment type cases. but the court has not used that standard, for example, in martinez-villareal, has not used it in slack v. mcdaniel. instead, the court has not looked at the nomenclature of the order that dismissed the case or denied this case. instead, the court looks to did the  the court below address the claims of the petitioner. and of course, a claim of statute of limitations is not a claim of a petitioner. that's an affirmative defense of the state.
even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?
i think it might be a vessel, but probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in mothballs.
no, but there was in the patent case, though, mr. olson. we relied on the fact that the patent law changed.
well, because he's an american citizen.
what if i think that opinion was just flatly wrong, that congress, when it referred to the "principal activity or activities," was talking about the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the person to do? he didn't hire him to put on clothes. what if i think that? why do i have to extend what i think to be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?
 do you have any information in  to the question i asked earlier  in the states that have said, "school district, you bear the burden," do we know whether there's more litigation? do we know whether there has been a notable increase in the costs in those states that have placed the burden on the school districts?
well, that seems to me 
how do you explain, mr. mills, the language that the court used, pointing out how different this kind of a case would have been from the  from the zadvydas case?
the scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity. i thought that that  that flat fee was applicable to every motor carrier that went on the roads in pennsylvania.
is the best evidence, but not the sole evidence.
fine. then we look at stringer and clemons, and they're making exceptions to zant. and they're making exceptions for "weighing" states. so, even if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it made no difference to the evidence  that is, to what really happened in the world  still, says clemons and stringer  still, you're not home free yet, state. rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error analysis. so, the answer, i think, to justice scalia, if i understand it, is, justice scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons. now, if i'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong? what you really ought to do is say, "court, always conduct harmless-error analysis. conduct it whether you're in 'non-weighing,' conduct it whether you're in 'weighing.' we'll simplify." now, what would be so terrible about that?
it's different, your honor, but i don't think it's that much different, and the reason is that this makes the crime a function of awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried consideration of those consequences. and then counsel argues to the jury that brewer is uncapable of engaging in that sort of premeditation because of his mental problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability under the circumstances. and i think if you combine the argument and the definition, which we were bound to do under boyde versus california, we're supposed to look at the entire context of the trial here, that that meets that suggestion in penry for it. it's not exactly what the court suggested.
because relying on the lawyer to do the duty of the state does not effectuate the fundamental interest the treaty serves, which is establishing direct contact between the consular officer and the lawyer.
 was my point earlier. they can't make short shrift of those cases, because they're not going to be thrown out at the pleading stage. they're going to have to progress at least to summary judgment, probably in every case in which an employee is terminated, because now one of his defenses against termination is, "you're violating my first amendment rights."
 they pay for it.
i think another way to perhaps characterize your position is, why is this like a commission that they are seeking. and the reason why is because that number may be very different than 24 cents. if there was such a commission that could exist, it would be far less. and the respondents are not seeking that amount of money. official
yes, but did those documents  did those boxes contain the key documents 
explain it  explain your theory in terms of the example. that is, imagine that the benefits of the network of dealers of gasoline into the community are fabulous and obvious. so there's a great reason for doing this. now, why is it that, on your theory, the government shouldn't have to pay compensation then, but it should have to pay compensation just because the benefits are not obvious, that they're bizarre, that they don't  may not really exist? that's  you see why i'm having a problem?
what would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the  was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant? would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?
well, the creditors are hurt because in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case is filed, the trustee takes possession of all the debtor's property, which becomes property of the estate. the trustee's role is to liquidate the property and distribute the proceeds to creditors. when the case is converted to chapter 13, under 1306, the property revests in the debtor, including any concealed property. at that point, under section 348, upon conversion, the chapter 7 trustee is disenfranchised. his services terminate. what debtors in bankruptcy who are perpetuating this kind of concealment scheme want you to do is say oh no, you can go ahead and convert, and then maybe we'll deal with it later, because maybe later on official in the proceedings something will happen. the chapter 13 trustee might not be apprised of it. the case might go to a different bankruptcy judge. in some jurisdictions, the chapter 13 docket is heard by an entirely separate bankruptcy judge. they would like to get the benefit of delay in conversion, because perhaps they can get away with it in the subsequent chapter 13 case. or alternatively in the chapter 13 case, if the debtor doesn't file a plan, then the chapter 13 trustee, who may have hundreds and hundreds of chapter 13 cases he or she is responsible for, on a check list might simply check off no plan filed, case dismissed, in which case the creditors don't get the benefit of the liquidation, they don't get the benefit of the assets being recovered, they don't get equality of distribution under the chapter 7 scheme, and the debtor's fraud is in essence gotten away with. so that is why, when a motion to convert comes up and the bankruptcy court sees 
that would be rather like pan american and grace saying that, panagra, charge whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below $50 because remember, we, grace, have some ships out there and we want people to take the ships.
under the court's definition in swancc and riverside, the answer again is no.
there was nobody  there was no one on it 
that's right, because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank.
yes, your honor, i  our position is that the eighth amendment does not require that as a mitigating factor, that that is not one of the circumstances of the offense, certainly not  it doesn't go to the defendant's character or background.
 it would  it would be fair, but to call it a finding of california state law is a  would be a bit of a stretch, wouldn't it? i mean, you  you've made a perfectly good argument that it would be a sensible rule for california 
 prevention of pollution.
no. it was decided on cross motions for summary judgment in the district court, and there were no findings, actually no factual findings at all, and certainly nothing on that particular point.
your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract. it's an equitable claim. it's an age-old subrogation right. you just sue in equity saying, look, i paid the medical expenses, i'm entitled to it. you don't need the contractual provision at all.
they  it did not get notice of the dismissal. no, it did not, your honor. we do not know what happened, but we did not get notice of the dismissal until after the case was dismissed.
well, but it used broad language, "any scheme to defraud by means of wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce."
would he have to come up 
am i correct, though, this entity we're talking about is not a party to the case?
all of this jurisprudence is based on the eighth amendment requirement 
they 
that's  that's exactly right, your honor.
 goes uncontested 
but if i could walk you through those provisions because i think they're quite important. the first provision says, as you say, all real and personal property which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall be transferred to the united states.
is that  what you're saying is academic because the statute doesn't require a federal spending hook. it says it has the other commerce peg. i take it you  you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that every state in fact gets federal funds for their prison systems.
well, he wouldn't have had  because he would have had no record. that is, the review under the apa by the district court would have been based on the evidentiary record he made. and the ibla specifically ruled that it would not entertain evidence about the reasons that the blm officials had for going after him. there would be no evidence to support his claim.
it's very clear. this is at pages 136 and 137 of the joint appendix, page 140 of the joint appendix, and again at pages 252 and 253 of the joint appendix. the trial court said there is nothing to corroborate these confessions. now, contrast chambers 
no. the  i mean, it seems to me that the  the whole point of the argument you're making is it won't hurt me, the landowner, quite so much, but if it doesn't make sense at all, why should we even have to get to that question? why isn't the more sensible thing to say to the government, stop doing it?
that's the way the arizona 
yes, your honor.
but the fact that this is a group decision leads to even a greater risk of abdication of 
 i'm thinking  what i'm thinking is that where  where you're trying to reach a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated. i'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably calculated to reach the average person unless it gives him the choice of getting it when he's not home. all right? now, there are two ways that could happen. one, you could modify that form or, second, the simple rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a letter.
well, that's right. the  and i  i don't think that undercuts our argument at all, because, after all, there's no question that, prior to 1996, there was offset authority in the government to offset  to collect debt against other types of income, other than social security. so, i don't think that undercuts our argument at all. but let me, if i might, go back to your question one more time, because i think there's yet a third answer, which is  which is the chronological answer that  made in our briefs that, in 1991, the congress could not have had the intent to get at social security benefits at all, because, of course, there  and it's  this point is conceded  the government had no authority whatsoever to offset social security benefits. if i might, in the  let me go 
yes, because the magistrate has determined that there's probable cause to believe that at the time of the search, the contraband, the purpose of the search, will be present in that particularly described location.
yes. and it took the position there that "in connection with" did have a broad construction. and that position was rejected.
has there been any movement in the legislature to change the law so you won't be in this situation where there is no death penalty?
well, i have four answers. i hope i can get them out. if heck instead of adopting a rule of accrual and denying existence of a cause of action had established the federal tolling rule, saying that these causes of action are tolled while you're in custody, that would have solved the problem.
you know, i could say whether i'm there 23 hours or all or not 
well 
i think that 
like it 
 is it open in this case to  for this court to apply that, not avena?
but i imagine they'll say that simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to get us to think seriously about it.
yes, so it's a old hydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel. i mean, is that  does that fit your definition of a "discharge"? in other words, it restrains the water temporarily.
that's exactly 
this is the record that did exist.
i mean, i don't have the experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say whether it would be one way or the other. you're saying  and i'll repeat that. is there anything at all i could look to try to figure this out? because i think it is a question we're supposed to get the better rule. what did the model penal code authors do? did they take testimony 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
but with respect, in the context of the internal government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the 
in those treaties where the courts then looked to the treaty to help decide who owned what property, they used it as a rule of decision. do those cases  treaties all use the word individually enforceable rights?
and in the  in the walton case, this court found that a functionally identical provision in arizona, even though the burden remained on the defendant, was appropriate after the state had met the requirements of guided discretion, as well as the individualized sentencing requirement, in setting about a  proving that, "this defendant is more deserving of death than anybody else convicted of the same crime."
thank you, mr. landau. mr. bland.
no. not, in the criminal case, the prosecutor is responsible  be, as it was in this case, although the judge refused to follow stevens 
what do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these 26 confidential people tell you? but you haven't seen the report, so you don't have the date on it? and you won't know that date unless you have access to discovery. do you have to assume the date is later rather than sooner?
but, in fact, section 2415(f), which is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief, makes it clear that whether something is denominated a complaint or not does not determine whether or not it's covered by the limitations period. 2415(f) is an exception for counterclaims and offsets by the government where a private party brings an action against the government. but counterclaims and offsets typically aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the answer, they're submitted in the answer. therefore, whether it's denominated an "order," an "answer," or something else, doesn't control whether or not 2415 applies. 2415 applies to any action for money damages founded on a contract, however you might denominate the initial filing which commences the proceedings. in 
 in number three?
that 
yes 
well, to stop the idea that everything can be localized.
excellent. that was an excellent answer. (laughter.)
so your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?
the court, the court of criminal appeals did not invoke this basis for saying that his trial objection was inadequate. they didn't say that it was made at the wrong time, or in the wrong  what they specifically said 
would you or not?
where  can you tell us where it was raised below?
but don't you agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely because we were talking about a selection of one person or another? the word "sorting" has been used in this context because everybody gets to go to school. indeed, they are required to go to school. so no one gets left out of the system, and i think there have been court of appeals judges who have noted. we have never had that case before, not like the affirmative action cases.
 which seems to go to your argument, which is centered around the unbridled discretion of the officer. and the california supreme court is saying it's not unbridled.
on the point that you're arguing, whether the critical language means the person's own sale, or not 
no, the point is that if he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his claim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time limit.
it's different when you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has official visitation right and then doesn't report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison. that's quite a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.
yick wo.
well, you're saying that there is a uniformity between a master contract between the united states and blue cross on the one hand, and blue cross and the subscriber on the other hand. but doesn't the united states approve the latter contract? in other words, doesn't it  well, i forget the initials  opm or whatever it is. doesn't it have a  a requirement of approval going to the terms of the contract between empire and  and the employee before that contract goes into effect?
with respect  with respect, justice breyer, i think you're underestimating the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that walked by going to plymouth rock okay thinking i was going to see a nice historical exhibit, and is and to see a church, wouldn't bring a  an action. and that there wouldn't be article iii standing for that particular individual, not the taxpayer 
not if there's no chapter 13.
 what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion? that would eliminate the good-faith element, wouldn't it?
well, it's  except for the  it seems to me except for  for your  your argument is  is fine except for one problem. and that is, if we  if we assume that congress was being as  as cautious as you suggest, then congress' caution, in effect, was  was allowing an end run around the regulation for the reasons we went into a moment ago. all you've got to do is  is dump the pollutant further  far enough upstream in the watershed and you get away scot-free. and it's very difficult to believe that congress could have intended that.
they did not. justice  justice scalia, they did not.
 would seem to present the same commerce clause problem that you're posing for us today.
the migratory bird rule case where we said there had to be a significant nexus. but i think what the court is asking you is  is how to define significant nexus. we're  if you want us just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the corps of engineers should use its expertise to come up with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for us to write.
well, your honor, i think  again, first of all, it's a  it's important to understand that we are saying he will have to file, in all circumstances. it's not necessarily clear 
well, but, as justice ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case involving spectators. so it's not contrary to clearly established law. we have cases stating the general principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an unreasonable application. but "contrary to" seems an awful stretch.
well, the consequence of removal is more serious 
 is that the inter vivos  a  a claim for a  the texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding. and for that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.
they have attempted, justice ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways. they've said that it is a physical and structural thing, something that's on the golden master disk. and then they say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but that in the abstract never becomes a part of the computer.
thank you, counsel. general clement.
well, it would be on the joint appendix, pages 38 and 39, where he describes the lockdown. and, you know, i haven't looked at it recently, but my understanding is that he was suggesting that he had had access to nothing, including the prison library. and the attorney general suggests that there was a paging system, but the documentary evidence that the attorney general puts into the record, which is on pages 68  67  no, pardon me, 88 through 96  is a prison manual that's dated 2000. now, it says it's amended. but my client takes the position that this wasn't in the place at his prison at that time, and that would require a 
that you say 
well, then any effort to suspend the writ would be invalid. but this is not a case where there's any question of 
thank you, mr. clement. mr. friedman?
that's a different argument. i'm  i'm just quarreling over whether it originated that way. if you want to say 
 doesn't affect his reentry at all. his reentry occurred. it  how could it possibly have anything to do with his reentry?
no, they don't, your honor, but all of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed race to corporations under circumstances where their  their contractual rights have been violated because of the race of their shareholders or employees. and that has been well-settled, at least in the courts of appeals.
but isn't it just the case  you've made several arguments, but you have a case that's lodged in the court of appeals. it's not simply a petition there. they have accepted it for review.
well, i  i thought that judge sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before any loss was incurred, even if there's been a misrepresentation, recovery should be denied.
well, i don't see anything in the opinion about  i just see the issue before the court was does this come under the heading race.
what did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing? the compact administration under the chairmanship of the united states representative may again be seen as the best way to administer their compact and settle issues. what was he talking about?
well, we didn't know that because there weren't any, because this man didn't commit that crime. we are talking  in the hypothetical, i think we should set, start with mr. wallace being an innocent man, who was arrested unlawfully, who gives an involuntarily  an involuntary false confession. and on the basis of that is held for eight and a half years, finally wins the case, is set free, and then sues the 
mr. gornstein, why should we listen to the solicitor general rather than the eeoc? i mean, they have taken a different position from the one that you're urging upon us.
yes, justice ginsburg, there would be 1254 review. once the provision is in the court of appeals, then the case would be under  under e(3), the review provision  then the case would be in the court of appeals for purposes of this court's 1254 jurisdiction.
there is not a new resolution.
did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?
that's happened any number of times. the guagliardo cases that we cite in our brief provide one example. and as justice holmes made the point there, it's not a situation where you go after this court's appellate jurisdiction, as such. there, it's a situation, as justice holmes put it, that, when the root is cut, the branches fall; when the district court loses jurisdiction over these cases, then this court loses jurisdiction. but it's much less of an affront to this court than the kind of statute that congress passed in the mcardle situation.
but you don't know, the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country.
well, what  what 
yes. now i  and that was the point 
yes. yes, but it's true addiction. and this seems to 
or you say, they treated me negligently. that's a fact. that means something happened there. but suppose you write the complaint and there is just no notion that you have a what and when, how, under what circumstances. it's just totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't know what, what period of time he is supposed to be thinking about, what, what happens to such a complaint? there must be some law on it in torts or someplace?
i'm not saying  they reduced to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.
for other cases 
 no, but i realize that  could we pause on that for a second? because you apparently take the position  the government takes the position that when  under the governing law, the government would have an affirmative burden, ultimately, to defend  in this case, on compelling interest, least restrictive, et cetera  that, at the preliminary injunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the burden to negate the probability that the government will carry its burden on the ultimate issue. and i don't see why that should be so at all.
well, i understand 
sure. i think it affects anyone who had illegally reentered, at least. but it's important to bear in mind that this is somebody who was already subject to a removal order. so, in some sense, sending them back out of the country puts them in the same position that they would have been in under the old removal order. and so, insofar as it has that effect on them, i think it's different than a $50 penalty that attaches to the primary conduct of illegal reentry, as such.
yes. so i mean 
no, justice stevens. it's our view that you really ought not be looking or focusing on the police officer motive or on the governmental agent's motive for the very reason that you start to get into these knotty questions of what exactly were they trying to accomplish. and we believe a better  a better default than  if you can't simply answer it by looking at history and precedent, is to look more towards the declarant's reasonable expectation. and that's what this court does in the fifth amendment when it 
so  so do we have the tape here?
it goes into some pot of fungible money and it's other money used. so instead of using other money, you use land. does that make a difference?
because  two reasons, your honor  in the real world, what happens is the distributor picks up the fuel at the rack and delivers it to the retailer. if the  if the distributor takes the fuel and holds it, he's not a distributor under the statute. a distributor is somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers. that's in  on page 2(a) of the red brief, your honor. so that 
right.
we think it's a first  i'm sorry.
it wouldn't have even raised the issue had it not been for the earlier federal holding. isn't that correct?
well, why not?
i agree with that. but i want  what i think the court is trying to find is some explanation of the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a voluntary initiation. now, i think we agree  or at least i agree  that there shouldn't be any miranda warnings required. that doesn't go into the mix.
 you told us additional evidence on deliberation can be put in the  in the sentencing phase. but then you're saying that you're not going to do that.
yes, your honor, we do, because in valley forge, first of all, as justice ginsburg said, the court relied on the fact that it was a property clause claim. there is a passage in valley forge that refers to executive action, but the court in kendrick when it talked about valley forge said, in characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant to the property clause. and we think those things are tied together and there's a reason why. in the appropriations context, there always is congressional action with respect to the very money that's at issue because there has to be a congressional appropriation. that's not true in the property context. congress doesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the 58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid of.
because there  it does not relate to the same injury. in habeas, by contrast, the injury is the custody that's in violation of the constitution laws and treaties 
do you agree with mr. goldstein that nothing turns on  one might characterize this kind of cruise as u.s.-centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a u.s. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ada applies? do you agree with that interpretation?
mr. richards, can i ask you this question. supposing that you were allowed to have discovery and each chief executive of the defendant companies got on the stand and said: i never talked to my, my competitors at all, i never seriously considered competing in the other, other company's territory for the reasons set forth in the, in your opponent's brief on the merits here. we never did agree. and you're able to prove the things you've alleged in the agreement. would the, would it be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you on that testimony if you had no evidence of a specific agreement?
his counsel will have raised them. and  and most, if not all, of those have to have been raised by counsel.
his answer to me is that  that  it's sort of misleading to think of this as if it's just information, because it's really a method that switches things at a level of detail that is impossible to put in a patent application. it's taking the information in a patent application, it's transforming it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not really even 1's and 0's. what they are is things that happen with electricity.
because he  he is the trier of fact, and i think at that point 
i don't think the state  could the state do that? is that the question?
benitez has been released to a half-way house. we sent the court a letter 
that's a different matter. that's a  what  i'm saying, what authority is there  have there been cases in which that was not viewed? after all, let's suppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same customers. they overlap. their territories are close. logical to think people shop around for trucks. and we have in the record one item where they  one instance in which they found the customer, and he said, "yeah, i did  i did go and shop in both. i lost"  the disfavored dealer lost the sale.
and so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.
may i go just back to justice breyer's question for a second?
 to nollan and dolan. and that was litigated here.
but again 
for example, one of the congressional interests described in the finding is avoiding fetal pain to the fetus. and i guess they don't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20 weeks there is some risk of pain. and that seems to me, that could affect a calculus very dramatically for the woman making the decision.
suppose it didn't have the ten commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good. it said religion is the foundation of our institutions. suppose there were something like that. would that be bad?
do they have standing?
what the second circuit said, which i think is correct, is that that becomes a level of line-drawing that we don't think congress did intend to get into.
the other way around? (laughter.)
but my question is assuming a state procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was permissible, you  you would say double jeopardy clause would bar that appeal.
are you limiting your point to putting information on the package, or are you saying they could  could california compel a cigarette  companies to contribute to a large fund which is just used to by newspaper advertising describing the dangers of smoking? could they do that?
yes, well, they went back later and  and made up for their mistake. but  but the  it seems to me the issue is whether a mistake was made that  that was final action that hurt her. i don't see why  it's certainly official action. i mean, you can't say 
i mean, what did he do? draw a map or what? (laughter.)
i see that on the 
but there  but as analyzed by the california supreme court, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements. and as i was saying, to do so, the jury would have had to 
significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. the implication is that a decision to order psychiatric testing is a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or  or working conditions.
 is that the guidance of the court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to address that issue and to resolve it. it is fairly in front of you.
so what  what you're saying is the conviction itself didn't show that, and so the question is whether you can look to documents that in fact showed it.
you do not what? do not think he's covered by the jones act?
correct.
yes, because it's not in the briefs 
well, now, wait. under the due process clause, i assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report. you  if  if you're really relying on morgan ii, he who hears must decide, i think you would be saying that after reading the report, you should have the opportunity to argue to the  to dawson here, to  to the tax court judge that the report should not be adopted.
it  it is would.
your honor, i don't have those statistics. i would  i think it's probably true that in most instances it's the parents who are initiating the hearing. that would not have been news to congress, however. congress, in the statute  and this is one of the things that we think is important, bearing on the burden of proof  placed on parents the obligation to plead their case  that is, to identify both the problem with the educational plan that they've seen  and this is in 20 u.s.c. 1450(b)(7)  as well as the proposed solution that they would  that they would like to see the court adopt. now 
but there is a breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a crime. the statistics cited in the government's brief say that in an april 2001 report prepared by the california criminal justice statistics center, 68 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison  68 percent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 13 percent for the commission of a new felony offense. i mean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that may call for breathtaking 
then that's out  fine, that's out of the case. the next question is  of course you could sue a real company, called lincoln property or jolly fisherman, and it could turn out that that real company is a front, that it has no real existence, its  all its papers and everything to do with it is signed by a totally separate corporation. are you saying that's what happened here? and if that's what happened here, which is the real corporation and people in interest?
in black they said exactly what you say.
this argument, this argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or not it is a new rule.
you  you  then you think that congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress.
 to support  supporting speech is somewhat different from supporting activities that you don't agree with. i mean, the first amendment makes a fundamental difference in that respect.
 and the abilities of local governments to function?
you know, usually a complaint, you're  you make your point, and say, "what do you say? what's your answer?"
no, i don't think he  i didn't 
well, your honor 
are there any other plans that are  are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?
counsel, can i move you south and west again, back to district 23? how do we tell  as redrawn, it had what? 50.8 percent. and i gather that that's not considered a hispanic opportunity district because of lower voting turnout, registration, participation? how do we tell when something is being done to make it look like a hispanic district and, instead, when it's being done for the opportunity of providing a hispanic opportunity district if voter turnout and registration are increased?
well, this is 
what does a holistic reading mean? can you stay within the 
yes, that's fair, your honor, but that's not what i'm saying. i would  i would direct the court's attention to  to page 211 of the great-west opinion, note 1, where the court wrote that any equitable remedy under 502(a)(3) must  and i quote  be deemed to contain the limitations upon its availability that equity typically imposes. and my only point 
but that's true everywhere in the legal system, your honor. and i would also argue here that none of mr. tory's statements were defamatory. i would point 
for how long?
but the  but the evidence supporting them was perfectly admissible. so, the jury could consider that evidence and come to the same conclusion; it's just the label that seems to be giving you the most concern.
how are we supposed  what standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument? and, by that standard, how good is the argument?
well, which way is that  i mean, the fact that he tried six times and he wasn't there should have told the state this isn't working.
let's assume  let's assume that is true. what difference does that make to an analysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to take account of tribal sovereignty? the sovereign act is not selling gas, it's taxing. they are taxing. they're getting everything they want under their tax statute. where, then, is there a basis for a preemption 
what do we have in the record on that?
but his clever opponent would say  (laughter.)
ought not to get as much deference from the courts.
thank you, general clement. mr. lovell.
well, and i think  i mean, i'm  i think that some resistance by some parts of the university might be fine. i think if the recruiting office  this is the caveat i tried to give justice o'connor  if the recruiting office engages in conduct that effectively negates the access that they're providing, then i think you would have a different situation.
your honor, in 1945 during the height of the fair trade era the ftc did a study which concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was affected by fair trade. and the fair trade regime, remember, is a different and more extreme regime. there it was per se legality, not rule of reason. so it's just  there's just no basis for these assertions that somehow the economy is going to be massively changed. but it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. it will enhance its ability to compete and it will provide consumers more of what they want, and that is a good thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of cases it is conceivable that there can be anticompetitive effects.
the  the invention is a  it's  it's not a business method. it doesn't claim methods. it claims a system, an apparatus for an electric market for the sale of goods via a network.
 a lot.
no. first of all, what was being protected was this plan. the town had to fund its transfer station, a transfer station that it was going to take possession of less than two years after this court decided the case. so the protectionism that was going on there was really protection of their investment in their scheme.
legal fees. the disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public education for such child. what do you think that proves?
but in your view, if the consent was straightforward in the documents, would that be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?
it's one of the things that happens in this case. we have a stipulated record that is not very detailed, but in that instance there is only one violation.
what would, what would a satisfactory complaint for this party look like?
but they should have been arrested. i mean, so long as they should have been arrested, who cares? in this case, i mean, it'll  it'll be ultimately be tried by a jury i  i guess, but your  your client pulls up behind another car with wig-wag lights flashing, like a police car. right? he has a police scanner on the seat next to him. he has handcuffs. he has tinted glass in front of the license plate  of his license plate, so it can't be  can't be read. it seems to me there was obvious probable cause to  to arrest this fellow for impersonating a police officer. and i would have hoped he would have been arrested so he wouldn't go around and  and pull up behind another car. what is the problem?
yes, that's correct, your honor. what congress appears to have intended in this  in this statute, as  as much as anyone can tell, is that retroactivity decisions be  be litigated in cases that are brought under paragraph 6(1) which is those cases that are within a  a year of when the judgment of conviction became final. that's exactly what happened here. and the ross case that litigated the question of the retroactivity of richardson, that was a case brought under paragraph 6(1). mr. ross was within a year of when his judgment of conviction became final, and  and the issue of retroactivity was  was litigated straight and up in that case. and what it appears that congress intended was that very circumstance to happen in all cases, that the retroactivity of decisions of this court be litigated in cases brought within a year of finality, and then once those decisions were made, then litigants under paragraph 6(3) would have the opportunity to file when a court of appeals issued a retroactivity ruling. and then litigants under paragraph 8(2) would have a  the ability to file 
yes, it did.
as a matter of fact, justice stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a different way. we have special access and assistance squads that go to persons with physical challenges to get them off the vessel in an event of a  a need for evacuation. that's a different procedure than most passengers, but it's  it is one that is in place.
what do you say to the  sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent congress's regulation.
it's the same purpose. there's some place  they want people to move in  into the district here, for example, just like ohio wants businesses to move in.
i don't understand what happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of an antitrust suit. you're entitled to a jury trial in the antitrust suit, right?
that's what i thought. so the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.
 discovery? right?
yes.
i don't believe, your honor, that, that all that would be accomplished by that would be certainly not just delay. i think that if the court chooses to wait for the state's cert petition in nelson, the court could certainly put our cases aside and hold them awaiting nelson  nelson's cert petition should be filed by mid march  and then could make its judgment about whether to grant cert in nelson or not. if it granted cert in nelson it could decide the three cases together; if it found nelson raised no questions that were worthy of review, it could either proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the fifth circuit. i think that the state's decision, though, your honor, is based on a, a misreading of nelson. i think that the state has suggested to the court that nelson is in the state's phrase a narrow fact-based decision and i think that's not, i think that's not a fair characterization of the nelson 
if  if that is going to be your criterion, the  the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why  why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? because the  the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to  to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the ira category. you told us a few moments ago  and i'm sure you  you were right  that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. so if  if we say that the  the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. aren't we?
it's because it's a dog sniff.
well, you could, but i think the question  the question would be whether that product as a whole in the marketplace, which is  part of it is made up by this component. the argument would be, if i'm a competitor, i can't duplicate that product because that component is patented, and therefore, that product that contains the patented component should get the benefit of this market power presumption.
let's focus  [laughter.]
well, i have a question that is much along the same lines, whether this court must apply avena as the rule of decision, or perhaps say, "no, it does not have to do that." then you're left with looking at the treaty itself. and does that  can that take effect as american law?
well, i don't know the specific number. i would think that there are not many that the  that this  what you're concerned with primarily here are cruise ships that are in the business of providing public accommodations. but i would add as well  and i think this is very important that the court keep in mind  that the clear statement rule, as it's  as it's posited by respondent here, would not just apply to the ada. it would apply to all u.s. laws, and that would include title ii of the civil rights act of 1964 in its prohibition of racial discrimination, and i would find that that would be a remarkable construction.
right. we're not challenging the strike of 19 per se. what we're saying is that the prosecutor's reasons she gave for 19 are important in trying to determine whether she is intentionally discriminating in striking juror 16. and the fact that she is lumping the two jurors together, not treating them as individuals, but treating them, in fact, stereotypically by saying that all  that three of these reasons apply to both of them, when the record clearly shows that they don't apply to juror 19, it shows  it shows the discriminatory behavior. the  the attorney general said that this case is unlike miller-el, but i'd just like to emphasize certainly here we have a petitioner who was representing himself pro se and he did not present extra-record evidence of a  of a history of discrimination. but the case-specific evidence is similar to miller-el in important respects, and miller-el requires relief in this case. first  first of all, three of the reasons given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non-black jurors as to the black jurors, and that's youth, tolerance, and single. here, as in miller-el, we have the district attorney scrambling from rationale to rationale and, when called on, one of the reasons shifting to another. and here, the district attorney did not ask questions on grounds later used to justify the strike. now, clearly here, it's a judge-conducted voir dire, but the attorneys were allowed to ask the judge to ask different questions  to ask that the judge ask additional questions. and here, at the conclusion of the voir dire of jurors 1 through 17, the  the prosecutor asked the judge to ask four additional questions. three of them were to the panel generally and one specifically about juror 8. but the prosecutor never asked that any additional questions be asked of juror 16 before she struck her. if i could turn briefly to the state's jackson v. virginia argument, unless there's any additional questions on the batson claim. the state's claim that (d)(2) and (e)(1) incorporate the jackson sufficiency of the evidence test is contrary to the plain terms of (d)(2) and (e)(1) and this court's cases construing those provisions. and the state still hasn't cited a single case prescribing a jackson type of review, and courts have been construing aedpa for over 9 years now. that should be the end of the line for the state's argument.
that  that's the way i read it, and we  we discussed that in our brief, that  that word. we  we said more so that it doesn't take away from the position that we've got, but i  i agree with what you're saying. it could be each state. and  and the statute also says states, in the plural, in which they're located.
and do you  do you agree that that's right? and you said that that's their theory, that they could bring a 1983 action.
well, now, that  that definition, used or capable of being used  right, now. after one of the hurricanes, i saw a  a tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the gulf. what if somebody  some enterprising person had fitted that out like a  like a diner, you know, a  a restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're serving the meals off of this boat? now, the boat, apart from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland, is capable of being  still capable of being used. are the employees of that diner covered by the jones act?
well, but  but officers do make that call all the time. they make it in the context of terry stops. they make it in the context of lots of fourth amendment issues. in summers  in summers, the man was detained. in many of the post-summers cases, including many cited by the other side and the government, handcuffing is not viewed as routine. handcuffing is viewed as something that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure 
so that makes it a different case. it makes it very hard to say, well, the supreme court's already decided this matter.
your honor 
are you 
i like that. (laughter.)
thank you 
it  it was  i take it it was, in fact, not attached but it was somewhere on the premises.
no, we don't believe a demand letter would toll a statute, because it's not required by 
no. no, your honor. we 
yes. i agree with you. the federal circuit was ambiguous, in part because there were two separate decisions. the court considered the component issue in the eolas case and then when this case came along, said we've already decided the component portion of the statute; now we must decide the supplied from. so the language which the federal circuit used is a bit confusing. basically what it said, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the act of copying. that means that any, any company sending a machine or a patented product abroad, that that machine must be copied in order to be mass produced abroad. it might be a pill. it might be a mousetrap. it might be a buick. that exact identical copy if replicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the patent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.
if i understand your question, justice ginsburg, let me answer it this way. at&t has taken two positions. the most recent position is that it's the intangible object code, the series of 1's and 0's, or instructions to a computer switch to be on or off, that is a component. they also took a position earlier in the case and which is referred to in the stipulation that it was the golden master, the physical manifestation on the  on a master disk that went abroad that was the component.
 has to ask 
verdi wrote falstaff when he was 70  late  in his late 70's. it was his greatest creation. something.
congress was 
well, this court made clear in arizona v. hicks that it did not want to go down the road of creating something known as a quasi-search so that courts and police officers would be in the position of trying to determine whether or not something was a search or not.
no, but in 
again, i  this is a holdover from the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions process was followed, and again, it may be that had the tax court given it further consideration, they might have viewed that unnecessary. but we're not aware of that happening.
it was  it was explicit.
thank you, mr. peck. mr. frey, you have four minutes remaining.
he did. and he said he raised her pay up the maximum amount he was entitled to that year. and she didn't file a charge of discrimination in 1995.
yes.
well, suppose it were clear, from what the legislature said, that the only purpose of this legislation was to help out some local dealers who were politically powerful and the gasoline prices would go up. i assume you would be here defending the statute.
 reprimanded 
the constitutional obligation under 6 simmons itself would be to say is there something here or 7 in  in the words of justice o'connor, did the state put 8 future dangerousness in issue. and in this case 
how  how do you know 
but you did  you did get a judgment on the  whatever it was  the state franchises act, and that is not being contested 
mr.  mr. waxman.
 torts aren't covered 
maintaining bridges is one thing. you know, operating a for-profit activity would be something else.
why is that?
no.
and yet, their interests were cut out by the decision, and the court said that was okay.
you can raise it sua sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.
well, the two reasons why the statute fails to constitute a compelling government interest are the overbroad extension to ballot propositions, unlike the federal law and any other state law. and secondly, the underinclusiveness that this is a statute that is ostensibly intended to protect the integrity of the elections by ensuring that the funds that organizations spend for political electoral purposes represent the views of the people from whom those funds were derived. and the  what the state has chosen to regulate to advance that interest is solely people who already have the opportunity to prevent the use of their funds for purposes they disagree with, while not regulating at all other entities in which 
the  we would agree with you, justice breyer, but, in practice, many of these cases, the dispute is over the provision of experimental therapies for children with disabilities, particularly children with autism, where medically and educationally 
that is correct.
 it's cured 
i  i don't think that  that he is, your honor. however, the  a defense counsel would be, if this court were to announce a new rule  would be charged with the knowledge and, therefore, could i think correct any error that may have been made by the failure of the local officials or the national officials to inform the criminal defendant of his opportunity to contact the consulate.
well, that's too bad, that, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the building, it's going to be hard for you to bring the lawsuit. but we had, i thought, like, pages and pages of discovery rules and  i've never heard, before, of a lawyer who has a  you know, in this kind of situation, can't find out who owns a building there. there are records, there are all kinds of things.
 unless 
ms. 
kansas. their home is now in kansas. that's the nation. that's the place. and that  you've heard the language cited. and even though a person says, "you can live here as long as you want," that just means they can live there as long as they want; that doesn't mean it's the reservation. the reservation's sovereignty may have gone to kansas, though, of course, nobody had to move, unless he struck a fair bargain that he agreed to with the state of new york. i take it that's their argument. i just want to hear your response.
that has not been a problem that was reflected in the record either before the legislature or at trial. this is a facial challenge for the law, and you know, that situation of a primary candidate who, for whatever reason, felt that he or she needed to expend up to close to the expenditure limit  it wouldn't be very prudent, but that could be an issue. but, you know, we do not control independent expenditures under our law, and we certainly don't limit volunteer services. there's a tremendous amount of campaigning that can go on between a primary and a general election even with a limited amount of funds available.
and that's on page 6a on our appendix.
that's right, and they do that every day without imposing labeling requirements. imagine  imagine 
we do not need express language that expresses 
how is the government  how would the government do that?
well, if  if this under  the underlying claim seems to be that mr. cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this  this  your client wants tribute to go away. and you say, yes, but it's defamation. it's a defamation action. therefore, damages is the only remedy. is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?
i don't think that's true, your honor, because mamsi didn't move for summary judgment on an equitable theory. they moved for summary judgment on a contractual theory. and page 8 of their summary judgment motion is  is particularly clear on this. it makes clear that the contract creates, governs, and is the end all and be all of their rights.
mr. hungar, i'm curious. what happens if you have a new company that wasn't around when the regulation was issued? can it  can it bring a challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the statute?
i'm trying to get at the specific enforcement point. if you have one state that allows morphine to be used legally for 
 with the latter. i will say 
justice ginsburg, that is in fact what the judge did here. what the judge could do clearly under texas law is give any reasonable instruction to cure the error. what the judge couldn't do is submit a third special issue. it couldn't ask the jury, check, is there enough mitigating evidence to sentence to death. so it couldn't change the output from the jury. it couldn't add a new special issue but it could give any instruction possible to correct the error. that was texas law, that you could give instructions, but the special issues are set by statute.
you can 
i understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? for example, why not adopt it for the moses? the burden would be on the government to show that it was not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this context, that would be pretty easy. why not have the same test?
 does it refer at any point or in any circumstance to aedpa?
well, i think the difference is the  the judge in smalis was the trier of fact. he made a rule  he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver. he's decided that the evidence is insufficient. if that case goes up on appeal, that is  that is factual  that is oversight of his factual determination in essence.
what if he doesn't? one of his grievances is nobody told me. is he out of luck there? and i think there may well be situations in which prisoners don't have complete access to all the facts that go into a decision denying them medical care, for example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem and can't get the diet he wants, or something like that. but before he can sue, under your view if i understand it, he has to find out so he can name the people in his administrative complaint.
well, those doctors testified in the congressional hearings or in the eighth circuit or ninth circuit or the second circuit? there are so many doctors here. which are the two that you're referring to that do not dilate the cervix fully? did they testify in any of the district court cases?
well, what matters is whether there is a substantial disruption of what the school is trying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom lesson or a lesson on drug use.
fine, okay.
well, i think what's at stake is congress' intent in passing the one year. and it's fundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner timely file one claim and then potentially add an unlimited number of claims, no matter how different and  in time and type 
but even if it is, logically anterior to consideration of that procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the merits and the state court didn't make that merits. they thought there was no error. it is logically not necessary for them to decide whether an error is harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to say that they waive that, that later ground i would have thought would be very surprising. why do we remand these cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing further to be considered?
yes. of course, the prohibition we're attacking is against corporations 
your honor.
counsel, it's a good thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly. i would have thought your answer to justice alito would be, the statute says if it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or otherwise. and if it's remanded for a silly reason, that will be corrected on review of the state supreme court by this court.
no, sir. discrimination is not even in  is not even in title  rather, in 1982. so the language is very different 
 would you comment on the argument that  what will this do to compelling cigarette manufacturers to finance the advertisements against smoking?
you asked us to take that case and we didn't.
well, and again, i'm  i'm certainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this is a suit that should not be here. this is  this has had moving parts since we  since the petition was granted with the delaware supreme court ruling and now with yesterday's denial of reargument in the delaware supreme court. what 
well, certainly the plain-error argument is always, in a sense, available, your honor. but i do think this is an extreme case, and i think that's reflected by what the federal circuit said, that i read at the beginning of my argument. but that's extremely strong.
that's correct, justice kennedy. but to go back to the physical-presence question, justice souter, michigan is not now  michigan officials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula and all around the state to inspect wineries. the record is clear on that. what michigan does is require that wineries in michigan send samples and records to their offices. and the internet actually, if anything  the states say that the internet increases the danger, but the internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the states to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state presence. just as, justice stevens, the internet may make every speaker with a pc a town crier, as you said 
you've won here and the state is taking certiorari to the supreme court. don't worry about making a protective filing in the district court because, you know, if by chance the supreme court reverses, equitable tolling will apply. you know, you roll the dice with equity.
so  so in other words, they're saying that in this case  how could there not be prejudice? he had another trial. i mean  how could  i don't understand this from beginning to end then. but let me go back to my original question. what rule do you propose?
well, there may be a due process objection to that, but here the only objection 
but here, nothing 
yes, your honor. i  i misspoke if i  i conveyed the impression that they did not suggest that it was inadequate objection. i was merely suggesting that it wasn't inadequate in the sense that it was made at the wrong time, pretrial or at trial.
without more, justice kennedy, that inference cannot be drawn, and i'll give the court the example of the crips and the bloods 
the matter in which the cca posited that the jury could take it into account was the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can follow a nullification instruction and falsify our answers to the special issues in order to give effect to mitigating evidence. that was the exact same proposition that the cca had issued in its first opinion that this court summarily reversed.
but, as justice o'connor brought out earlier, all those cases  wickard, perez  they all involve a commercial enterprise. and, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.
well, our position is that by expressly conceding in their petition that it was timely, that that's an express waiver. i mean, they say that they would have  what they would have had to say was, "we know we have a limitations defense. we're expressly giving that up, that the proper standard is the intentional relinquishment of" 
of course, it seems to me fine, let section 3 apply. no problem so far with me. but that is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to worst. and now you're trying to narrow it to get out of that absurd result. well, so did the first circuit. that's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up in it. but that's  so  so what  that's why i think we're struggling with the words, and  and perhaps practically  if you mean by practically that it is not practically capable of navigation, even though it really is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long, long time and has connections to the land like jimmy's harborside probably or  or 
the criminal gene argument.
it was, your honor.
i don't think that's so hard to do. and you're right. we have to plead the theory, and  and the theory is 
all right, fine. then where do i look?
 then  i see that  then what's worrying me is this, that  one thing worrying me is that  let's take an ordinary buyer case. all right? and what happened is that the  some buyers would like to bring a fraud suit in federal court. they have to go to federal court now. they can't go into state court. but they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they say, "well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim, and we don't want to go into federal court, there surely are going to be a class of holders that would also have the kind of claim you say." so, there we are, same actions, all in the state court, just happens to have found a different class of claimant. and there always will be such a class.
thank you, ms. thompson. the case is submitted.
well, but that's excluding that  as i understand it 
 the mail.
but some of that you said was taken out by an approved transfer in 1798?
yes, your honor, that's correct. that's what the court speaks about in brookhart, and although we think that that's more of a guilty plea case than a trial strategy case, if this court were to go in that direction, that standard certainly could apply.
why?
 was a charge, "intended to kill a police officer." it could have been just "intended to kill." and i think mr. goldberg conceded that "intended to kill" would have been a proper conviction, but not "intended to kill a police officer" 
thank you, mr. wycoff. the case is submitted.
your honor, the sentence could have been run consecutively because of an aggravating factor. in fact, in this case the trial court judge, in fact, had three independent and separate reasons for running the sentence consecutively. two of those would be, i think we would say aggravating factors that the blakely reasoning would apply to. but the court of appeals when it considered this case only looked at the free crimes element to make that decision.
no, i am not agreeing that this was error at all. i agree that the prosecutor made a misstatement and that the california supreme court thoroughly and properly evaluated that statement 
that's correct, your honor.
yes.
so  but congress can't cure every problem that exists in the world, and this statute is fairly comprehensive.
but not solely.
a bond.
but you  you  justice breyer, you make a leap there.
no. they could at least come in if the defendant 
but you  you have 
right. i think the rule 2009 says, the federal rules of bankruptcy 
thank you counsel, the case is submitted.
thank you, mr. frederick. the case is submitted.
yes, i agree, your honor. and in merrell dow, the court held that in those middle cases 
we would like  first, when you have competition in ideals and in politics, it's always a continuing process, and they're hoping to win all these people over. they don't want these people to stay in other political parties, but they are opening it up because they have such a limited period of time in oklahoma when people can formally affiliate with the libertarian party or, for that matter, any newly recognized party. think of it this way. when counsel was talking about the rosario case where you  the  the state was allowed to have 8 to 11 months and the court found that was acceptable to change your registration or the older case of kusper v. pontikes where the court found that 23 months in  in advance to change your affiliation was too much, in oklahoma, whether it's 23 months before the newly affiliate party gets recognized or 8 to 11 months, you can't register with that party. so if it was unreasonable in kusper v. pontikes but was reasonable in rosario, the point is under either of those time periods, in oklahoma you can't register with a newly recognized political party. so how can that be reasonable? the libertarians do not have the opportunity. newly recognized parties under oklahoma law do not have the opportunity to get their people in in time, to the extent they could, as demonstrated in the record by states of similar population like kansas and arizona and, as i noted in the brief, oregon where there are substantially more 
well, your honor, i think you  we come back to the fact that he does not have a reasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocal control 
you say that, but that case doesn't say that.
can't  can't such a suit be brought in state court? i can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.
yes, justice kennedy, we do attack that finding as clearly erroneous. this case is really the flip side of easley v. cromartie because in this case latino voters supported republican and democratic candidates. as the state asserts vigorously, latino voters voted significantly and substantially 
so that if you charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake id cards, you think that would be a different case.
no. the 
is that before us on the questions presented?
no, our position would be no. that would have been an  inappropriate under the rationale of justice scalia.
well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere. the person who is arrested is not in a position to be making objective or subjective assessments, by and large. he probably knows what he's being arrested for because it's obvious, but then we have cases like this, which are the only ones that are going to be litigated, and he may not know. the  the fact still, it seems to me, is obvious. if we go your way, we're going to have to go the further step of requiring the cause to be stated. isn't that, as a matter of common sense, true?
wherein does it go further?
that's at sentencing after conviction.
it 
and then beyond that you say if that is found, then the jury has to find that the existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.
 so unusual about the facts 
well 
may i ask, if  if you know, whether congress has ever been asked to address this precise issue that we're debating today?
a recognition that the states have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate interest in regulating those corporations that it charters and that do business within its borders. and  and that that balance should be respected.
maybe elevate your  the microphone.
it might mean anything that is a 
which is zero. which is silence. there is no answer.
i don't think they got into that matter, justice stevens. instead, what they simply decided was whether or not the  the employer was an indian tribe. there was a question concerning some of the structures and just the business organizations that the indian tribes were using and 
no, but that  the problem with that is that a  the whole point of a relation-back rule is to get around a time bar. that's why you have them. and i thought your argument was, "well, you shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely new case." and so, that's why, it seems to me, your preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule, the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar. if you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an argument.
 the  the probate of a will requires determining that it has the appropriate formal prerequisites, which in most states is appropriate number of signatures that the testator was coherent, competent to make a will and that there was no undue influence.
well, i  i think it's a fair inference, justice scalia, from reading the historical precedent and the treatises that describe it. they  they describe these as, in  in a sense, second-class testimony. they say the problem with statements like this, if they're made even seconds after the event in place, is that they're  at that point they're nothing more than a narrative and require us to give credit to a statement  and this is the words the treatise writers used to use  that was not given under the ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of testimony. and when they used the word like testimony and they talk about the usual tests and the customary way of testing out-of-court statements, i think the fair inference is they're referring to the right to confrontation. perhaps another way to think about this is to take a step back and say, what if we decide that statements like this are not testimonial? the practical  the practical impact of that is not simply that these statements won't  will come in, but that prosecutors and  prosecutors, federal and state government, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever bring 911 callers into court. it  it is  across state hearsay law across the country, these are deemed excited utterances. so if this court were to say 
does your whole case turn on whether or not this is prejudicial to the fact-finding process on the specific issues or is there some more general standard?
 the test is going to be whether the manner, which may be difficult to recreate, caused  how much of a disruption it caused to the operations of the office.
so do i. (laughter.)
so you'll never really litigate in michigan how far they can go before they violate the rule.
the only purpose would be just what the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the smuggling operation.
gee, i  i really don't see what  what complaint you have then. any jury that  that thinks this person deserves mercy says, i think he deserves mercy, and that's  that's a  a mitigating circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating circumstances there are.
that's correct, mr. chief justice. we're not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons. the reason we're here is because of the circuit court's method in addressing this case and granting habeas relief.
no  no vested right to come into the united states. it is, in effect, a revocable 
but what the attorney  the attorney didn't say that won't work because it puts jurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to violate the oath. what the attorney said is, you can give no instructions. and the reason for that strategic choice is that smith's counsel made the judgment, i want it to be impossible for my client to be subject to the death penalty. had smith's counsel made the same objection that penry made, had he read penry right in front of him and asked, give me a deliberateness instruction, it would have cured the error. but the reason i would suggest that smith's counsel didn't is that the quantum of mitigating evidence in this case was so slight compared to the pervious cases that he made a very conscious strategic choice, i'd rather go all or nothing. i would rather make an argument that there is 
is it a regulatory taking in your view because the substantially advances test is not met, or is a regulatory taking and then i ask if it substantially advances?
oh, it's my  it's certainly my contention, justice stevens, that michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.
well, your honor, as a matter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation of property in guam, you look at the property in guam and then you have to take the tax valuation. you're taking the property that is subject to tax. we believe that this is the intent of congress also for two reasons, justice breyer, that addressed your issues before about one suggestion that guam could change this. the purpose of congress here was to set a meaningful debt limit. that is what real value appraisal value does. it is an economic determination of currency fact.
 pointing to, is that in one case he is making this statement as an employee; and you say the employer, if it's a stupid statement, ought to be able to fire him for it. in 
so, the question isn't 
so 
your honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in  in fact, for two reasons. first, once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing decision, albeit it not the one that was originally threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but there is a new one where that would have that consequence. in terms of bad consequences, i think the single biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of the opportunity for meaningful relief in ohio's courts. the layne decision in the last  decided just 2 years ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action about the way parole works in ohio. they were successful and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving 
we have no evidence either in the record before the court or congress as to how often that situation arises?
he was creating 
thank you, general clement. mr. atkinson. on behalf of respondents
that might be. in our case that is not the case here. what we use is a user fee. we have a limit. there's a limit to a user fee. we can 
if a prisoner filed a 1983 or bivens action, and the 
i'm not sure i understand that. i mean, we have not held, for example, that the fact of a prior conviction is something that has to be submitted to a jury under blakely. why, if you're determining that sentences run consecutively, isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous conviction and saying they're going to run consecutively?
well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this  of this crime.
i  no.
no. it's a compromise. just as my other example of a 50/50 chance of winning the lawsuit, you compromise for 50 percent. i don't see the difference.
justice stevens, we in the courts below agreed for purposes of the original source provision that there was a public disclosure. i think what's important following up on the question 
would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.
well, for one thing, it's absolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy. three people pleaded guilty, including 
it seems to me what you're  what you're saying is forget the 10 years. just do it every year.
there's no doubt in here that an invasion of the home was authorized by the warrant. right?
that's correct.
then why hasn't that been the effect on the federal ground.
oh, please.
the case is submitted.
this was  this was  for mr. fitzgerald and mr. vogler, they were challenging both the prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.
in other words, they are saying that the failure to object does not constitute  would constitute a procedural bar if we elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the failure to object to justify a higher standard of review on harmless error?
justice ginsburg, as  as i mentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. first, counsel's failure to  upon knowing of the importance of the blood evidence, which he clearly did because he raised  raised the issue himself, upon knowing of the photograph showing the missing blood, he failed to go forward and basically do what we did in federal court, which was hire an expert to look at the results of the fbi testing and to determine whether there was a viable defense  a viable defense strategy available there, which he did not. also, if we look at the record in this case, we have a situation where trial counsel also pointed toward hubert muncey, jr. as the actual perpetrator of this crime. he actually called the sister of the victim to say that his sister was afraid of mr. muncey and that she had plans to leave him. when we look at what was available to trial counsel there, we see five witnesses, many of whom were friends of mr. muncey, who presented evidence that showed that on the night of ms. muncey's murder, mr. muncey and ms. muncey had a fight at the c&c recreation center, that ms. muncey went home, that mr. muncey followed her there, that he confessed that when he returned home, he was angry and drunk, that they began to argue again, that he struck her in the head, that she fell, that he checked her lifeless body and found she was dead, and that he hid her body in the bushes.
well, i understand.
because of the threat of treble damages 
and, your honor, the maryland case law adopts a traditional rule for administrative proceedings. we cite the case, in page 18 of the red brief. importantly, though, what petitioners 
and  and (d)(2)(d) says the court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a supreme court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed. that didn't happen.
so what's your definition?
and the respondent had months after that disqualification was made clear and the court of appeals denied mandamus to retain a different counsel if he chose to retain a different counsel. there's no showing in this record that the respondent didn't consult with the lawyer who was disqualified and with the lawyer who he elected to have represent him at trial and not determine that that was in his best interest at that time.
we  we made a decision in petitioning the court that the liberty interest issue was something that we would not raise. we raised it on appeal through the district court and through the circuit court. we chose not to raise it here to focus on the due process issue.
i have a more basic question, whether we had a case or controversy to start with. this is kind of an intramural dispute between two guamanian officials about what guam's position should be with respect to the organic act and i'm wondering why that's a justiciable controversy under article iii. the cases you cited in your petition all involved on its  only facially intra  interbranch disputes within the federal government; but the agencies in those cases always  were representing a real party in interest. united states versus icc, the icc was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled. why shouldn't we just let guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we'll have a case or controversy.
but on the other side, state courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with chapman because when it goes over into the federal court they're going to apply brecht.
all right. well, then i'm going to stop asking 
but the instructions for use of the special verdict form would not have been. and  and it's because of that  that quirk in washington law  and the state offered us some suggestion of why that quirk exists. the deadly weapon provisions have been a part of the washington sentencing scheme since its enactment in the mid-'80's. it was only about 10 years later that the additional enhancements for firearm were added, and  and they were enacted by  by a citizens initiative. and there's very little reference between the two of them. but they still exist together because there's nothing that suggests, again, that the state couldn't allege the lesser offense even where a handgun is  is involved because it is the difference between a handgun with nothing more and a handgun that has the capacity to fire. and it's that additional component of capacity to fire that truly creates the greater and lesser offense in this case.
that's right, and that's why i'm suggesting if it really is a question of strategy, you don't even need implicit consent.
the court has not held that. instead, it has 
in other words, it was an improperly removed case.
 on us, wouldn't it?
yeah, but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition. there wasn't conspiracy that affected interbrand competition.
 four reasons for that.
clearly the state of texas approved of the monument being on the grounds 
and the reason that it's happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four trolleys. (laughter.)
in this case, the levy was an involuntary act on the part of the government to take the money from ec trust, from the deposit that was put up.
thank you, mr. dwyer. mr. dreeben.
general, do you understand the scope of this statute to be different than the scope of the statute at issue in stenberg, focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional language?
the hypothetical sounds ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of segura, that  that it was somehow a retroactive validation.
well, not by you.
i mean, do people say, "oh, they've got me now. i won't get rid of the drugs"?
 of these plants.
but do you agree that if they're right on the interpretation of 1367, the judgment has to be reversed?
rococo i think.
mr. marcus, i was kind of interested in your calling this an incentive program. is there any  there are no intermediate stages. it's an all-or-nothing incentive, isn't it?
you think it's unnecessary to decide this case.
i don't 
no, because the purpose is to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the world today, there are an awful lot of houses where nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way for them to go to the post office without giving up a certain amount of work. and so they say, forget it. if it comes from the lands division or something, who cares? now, that  i don't know how you'd know how many there are like that, but it's a question of reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.
now, you want us to apply a presumption that a petition is timely if it's filed within 60 days. but california doesn't apply such a presumption, does it?
 that was burglarized?
improper denial of jail credit, making  improper denial of jail credit.
correct.
all right.
the only problem is, it doesn't say that.
but compared to what? you haven't fully stated what you would replace the automatic new trial with. and you said  you started to say something about if the defendant could show that his preferred counsel would have pursued a different strategy. is that it? or would he have to go beyond that and show that that different strategy would have a greater chance of success than the strategy that was in fact pursued?
 rather than playing hide the ball.
i agree. so how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.
would the magistrate keep those grounds secret?
 sentencing factors 
well, then it doesn't matter as far as the medicaid funds are concerned. it comes out of general state revenues. right?
i know it's difficult. what's your answer?
i would always  i think the standard i was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the sg says. and i think he says that  that  that justice alito's point, which is certainly a good point, is that you would have to allege facts such that it was clear from the face of the complaint that you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was  that's what he means by protected  and there's an ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out of this conduct that is arguably okay.
but you're  you're basing your argument on this statute.
i would imagine that it would cut both ways in many cases, your honor. i'm sorry, i can't speak to it more specifically than that.
well, but is  is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than  than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?
now, wait. what  what is the basis on which you assert these regulations are applicable to you 
wow.
certainly that would be fine.
okay.
yes, adequate  basically, indicia of reliability. it didn't go into  it didn't go into too much more detail than that. it just simply required that, a witness under ten, the court must find that the, that the statement is reliable and the statements are reliable, and then 
that's  that's true. the parties have discussed many cases. almost all of them have some factors similar to the circumstances here, and as we've argued, all of them have distinguishing factors too.
well, normally if you are allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you can serve a party and then you have three days to file with the court as part of the civil rules. i sort of think that's what the judge  because this was going out by mail  he probably didn't get  i wish i would have saved the envelope, but i don't have the envelope, but it probably didn't get to my office for three days anyway.
is this happening under the new policy?
it can't guarantee results, but couldn't they at least start with a, i don't know how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to produce less rather than more, and hence come within the safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?
that number would be the number that shows latinos have the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice. it will be a different number for each district, but it would always be in the evidence of the case because the analysis is done on different districts. here, all of the experts agreed that district 23 had been created so that it would not elect a latino candidate of choice, but that the state testified that it wanted to keep it voting age majority, that they did so because they wanted henry bonilla to run from a latino majority district. the state abandoned traditional redistricting criteria to do so, redistricting at the bloc level and splitting 6 election precincts out of 51 in webb county, which is wholly unnecessary even to equalize population in either district. there is no reason for the state 
yes.
wasn't it the case that those 13 experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for 14 mitigation purposes? they were hired in connection with 15 the possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number 16 one, that he was insane at the time he committed the 17 crime, in which case what he was when he was a child would 18 be irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently 19 incompetent to stand trial. so they were asked 20 specifically to inquire into his present mental situation, 21 and their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the 22 trial. so that's the instruction. naturally they  what 23  why are we engaging you? we're engaging you to tell us 24 do we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a 25 basis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.
i'm not quite sure if this works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an opportunity for counsel to object. there isn't an opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment official comes down. now, i guess you could move to quash.
but you've already conceded that it  washington law doesn't require the officer on the spot to say why he's making the arrest and that there's no decision of this court or any court that i know that said the constitution requires the officer on the spot to give a reason.
okay, and yours is the interstate fee.
i mean, there must be some criterion. there are many people of mixed blood.
but that's 
i would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure. it talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of the allegations. so i would assume that's the important linkage.
yes, exactly.
you call that fopa? that's the name of the statute? (laughter.)
the statute, of course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries. how common is the vertex delivery in the d&x?
because of an ameliorating amendment to the death penalty statute?
give me another way.
well, it has the same guideline punishment. it has the same treatment as the unlawful entry. and they're treated  we have case law in our circuit that says, i think it is corrales beltran, that says the attempt is a substantive offense, even though it sounds contradictory.
it doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.
wasn't there also mitigating evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth, which is analogous to what was involved at least  well in both of these cases?
 the context in which this law developed. it developed, originally  if you were a public employee, you did not have free-speech rights as a citizen. as justice holmes said, you know, you might have the right to speak, but you don't have the right to be a policeman. so, the "as a citizen" part didn't come out of happenstance.
 does the government have a position on that, whether you can combine a suit against the united states under the tort claims act with a suit against the individual officers under bivens.
will it also satisfy the text of the constitution that says no warrant shall issue except upon probable cause? and i'm asking you why is it not adequate probable cause to say we believe that will probably happen when the anticipatory event occurs?
thank you, counsel. general rowe?
which  california hasn't had it since 1983, right?
 it's facial discrimination.
but that critical test is being applied to an agency which is being identified by reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, correct?
i don't know, i'd be worried  you know, bust in somebody's door  that the homeowner wouldn't shoot me. without announcing that i'm the police, he had every reason to believe he's under attack. isn't that a considerable deterrent?
well, what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits?
i understand.
 simply showing on its face that there's either an absolute statute or that one of the exceptions to the statute exists?
so, it's really 
but by contrast 
well, why can't they do that, which is just what wood says they can do, if anybody, you know, thinks that's valid? but the  what's the problem then? because i would have thought that the reason this case appears difficult is because yours is a case where the ag should be able to come in and remove it.
no. from the time of, i suppose the pertinent question would be from the time of final state, final state judgment, eventual filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our disposition? presumably, probably five or six months?
yes, it can arise again and  and will many times arise again because consider someone who's already had his or her aedpa year pass and then discovers, say, a brady claim and wants to go back and litigate that. under aedpa, you would have a year to get back into court with that.
all right. then  then it has no significance ever because the  the state has an obligation to use the best address it has, whether he's got an obligation to  to keep the address updated or not. and  and this is the  the tough point for me with your case. it seems to me that your case depends on our saying the obligation to keep the  the address current has absolutely no significance.
 to the answer you gave about apportionment because i wasn't quite sure i understood the answer. you said, well, apportionment is very difficult. what are you supposed to do? what are you  what's the base? well, and you said, should we apportion against  between in-state and out-of-state, and i would think the answer is yes. that's the whole point.
because  because what he's  well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.
and in the year 2005, i want not to have the  what are they called? the 1998 guidelines. i don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the constitution of the united states.
would such be  of such expenditures or revenues. that refers back to local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues. it's referring you back not to the totality of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.
but this court's precedents indicate, justice breyer, that the indigents do have a significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.
the  yes, the ambiguity arises because what the treaty means is that if you were to extract the dmt and then add it to something, which can't be done here and could have no religious meaning for the udv, and we're not even sure if  chemically, if it's possible. if you were to extract it and then add it, then you would have a solution containing dmt. and that's 
well, it was a compound question, but i'll try to answer each of its parts. the first point i would make is that bazemore came after evans and hazelwood and ricks, and it did not distinguish evans or hazelwood or ricks on the grounds that bazemore is a pay case and hazelwood and evans were not pay cases. it distinguished them on the grounds of whether or not the alleged discrimination was taking place in the charge filing period. so this notion that bazemore stands as a proposition that evans and lorance and that line of cases doesn't apply because they don't apply to pay cases was not the opinion of the court in bazemore. secondly, we are not asking you, and i don't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule that we are proposing in this case. we are proposing the same rule that's set forth in justice stevens' opinion for the court in evans, the same rule that's set forth in justice powell's opinion in ricks, the same rule that's set forward in justice scalia's opinion for the court in lorance.
but where is the line? that's what i'm trying to get at. if it's  if the rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable inference of innocence and you take into account the strength of a prosecution's case in making that determination, you don't just accept the defense evidence and  and see whether  how  how strong an inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed. i mean, where is the line?
here, it seems that the prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or  or certainly was not extremely clear.
excuse me. is that how we apply statutes, that if they may plausibly be read a certain way, that's what they mean?
well, the  the real problems that the trial court had and what we would continue to espouse with this opinion is that it doesn't link the loss with the misrepresentation. and in this case, the misrepresentation offered occurred 9 months after the price drop that is being sought. i think when you  when you carve it all back and you look at what the real issue is, at the end of the day, it's  it becomes an issue of what  what damages does the plaintiffs' class seek.
the prosecutor objected to none of this evidence. and, in fact, the prosecutor, in closing statement, argued that the  not only could the jurors consider belmontes' forward-looking prospects, but the jurors should consider those prospects. so, in this case what we have 
but consciousness, i mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but i don't know that that would help you.
 helping its members?
that is correct. and that is why this court, in construing this right, in the context of what i think is probably the most critical aspect of the right, once you have a lawyer in the criminal justice system, namely the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the court has looked to the impact on the fairness of the trial. now, this court 
so overall, if  looking at this  and that's why i think the question about the weight to give to the fact finding is important. you think  you have a theory under which he could have done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion. but also you think, my goodness, if he did it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek  you know, there's nothing else in the record that suggests he would plot in that way to do this. nothing. the husband is away at the time from the dance. he could have done it. they are fighting. they could have done it. and if the luring theory correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical evidence is from the husband, not from him. so the jury is brought into this on a theory that there is a sexual attack and the one  by the defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved pretty much is that. and now we have two experts, dr. blake and dr. bigbee. and reading a page, which i hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, i'd say they might disagree. they might disagree. and it's just not conclusive. so if you're sitting there, do you have to have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong evidence for both people? and  and the part that's bothering me  i  i see what that district judge said on that one point, which he may have thought was peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about when the blood spilled. but if you look to the underlying thing and i think, well, maybe you're right, but maybe you're not right. and so how do  how do i  how do i do this? what's the  what's the weighing? i sit there and think, my goodness, i don't know who committed this crime if i'd been on that jury. and could  could a person sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion, my goodness, i know?
well, let me ask you another question related. suppose  this is an individual action. these are individual actions. they're not class actions.
 court.
if they don't  if they can't ask him  i mean, i assume many foreign nationals are detained fairly close to the border, and if you start saying, well, my first question is, are you a citizen or not, you've got to give miranda warnings first saying you don't have to answer any question that might incriminate you.
thank you, mr. dreeben. mr. goldstein.
have you been able to think of one?
because he didn't bring that case. sure, there are dozens of constitutional claims he could have brought that would have satisfied 2253. he didn't bring those claims. so that's not presented by that proceeding. he's not entitled, in his reply brief, to say, "well, you know, we could have brought this constitutional claim," given that he did not, in fact, bring that  this constitutional claim. if medellin's theory is adopted, it would embrace a standard beyond fay versus noia. thank you.
yes, it is, in this case, if her intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the 
what happens when a sentence is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater risk of infringing the main purpose of the sentencing reform act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities; and in contrast to a sentence within the range which does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a sentence outside the range may well. it's different from what the sentencing commission with its expertise and its experience has recommended as the appropriate sentence, given those facts.
it  from the moment  the petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased  it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays under protest, that it is entitled to those royalties back.
justice souter, of course the presumption would be that people on the capitol grounds would assume the state of texas wanted those monuments on the capitol grounds.
 3 years.
okay. you think that the  21 the vacatur here could be a fact, but then you say that 22 even so, the petitioner didn't go back to state court 23 diligently and on a timely basis.
except that the  what was it, the rogers case, which said that the  well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant. the basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. so if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.
but stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statute's been changed.
i want to know that he thinks he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, rat fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him. all right? so he needs to know whether  what it is that  that this board is considering before he can come in and explain what it isn't true. he doesn't have to have all the evidence. he has to know what the point is, what the charge is, what the claim is. and you're saying he gets it because he has the report. is there an example in the record of a report?
so in  in other words, you  you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, going back to justice breyer's 
okay. in the case of the steam shovel operator on the dredge, do we say that  that he contributes toward that function because it can't move unless he dredges first, so that the  the whole object of moving across the harbor to dredge includes the  the dredging part?
yes, your honor, and then supply whatever remedy would be appropriate. and again, that  that's a call upon the judiciary to remedy treaty violations, and  and that's been 
if it was a question, yes.
possibly 
it was  it was before the court by way of that motion. it was not properly in the record. but then again, it was not any more proper to consider after its opinion than it was to consider before it 
well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference. the difference with the rule you are advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time a with your first case, is going to have to guess whether it is in this case or not in this case necessarily related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.
well, let me cite another case then, the adams case from the eleventh circuit.
yes, your honor. it 
well, because there has been no case that really did not involve something that could reasonably be called property.
precisely did not.
justice breyer, i disagree with the premise of that thought. congress in section 7433 did provide what i would like to call a federal private right of action. it's an action by a private party against the government, not another private party, for damages in the event the government violates federal law in the tax collection process. what congress did not do  and the solicitor general concedes it did not do  is create a federal private right of action for quiet title claims in disputes between two private parties.
those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of.
that was one option. he could have continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow him off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have stopped a pursuit and let him go which often happens in many pursuits.
pursuant to the reversal of the 
i  i think the  waterman has a  has a good summary of the  of the limits. i think even the two cases on which the respondent principally rely, sutton and o'callaghan, lay out the proper scope of the rule. those  both of those cases involved a claim that depended on having a will that had been probated declared invalid, and that is within the narrow confines of the exception. but it is a will-specific rule. the  and, justice stevens, back to your question. the one thing about markham is that there's no general interference principle, and that's where the 
why not?
the answer would be yes, you do. you do have to, and then if there's some other authority that wants to get involved in this, the two authorities would work it out.
what i'm saying is that it wasn't risky, your honor, because the  this jury was willing to consider an alternative defense that would have otherwise appeared as a concession. they did not take it as a concession.
it would be difficult to do administratively. but  just because of the cost of collecting all the 
all right. i think if a parole officer said, "you must consent to this search" 
and  and the question we have here is when the  when and if the united states, pursuant to this statute, decides no longer to suffer the aliens being at large, but instead return them to the border, in effect, or return them to detention, this statute makes clear that that  that whatever practical experience they have had at large in the country is always subject to revocation 
as we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13. instruction 13 used the word direct.
well, i understand the historical fact, but i'm  i'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?
but the 
it applies  it applies to state prisons, as well, because of its spending 
the first amendment value may be the same, but it  but what is present is another value. and unless the person is going to go public, in which case the balancing occurs, and assuming there's no prohibition of it, that other value is a very significant one, the ability of public officials to run their offices.
there aren't too many cases that fit this.
well, you're into your backup argument now.
justice ginsburg, the situation in williams, however, involved the tax lien. mrs. williams would not have paid the tax had the government not asserted the tax lien and forced her to pay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was sold. it was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense that i'm talking about.
well, i suppose the suggestion i made 
well, let  let me ask 
i think you want a better reason for a sentence that is farther away from some mean.
but that was for an  an arrest in which, so far as we can tell, the  the stated grounds for the arrest were those for which there was probable cause. and i think one of the concerns underlying the argument that i asked you to comment on is that if the  if the police, in effect, have  have discretion ad lib afterwards to come up with new grounds for the arrest, there's  there's going to be a kind of a basic corrosion in the integrity of the arrest process and in the confidence of people to believe that the police are really acting in good faith when they make an arrest.
 a reasonable juror to find 
or to, or to put it another way, to put justice ginsburg's point another way, every executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied challenge to an expenditure statute. because the only way the statute is applied is through executive action. and whenever the executive spends the funds improperly, you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general statute or a  or a single shot statute.
well, assume one that just gets over the line.
isn't there  isn't it  you  you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting instead of as the very first redistricting done by a legislature.
i 
michigan plaintiff against iowa defendant, necessary party, michigan defendant, rule 19. now we bring him in. and you're saying before this statute, not going to come in because it will wreck jurisdiction. right?
well, but wait. wait. wait. it says to furnish such communications service, is what (a) says. and they don't furnish such communications service to your client.
that's correct, your honor, but the difficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least restrictive alternative test is  is the possibility, as this court noted in turner, that every judgment every day is subject to some court somewhere finding that there was a less restrictive way of achieving the goal. and  and we see that 
thank you, general kline. ms. woodman.
 revoked.
mr. chief justice, the  the state was effectively notified when the mandate did not issue.
well 
i had never thought of construing the 
and my answer to that, your honor, is that it goes  it stems from the rationale expressed in pennsylvania coal for allowing the government to interfere with private property 
it's in the record, yes, your honor.
you haven't been injured until you've exhausted your 
the factual claims 
but if the fourth circuit is wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the case for your side.
well, in this 
give us an example of the difference between the two.
it might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but mr. halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate. and nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.
the thought just occurs to me and i  frankly, with all the briefs we've had, i feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. but it seems to me a great difference might turn on what exactly the injunction provided. some injunctions must be  might be much more burdensome than some others. if they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.
okay.
well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why i asked. i just don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical where a new jersey wholesaler has all of the  you know, the physical facilities and so forth that the new york wholesaler does.
well, certainly matthews v. eldridge.
oh, but can i respond to that specifically?
but that  it's not it never happened as though the federal employee was off in hong kong. he was there on the premises. he is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority. it seems like it's a question of phraseology that you're dealing with.
and  and i  i think that, as  as i hope may blend the answers to both questions. i think that 
no. in between, they didn't  they didn't change the price. they didn't get involved in the price. then they came up with their program and then they instructed the joint venture to make the prices the same.
and that's what you're asserting is the case here.
i'm sorry 
that is the  well, it is printed on that. but i mean, if you look at the original document 
the  the injury is twofold, your honor. and  and first, it is the fact that by them not voting in the primary to which they have associated  and that is registering as a republican or a democrat  if they go to the polling place and at the last minute decide to go and vote in the libertarian party primary, their decision not to vote in the republican primaries, when candidates have been trying to  to use voter lists trying to get to their party members to vote 
it does extend to questions of law. the problem, of course, is that the state court question of law that was decided was whether our  we were entitled to compensation under state compensation law. the state court did not decide whether we were entitled to just compensation under the fifth amendment.
well, i don't understand your answer then. i mean  i mean, does the fact that  that there was classic mob violence involved make a difference or not?
well, justice stevens  i mean, excuse me, justice scalia, things have changed, in the sense, first of all, that in those days there was a common law writ of trespass. if one were to file, in michigan, a complaint for trespass against the sheriff, one would be laughed out of court today, because all that you have is a tort suit, which you have to show an extreme violation  i cited the michigan statute that requires extreme recklessness on the part of the police officer. the second point is that in those days the sheriffs were  there were adequate means to control the behavior of sheriffs, because they were seen as arms of the judiciary. that, of course, was before the rise of the independent police forces that we have today. and so, the exclusionary rule, of course, was adopted in the late 1800s, early 1900s  in part, in response to the changing circumstances of the police. the police were no longer under the direct control of the judiciary; and so, different remedies were necessary in order to assure compliance with constitutional rights.
could you just replay the order of the proceedings? the first petition is to the state court. was the defendant in that first state habeas represented by counsel?
yes, they do, your honor, and i would like to address that. the two largest states of inmate population, california and texas, together comprise about 300,000 inmates, which is about 20 percent of the total inmate prison population in the united states, including the bureau of prisons. those two states have a similar policy. in addition, oklahoma 
i  i think the effect could be different when you raise it. i think there can also be a difference in effect in how it will be treated, even if it was promptly raised. i think, for example, on a 12(b)(1) motion, i don't believe the  the court is obligated to accept all the plaintiff's pleadings. it's allowed to look outside the pleadings to actually determine the jurisdiction. whereas, in a 12(b)(6) motion, if the plaintiff says it's an indian tribe, it's an indian tribe.
well, his argument at state court was not that he didn't investigate that; his argument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could have presented that through some other witnesses. the  his argument at the trial  at the post-conviction 
well, the prejudice in this case is that the standards of rule 15 were not considered; but, in addition, there are  there are well-recognized decisions, both from this court and from the courts of appeals, that went  that says a judge may deny leave to amend when the  at the time the concession is made. and the answer  the state had full information. and the state admits here that it had all the information it needed to make the limitations calculation attached to its answer, in which it conceded timeliness, and then  but then waited a year, or several months, to bring it up later. and so, we would argue, if this were a rule 15 analysis, that it would not be appropriate for the court to allow the amendment.
well, then  but your focus  in response to my question about what would constitute release, you focused on the fact of impoundment, a restriction of the flow. it seems to me that the ladle analogy that the court has made part of the law of the land is  refutes that, because if it's hold  you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like an impoundment. you've separated it, to that extent, from the other body, and the court said, when you pour it back in, that's not 
well, your honor.
no, i do not think in this context it would. i think there needs to be something more specific. we're really talking about declaring rights here and not providing a specific remedy. and this court has always taken the view that the claims court jurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money damages.
thank you, counsel. mr. schaerr, we'll hear now from you.
not as a surrogate, justice ginsburg. the  the fact of the matter is that wrongdoers act in a variety of ways.
 feldman, do you agree that the state had the burden of proving voluntariness at the second stage?
any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.
thank you. mr. tribe.
very well, mr. browning. mr. hurt, we'll hear  we'll hear from you.
i know that's your position, but has any judge so ruled in this case?
that certainly highlights why this is an sec case and not an antitrust case, it seems to me, because that  disclosure is for this administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments. that was the problem the court faced in nasd and it was the problem the court faced in gordon.
no, i'd  no, your 
again, i would take issue with that and say the primary concern that madison was focused on was the taking of the money and then giving it to the outside religious entity.
why  why is this an easy case? because, after all, the first circuit is struggling with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use section 3. that's fine. but you know that the garage door is not a vessel, and you also know that jimmy's harborside is not a vessel. and you also know that justice scalia's beached scow or something is not a vessel. and i take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and one day they take it out to sea and  because they want to move it across the harbor. i guess that isn't a vessel. is it? or maybe it is. so why is this so easy? because the first circuit 
we  we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement. all we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released. that's all we can tell.
yes, your honor.
because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.
mr. minear, could i go back to glacier 
you'd say, well, if they  if they send the  the notice to the last address they had, or if they send it  since we're talking about real estate, maybe if they send it to the  to the property, nothing wrong with that. so that's kind of a wash.
there  there are two parts in my mind to this. the question is what is the difference between a workmen's  worker compensation and health benefits. i agree with you, so far tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the nature of the contract providing the benefit. now, i know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that to the side. if it doesn't depend on that, it depends on the difference between workers' compensation and health benefits. and you want to say there isn't enough of a difference there, though they argued the mandate makes a difference. of course, you could mandate health benefits too, and i don't think that would matter. but if you're right, what about a  a long-term contract for bottled water for the workers?
that's correct.
what is very different is that this is the prosecutorial function. as this court recognized in armstrong, that is a core executive branch function and it is one that the courts are ill-suited to second-guess because a whole variety of determinations can enter into whether to prosecute somebody, whether they  whether the particular conduct  how culpable the person is, whether the conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities, whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what  what the office's resources are. there are a whole bunch of  of judgments that courts are ill-suited to second-guess, and it would be very chilling if the prosecutor had to 
so the jury must have found that forensic evidence to be very convincing.
it was the stop of the cars in that case that caused the result.
that's correct.
very well, mr. cole. mr. freedman, we'll hear from you.
well, the united states claims no, your honor, of course. but when we look back at the experience of the states with rfra, before it was declared unconstitutional, we presented substantial evidence in the  in the joint appendix with regard to the way in which there was an explosion of demands for accommodations by prisoners from previously unheard of religions. there was an expansion  an explosion of claims of conversion within 
right. what i'm trying to say is in the previous chapter 7 case we lacked standing to object to those claims and that in the new chapter 13 case the court took the chapter 7 case claims and said, you're bound by these in the new chapter 13 case.
ms. blatt, can i ask  there's no discussion  legislative history in the briefs that i  because i  that i recall. is it true that the people voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the amendment before them? did they have a committee report on it explaining that it still applied to the  that the  that the "notwithstanding" clause in 1091(a) would still be in effect?
thank you, general. mr. studebaker, we'll hear now from you.
we do, however.
yes, justice ginsburg. the  the figure, which comes from the tsann kuen case out of arkansas supreme court, is that there are 18,000 tax delinquent parcels certified every year in arkansas. but what we do know is that 85 percent of tax delinquent properties in arkansas are redeemed by the owner either before the tax sale or within 30 days after. so we don't know how many notices came back unclaimed after the first attempt.
i'm trying to think. it seems if you  it ought to work out similarly to what happens in a case where there's a federal issue that you remove under. now you've removed. and there also is a state issue pendent. now, what the judge does is he says, defendant, you win on the federal issue, and i'm going to send this thing back now, remand it, because i don't think i want to maintain here the state issue. and so it's a remand order. the case is remanded. now, i think you get an appeal on your federal issue there. and then  then why shouldn't  if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?
correct, your honor. the  the question  i think the difference is that the concept of complete diversity, which this court for 200 years has articulated as in the statute that grants diversity jurisdiction is a relational concept. in order to determine whether you have jurisdiction over any parties in a case, you must look at all of the parties in the case. with regard to amount in controversy, it's perfectly clear, and  and 1367 changes nothing about the fact that 1332 jurisdiction requires meeting the amount in controversy. but if 1367 has conferred, as it has, supplemental, additional jurisdiction, then the question that has to be asked is, does the fact that a party coming in with what is otherwise a supplemental claim  does  does the presence of that party destroy the original jurisdiction that exists where the new party coming in is diverse but doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount?
but i think justice ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act.
would we have to  would we have to reverse in part rose against lundy to go with your view?
well, the prosecutor would be absolutely immune, of course.
under our standard, it would be 
all right.
but your  but your point  your  whatever the internal grievance procedure is, there's no judge that would decide that, which you said, this is all for the internal procedure.
but here not only, not only does it say that the attorney general's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no mention about remand in relation to a case that is removed after the attorney general's certification. whereas by contrast, where the attorney general doesn't certify and the case is removed, the statute does address the issue of remand. so if you put those two things together, isn't it perfectly clear that congress did not want these cases that are removed on the attorney general's certification to be remanded?
no, there are  there are still property tax  some of the respondents that are still in the case are property taxpayers. kim's auto 
justice scalia, flanagan held that there was no collateral order appeal. it didn't address the mandamus question.
 that  that should not  that should not be a  a selection criterion in itself, but it 
i  i agree.
thank you, counsel. mr. shorr.
do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?
so i'm  my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?
the purposes that  the purposes for which the  that are being excluded in that case are a wide variety of different kinds of speech and non-speech activities, not only political speech but public relations. many courts have interpreted organizing activities to be non-germane to collective bargaining. membership benefits that are not available, non-members are put in that category. donations to charities. international activities. there's a whole variety of union expenditures that the courts have held are not germane to collective bargaining and cannot be charged over a non-member's objection, and a state would be perfectly free, as several states like pennsylvania and new mexico have, to say our judgment is that our interest in labor peace does not extend further than in authorizing an agency fee that includes purposes germane to collective bargaining.
have there been courts that have held the contrary? have there been courts that said when somebody wasn't notified and they sought to obtain some remedy for that, that even though the treaty has been violated, you have no remedy under our system?
and have they asked for it? has any party asked for a jury trial? if not, that part of the case seems academic.
and they can  and presumably they act accordingly at the polls. if they think someone has been bought, i assume they don't reelect the person.
getting back  is ineffective assistance sufficient? yes.
 in reno versus aclu 
well, i mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in  in the plea waiver situation? i mean, we  the  the classic point of it all is the knowing  the  the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right. and leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, i don't see that there would be  have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process. you indeed, dispute it.
the prior owner did assign it. the stopper was the blm.
i'm kind of curious what your answer is to the chief justice's question. (laughter.)
correct.
why is it a wholly state law claim if the principal matter is whether this federal employee is immune from suit? that's the threshold question that has to be answered. it's determined wholly by federal law, so you must get through that federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit.
but i'm curious 
well 
rather than have her  her voice on the telephone call 
this court has not read tinker quite so broadly in both frazier and in kuhlmeier, and there are a couple of aspects of tinker that i think are worthy of note. one, that there was no written policy there, so there was an issue of standardless discretion being exercised. and also 
and in the  in a  in a specific performance contract action, you sue the person.
in this case 
it happens every  every 86 years they have one of these storms. (laughter.)
he doesn't have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.
and why was that?
i  i think in  in a proper case  and i don't think you do it under the  under the public interest analysis. i think you'd probably end up doing it under the balance of the hardships. but in any event  and  and what you  you know, obviously, this case is  is more complicated because 
i'm not aware of any cases where that has succeeded except at the circuit court level 
right. well, there are a few points, both legal and practical. on the legal, until 1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no limitations period ever applies against the government. and that's the reason for the strict construction canon, that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies, and thereby bars the government from forcing the law in the public interest.
let me be sure 
okay.
i'd be inclined to say yes.
no, your honor. it references subsection (b).
 then it does fall within  holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.
 i think, but i can't represent to you know that i know for sure, that that is an accounting process that takes place. because these are transactions  thousands of transactions that are taking place all of the time. kansas also has a practical reason for imposing this tax on the distributors. there are x number of distributors. you can imagine how many times x there might be retailers and how many different disputes and so forth. the point  one of the points that this court has repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter-sovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is vitally important that there be certainty, predictability, and some understanding of fixed events with respect to taxation. states can't be engaged in litigation constantly, depending upon how many casino customers were here, how many people bought this gasoline, how many people bought that gasoline the next month, and how much did the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation. that kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever, and it  and it sentences the states to litigation, and this court to repeated decisions, based upon specific facts. that's why, we submit, that although the balancing is overwhelmingly in favor of the state, because it's a tax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads that the state has to pay for, that, in this situation, one balancing test makes little sense. it simply invites litigation 
thank you, mr. dellinger. the case is submitted.
yes, mr. chief justice. this  i mean, this court has already said that with respect to eighth amendment rights, the turner analysis does not apply. so with respect to basic  basic necessities, health care, food, and water, the  the turner analysis doesn't apply, and so you could not sort of create an incentive program to take away eighth amendment rights. and under  with respect to the rights that can be  that can be limited in order to serve legitimate penological interests, we think that  that the turner approach would give a lot of deference to and a lot of flexibility to states to  to use incentive programs 
 the reason that you'd have to say, "you will not be better off  you will not be worse off in respect to the death penalty, by  you know, we  it won't" 
well, i believe, number one, does it matter which standard applies as part of the question presented? does it matter which harmless error standard is implied? my answer to that is no, because mr. fry prevails under either brecht or chapman. and this court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question, like many court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, brecht or chapman, when there has been no chapman analysis in the state court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable chapman analysis in the state court. most courts confronted with that issue say, we don't need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards. and i simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference. it seems like 
and 
the jury could have weighed these things, but there is no way, even for a psychiatrist or a psychologist, much less a juror to  to be confident because of the inherent, documented transiency of the adolescent personality. no psychiatrist and no juror can say with confidence that the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17-year-old, on the average 2 years ago  and this is the key point  proceeded from enduring qualities of that person's character as opposed to the transient aspects of youth, and therefore 
if the consulate official knew that a national of that country was being detained and wanted access to that person and that was being denied by  by the state officials, there would be no remedy in federal court? the consulate  the foreign country could not obtain  could not get federal enforcement of that right to get access?
yes, but whether it does or 
to the best of our knowledge, it was solely done within the department of justice.
justice breyer, our primary concern in this case is with the way that the court of appeals articulated the applicable standard, which we believe may have pernicious effects in future cases. and so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate for the court to vacate and remand for the court of appeals to apply the correct standard. but just to be clear 
i don't think that's right, justice scalia. i don't think there's anywhere close to a showing  i don't think there could be anywhere close to a showing that you've got the vast majority of use from  for infringement from the time that the device comes out. i just don't think that's 
yes, your 
and they're not burdening you anyway  anyway. just don't take the money.
i  i agree it's never  you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.
but what's the answer to my question?
no. but you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. and in  in that conflict, i don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.
the question is whether there may be another six months added on to that five or six-year period.
a number of courts have reached that result, your honor. footnote 25 recites five court of appeals decisions to that effect. but our primary submission in this court is that regardless of the damages that are available on a fourth amendment claim, that the mounting of damages did not delay accrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter what damages the plaintiff is seeking. the reference in heck to a claim for damages for unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a shorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional violation that can be brought through the vehicle of section 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover damages for the incarceration. 1983 of course itself does not create any substantive rights. the plaintiff needs an underlying claim and in this case of course the plaintiff only has the fourth amendment claim. we do have, in our brief and argument why the fourth amendment should not be regarded as allowing those damages, but our primary submission and we do think the court can decide the case without  without reaching that issue. the only date to delay an accrual in this case was the date that the charges were nol prossed. but that date is meaningless for the fourth amendment and it is therefore meaningless for accrual. we would the judgment be affirmed.
"we shouldn't have sued you." why don't you just take them at their word and sue them?
thank you, ms. hollander. mr. kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.
 that been true for a number 
this wasn't addressing  this wasn't  didn't involve prosecution, though. it didn't involve unlawful prosecution.
yes or no, in your view. the purpose is to disclose potential explosives in a parked vehicle.
i believe so.
well, didn't the california supreme court answer that in 
no, no. you said  you  you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for a, but he arrested him for b instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay. and on their view, it's  as long as  it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause. on your view, you're going to add a little thing. you're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal. so you say  because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch. so i just wondered why not. i mean, they got the wrong guy for throwing the punch. you know, so  so what? why is that so  that  that supposedly in your view is some terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it, it's not a terrible constitutional harm. and i'm just puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why.
but it's not reasonably likely that the jury would have understood that to mean that they should accord any special weight to the title of special circumstances, apart from the overall umbrella of the 
i just don't understand that argument.
if 
but the court has said there is a fundamental difference between being singled out, as in wooley, to have a license plate, as in pruneyard, to have someone on your premises. in pruneyard, the court said that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to allow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was not required to support a government slogan. when it is 
let me give you two ways this case, if  if we assume the state's version of events is correct, could have easily been proved. one is that the caller said that a man named mike was at her house during the entire event. when the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later, they never even got mike's last name. and, of course, justice breyer, the reason why is because they were probably thinking of the roberts framework and that they wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned police work would have presumably found a witness that witnessed the whole event that they could have put on the stand. the second thing the state could have done in this case is they could have filed the case in a way that they obtained a preliminary hearing. if what the state says is correct that ms. mccottry was cooperating up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary hearing, they could have preserved her testimony. this court in california against green and roberts itself said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the confrontation clause. and if the court has no further questions, i'll reserve the remainder of my time.
never.
i don't think he's saying that. i don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust. some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. i think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. it didn't have to be this scheme. it could have been some other scheme. nothing in the nature of things says official that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this. it rather was simply imposed by the fcc. that's fine. but to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any fcc regulation to be unjust.
thank you, counsel. ms. maynard.
because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound  within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the united states, and so similarly, we will extradite to japan. we don't want them to look at our system and judge it. we're sending somebody to be tried there. so extradition is  is something entirely different than 
no, justice scalia.
if  if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can't a decision to require drug testing be one?
yes.
 there are some items where your client bought the truck.
we don't agree with that, your honor. in cases where resale price maintenance is being used to facilitate cartelization, either at the manufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could prevail. also in, for example, in an oligopolistic market.
well, the statute could not be more clear, justice scalia. it is the receipt by the distributor of the fuel. that is what the statute says. it is as plain 
you've given us the answer. what's the standard that you use to get to that answer? do you go back to the definition that it  it cannot practicably be used?
i think the court's decision in jackson transit sets up the framework for that, and that is, that congress did assume there would be a contract cause of action, but 
because 
thank you, counsel. mr. gossett, you have 2 minutes remaining.
that's a separate requirement. i don't know if it's constitutional or not constitutional, but i didn't think that requirement was at issue here. the requirement of stating the facts is not the requirement of setting out the elements of the law. at least that's my understanding. now, you can correct me if i'm wrong.
that's precisely my argument.
 no government speech.
yes.
justice scalia, two important points. first is that neither the criminal conviction nor the jury's verdict determined the cause of insolidity. the issue in the criminal case and the issue in the false claims act case as to pondcrete was that the pondcrete was insolid and they were lying to the  the government about that.
why can't you make the determination? isn't the  the problem that your determination may not be as reliable? and i thought ultimately your argument would boil down to saying this. the reason you will accept the plea colloquy or the plea agreement, if it sets out the facts, is that that is very reliable. it is a reliable indication of what he was pleading guilty to and what the court was finding him guilty of. but once you go beyond that and you start looking into police reports appended to complaints or whatnot, you're getting into an area of less reliability, and when we're dealing with sentence enhancements like this, we better be reliable. that's why the statute based it on  on offense rather than facts. don't get into a factual determination that is unreliable. i thought that was your argument ultimately.
 or not?
does the  do the actual contracts reduce the  the csc's to a dollar amount or 
and  and that that's the  that's the answer.
yes.
well, at least to the extent that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance to quote public sources in  in return.
ms. kirkland, assume for a moment  i know you don't agree, but assume that the court, or a majority of it, were to hold that california appears to be a "weighing" state. this case arose before the enactment of the federal law that we call aedpa. so, i guess pre-aedpa law governs. and we would then have to consider  what?  whether this is harmless error? but the third question that you raised was  apparently did not incorporate any consideration of the brecht standard. is that what would be applied if we had to address the consequence here, of holding it to be a "weighing" state?
i'm sorry, justice scalia?
and i would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other schedule i substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.
i understand your question. in california, justice ginsburg, a nonviolent drug offense, the possession of a small amount of an illegal substance, is not a basis for revocation of parole. it is not possible to revoke parole in california for this offense. so, parole revocation would not have been a possibility here.
absolutely. the court has recognized, in pickering and in other cases, that the threat of dismissal from public employment is a potent means of inhibiting speech. public employees who speak up within their workplaces about police brutality, falsification of evidence, disaster preparedness, and so on, should not be compelled to shade the reports and the recommendations and tell their superiors only what they want to hear or else face reprisal for their candor.
thank you, general. official the case is submitted.
i mention the model penal code as just something that's regarded as an authoritative definition with regard to criminal law. there's many jurisdictions around the country, including at the federal level, consistently saying a substantial step is sufficient for an attempt. another example that was mentioned was the subordinate enforcer. but the subordinate enforcer would be likely considered part of a conspiracy or an accomplice.
they've decided 
could you give an example, general chanos, of one that is other than gideon? is there any other one, or 
because the underlying facts are already before the jury, and they can make their own judgment about them.
no, absolutely not. but 
oh.
 the court's commerce clause 
i'm not sure, because if you lose on the whole thing  suppose you were to say congress doesn't have the power to do anything there. i just wonder if (b) and (c) would survive, because they may have had something else in mind. but maybe that's too complicated to go into now.
okay.
oh.
thank you, mr. eastman. the case is submitted.
yes.
the ibla rejected them because it said it has no jurisdiction. this was at  in its decision at 170 ibla in 2006. no jurisdiction to consider whether the motive was retaliatory, whether it was unconstitutional, whether it was part of a pattern. and this court has said that one can't use the apa in that way either. nor could an injunction be used to get a pattern like this because of rule 65d and international longshoremen, try to frame an injunction saying: don't keep trashing this guy and ruining his business and harassing and surveilling his guests and whatever else you can come up with in order to squeeze his property out of him. no other remedy will work.
so you think it's superfluous. 1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in futility, because the law already did what 1519 said.
how  how does that work in  in practice? is it easily accessible? suppose the company 
 an adversary 
what's the argument that they propose to say it's not testimonial? i know you disagree with it, but 
very well, mr. rashkind.
yes, your honor, i would.
your honor 
didn't congress rule  rule out 60(b) in  in death cases?
correct.
the assumption is that under the first tier in donnelly and darden that the statements were improper in the sense that within the context of the multi-factor kind of considerations, whether or not they were improper, because obviously 
but respect to the rico claim, assuming the rico claim is upheld, what do you say to your brother's argument that there is no history of qualified immunity for rico claims? that the qualified immunity doctrine addresses the, the kind of development of squishier law under  under 1983. so that you simply have not qualified immunity.
may i ask you 
yes.
 appears, "whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force" 
 no longer existed at that point.
respectfully, i disagree, your honor. where you have the government taking over a service entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination because there is no local private interest that is advantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of state interest. that is where the dormant commerce clause is primarily 
that's true, your honor.
even a radio wave. microsoft has patent claims for software.
we wouldn't have to.
that's true.
sure, it embraces it because it's broader, which means that if you raise  if you  if you make a claim under the state standard, you are not necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more restrictive federal standard.
i don't think that would be proper for the courts to do that, your honor, but the other issue that's presented by these cases is whether the use of race is narrowly tailored. and the district court found in this case that it was, was for a variety of reasons. so i think that this case does not, your honor, present the hypothetical that you suggested and in other cases with different factors 
 they think  well, they can tell me. all right.
my guess is that we did not pay, because that 
no, it does not, justice o'connor. and  and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was 
what was so unusual about the facts in steiner? they're pretty common.
well, with respect, justice o'connor, i don't think either lopez or morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the controlled substances act, and i think, in particular, that's because the decisions in lopez and morrison cited, with approval, cases like darby and wickard, and preserved those cases. and, of course, the concurring opinion of justice kennedy did so, as well.
thank you, general. the case is submitted.
 then 
but once, at least 
apart from 
what if its purpose were to demonstrate  and i quote from one of our earlier opinions  that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being. what if that were its purpose? would that have made it bad?
and would you also agree with the second question i asked as to whether if it were a violation  i understand you don't think it was  it would not be a defense that they were able to create a district  a hispanic district in another part of the state.
that's 
it doesn't  justice kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of  of the statute. congress didn't think in terms of  as it did in the oil pollution act, it said, if there's a conflict with international law, work it out. get the coast guard with the foreign nations and work out the conflict. it didn't put anything like that in this statute, which is a further indication that if congress wants to extend this kind of disability protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so willingly. and the government has had 13 years to come up with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. most of the regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an application to a large passenger cruise ship. if congress wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this court need not open up a pandora's box of domestic legislation to apply to foreign ships where congress has not expressed the intent to do that.
they did not include it, and under 
i would 
that's true, but the drugs were  in this case, the drugs were in his pocket. so, it wouldn't have helped him.
no, because counsel looked  5 followed up in an objectively reasonable place. their 6 testimony was that they hired two more experts to look at 7 this issue, and dr. gross did not conclude 
i  i think two things. i think, one, the reasonable conclusion is the prosecutor is making it up, but even if the court  the court doesn't need to accept that to still come to the conclusion and say the demeanor rationale is still not the reason for the strike. she can't say the reason here. she comes up with six different reasons, but they're all either 
what do you make of the judge  well, the jury, already having been polled, and every one of them said this would not affect our judgment?
if it's excessive detail, the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date at such and such a time he attempted to?
but  but i'm talking about the witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply doesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you  and you can't find the witness. how often does that happen?
no, but that's the example they're saying it would be following. it's not a brand new idea.
that's right.
correct.
all right, so 
but there's no statute and there's no regulation that requires florida to do that.
it sort of it did that in broadcasting, didn't it? i guess they could have written it to say that "the fcc shall regulate common-carrier communications in the public interest, convenience, and necessity," which would put the fcc in the same situation with regard to this, as it's in with regard to broadcasting.
and there are circumstances in which it has, and those in which it has not. and to try to respond to justice scalia's point, again i would invoke the 200 years of responsible regulation of the practice of medicine, which is the backdrop against which congress legislated in this case. congress does not lightly assume, nor should it, that states are going to  are going to simply legalize drugs to make people happy. it hasn't happened. congress doesn't assume it's going to happen. states act responsibly. congress assumes 
i think it  it may be that there's another side to that story. for example, i think the bankruptcy court was heard from first. arguably, that's binding on the texas court. whether the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get full faith and credit. that's one argument. another is perhaps you can explain to me how this all started because i thought that it was a claim made against her in the bankruptcy court for defamation. then the claim that she asserts is a compulsory counterclaim. she has to make it there or she'll lose it.
mr. shapiro, can this case, in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?
no, it certainly doesn't, justice stevens.
when you say extra culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same time  murder, rape, and kidnapping. they're all very serious crimes. and if you sentence them consecutively, you will take into account that there were three. if you sentence them official concurrently, it doesn't matter. the washington court says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to sentence consecutively if do you more than that. you have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special kind of kidnapping.
because if it's not a public use, then you can't 
well, in 3553(c), it requires that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence.
it  it could have a main office that's different from what one would construe to be its principal place of business under the test that applies to corporations under 1332(c), if  if that's what you're asking, so that factual circumstances 
may i ask you this question? assume you're correct that as a whole the plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth. does that necessarily mean that every district within the  the plan is immune from constitutional attack?
well, suppose you have a big crate that the postman uses, because you've been away for a week and yet the mail  and he leaves a crate there, and you trip on the crate. under your view, there would be liability, because the crate's like the  the crate isn't the mail.
well, i  actually i  i didn't get into that one way or the other. let's assume we've got a case in which the client says, no, i  i don't agree to these concessions. i'm not guilty and i want a defense. as i understood your  your earlier answer, you said if  you know, if it is the lawyer's considered judgment that this is the only way to save his life  he's talked with him, et cetera  he  he still may have that option to concede. and i'm taking the  the facts one step further and saying let's assume the  the client goes whole-hog in his objection. and he stands up or  or says in front of the judge and the jury, i  i'm not conceding any of this.
it could have, but it  the court did it in two steps, and we believe it's because the ninth circuit recognized that it couldn't get to brecht unless it found that california's attempt to cure the error under clemons failed.
it seems to me that the principal difference, mr. niver, is that when he's on parole, it's in lieu of being in jail. if that's not the difference, you don't persuade me. he has voluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his getting out of jail. and he'd be in worse condition if he were in jail. that's what, seems to me, makes the difference.
can we return to 
that presents a different legal issue because a variance means they alleged a, they proved b. here they did not allege a. nothing was alleged.
what the court needs to analyze today is whether an emergency statement where somebody is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the call is testimony. and it's not testimony because the sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case are not present, and the information has, as justice scalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's very different from the kind of submission of an affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that prompted the confrontation right. the framers were thinking about things that we all would recognize as testimony, being deposed, submitting an affidavit, appearing before a  a magistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the word witness in the confrontation clause not only to refer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but in connection with knowledge that the same word appears in the fifth amendment and in the sixth amendment compulsory process clause, where in all of those contexts, its most natural application is to the formal acquisition of evidence.
well, i think it would be imprudent to decide  i  i think that the court will have to elaborate on the williamson county requirement and how the procedures work. i hope, after all the preparation for this argument, i'll be able to participate in some way in that debate because it's a really interesting question. but it's not presented here because even if you were to reconsider williamson county, even if you were to overrule it, it wouldn't affect the outcome here. we know two things are true in this case, whatever williamson county means doesn't mean or shouldn't mean. every issue relevant to the federal constitutional claims was fully and fairly litigated in this case, and we also know that under 
yes, your honor, i do. and because the  the  assuming  on the assumption that this is really a  a burden on property rights that would be subject to the takings clause, then that burden requires compensation unless there's some limitation on the compensation principle. and the limitation that the court has recognized, growing out of pennsylvania coal, is the need for the government to function. so we have an inquiry into whether this furthers the governmental purposes. now, in your example, your honor, i don't think there's any question that that inquiry would be satisfied. our point is simply that the inquiry must be made.
yes, justice kennedy. so, it will depend on what the particular state's law is. here, the only private-person law that was argued below was the good samaritan doctrine, and  as a possible analogy to the conduct of the mine inspectors here. but it might 
 for purposes of the lawsuit.
thank you, mr. robbins.
the illinois appellate court overturned the conviction on the basis that it was obtained through use of a confession in violation of the fourth amendment only. the only findings that have ever been made regarding mr. wallace's confession, the voluntariness of the confession, were made in the illinois circuit court, and the finding was that the confession was voluntary, that it was not coerced. that finding has never been reviewed. petitioner did file both fourth and fifth amendment claims in this civil case, but we did not assert statute of limitations to the fifth amendment claim for precisely the reasons that i indicated to justice stevens. and for that reason, although the question was presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in the fifth amendment portion of question 1 of the petition, and the court did not grant the fifth amendment claim. so i do not believe  a short answer, sorry  i do not believe it was a pleading error. it is simply that that claim as the litigation developed is not before this court now, but not through a simple pleading error. it is a far more weighty problem than that.
but if he's credible that white confessed to him 
and  and it seems to me it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here in the answers you've attempted to give.
so if they had combined and if they had agreed in the joint venture to sell a new brand of gasoline, equilon gasoline, of course, they would  the joint venture would be free to set the price of that.
well, you  the  you assert that would be the case, don't you?
oh.
i agree.
my point here is that with respect to the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus within the united states, as it happens, exactly the same lineup as existed in  as existed in  was true in atkins. we have not just a worldwide consensus that represents the better view in europe. there are 194 countries 
the right-and-wrong prong 
he 
well, your honor 
well, sure, but then the question is whether the state can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it. so in effect it's diverted.
well, it can also enter judgment, which constitutes another denial 
well, the same way the inmate would do it in any other litigation that is brought by an inmate. the burden is on a litigant to prove their case, and it doesn't change because that litigant is in prison.
so that there hasn't been a decision by a federal judge on whether or not there's merit to your case.
okay.
but no legal difference.
that's not entirely true, justice scalia, because there certainly were many jurisdictions, even at the time of the founding, that provided for the appointment of counsel if the defendant was not able to retain his own counsel.
what is the argument?
the case is submitted.
on different claims, your honor. he had a first, a  under what was called the pcha in pennsylvania. the tolling question here is whether the pcra petition 
 procedure 
well, this court's decisions suggest that the record has to at least have been within congress's awareness at the time the statute was passed.
i agree that that's the extreme, but you're urging us to  to adopt a test that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the hypothetical i just gave you. and you  you can accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing is  is really quite extreme.
well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument. but you  but you want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. if indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the rule of reason would allow you to argue that.
who were the people that helped him hold up his flag? were they not classmates of his?
well, mr. joseph, i 
you haven't addressed adverse action at all.
may i ask you a question? it's a bit tangential just a little bit, but going back to the chief justice's question earlier about diversion? and his suggestion was, if they're  proselyte the religion, you get all sorts of converts who will just use it in the same way as the small number use it now. would that be diversion, or would it be diversion  diverting it to some people who are not members of the religion?
right.
well, perhaps i misunderstood justice souter's question, but i have this concern, and i thought it was his concern as well. at the appellate level, is the presumption something that can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing or is it just an initial benchmark? we're playing with standards and words here.
i attend a moot court at notre dame in about your year and it was an awfully good moot court.
and i would further note 
well, you're taking the position then, as i understand it  and i  i don't disagree with your  your position necessarily  that its construction or application 
the trial judge said that. the trial judge said it lacked the type of corroboration.
thank you, mr. wray.
well, i 
i think that type of argument was belied by what, what happened at the time of sentencing.
and it's going to skew the decisions.
i 
in my case, you said you understood that the sixth circuit would say that although he identified x and y in stage two and at stage three, and there had been merit for adjudication at those stages, understanding who the named respondents were, the sixth circuit would nonetheless say you had failed to exhaust because back at stage a you mentioned x but not y. what is the justification, if that is still your answer, what could the justification for that be?
and the court has never held that.
it says a state. it doesn't say county.
why 
well, our position is that he hasn't established a constitutional tort or an actionable claim under rico.
well, there can be a process patent.
would that have been enough?
i think they are different cases, your honor, i'm not willing to concede that they are closer cases. i think that in, in the juror's mind, the only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in these cases is that the defendants are likely to be dangerous in the future. that is exactly the same conclusion that would have been compelled by the evidence in penry. i think that 
but in that case, it's not the skull itself that is preventing the delivery of the fetus.
and i'll assume with you, for the moment, that  that the treaty has to be read as saying you have to have some kind of appropriate remedy, but it doesn't say what kind. so why isn't it an appropriate remedy that he was given a lawyer, if he wanted one, and the lawyer either told him about the right to talk to the consul or he didn't. and if he didn't  if he did, he found out, and if he didn't and it mattered, maybe that was ineffective assistance of counsel. so if we have ineffective assistance of counsel claims to take care of the tough cases where it really did matter, doesn't that suffice under the treaty, or does it?
mr. chief justice, when i read the opinion in united states vs. williams, the nordic case was brought up by the dissent in that case, that there must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit against the united states. the holding in united states versus williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad. and given that holding, and given the fact that the government was asserting that mrs. williams had other remedies in the form of a quiet title action, a refund action 
yes, absolutely, your honor 
okay, but we didn't announce a standard.
 understand. why doesn't the tribe have an incidence of not having any tax at all, helping 
 evidence.
it's old stuff.
no, your honor.
well, how would it be focused if you're talking about whether it's in their economic interest? you would have to say why, why didn't you enter into this particular realm of competition and they would say, well because we were doing other things. we had other areas that we were focusing on. and they would have to document all that to your satisfaction.
i guess i misunderstand your point, because i think when the court said there's no possible prejudice 
this instruction 
and we certainly did not with a spending clause case.
and to expose everything i was  perhaps the better thing is to say, "there's always a private analogy," or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party.
no. i realize it's wrong, but i think that's probably the assumption congress made. that's what i'm suggesting.
i wish you hadn't said that. because i had thought that one of the things that made this case leaning in your direction is the fact that merely having a picture of their loved one on the button doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant, or even convict the defendant. it just conveys, at most, to the jury, you know, this is  we have been deprived of someone we love, you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully. it is an important matter to us. and therefore, you ought to deliberate carefully. i don't know that it means anything more than that.
it's a quite different assumption.
within 2 months of each other. within a month of each other, your honor.
well, i do take issue with that. as i read the record in wickard, it involved a small farmer. a portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. it also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. he used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. i think wickard can be distinguished on the facts.
well, it seems to me that that is an entirely different argument. the question is what does the statute require her to do and entitle you to do. and i don't see why, under the statute, the statute is not satisfied if you simply sue for the difference under  under your assignment of her rights.
but still, is this another  could  could we do this? i noticed that  that your  the petition for cert in benitez has two questions, both of which are about interpreting 1231(a)(6). the government's petition, though not its brief  the government's petition in crawford says the question presented is whether 1231(a)(6) in zadvydas compelled a release. so this other  this other matter is a totally  seen as a totally separate ground. perhaps the thing to do is we send it back, and if they want to raise it, they can raise it, and it would be up to the circuit to decide whether they had preserved it or not preserved it. is that  is that a sensible thing?
and sometimes he may be going into the wrong house and the person suing him may not be a criminal, but may be some  some innocent  innocent bystander. and  and what about  you know, you say there's no incentive to knock and announce. there  there may  you don't know any michigan cases in which a  a civil suit has succeeded, but i know numerous cases in which police who  who burst in without knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger, that is, to being shot at by a  by a householder who doesn't know that they are the police. isn't that enough of  of an incentive, the fact that you may lose your life?
the two  the two other 11 psychiatrists. because the issue wasn't alcoholism.
no, there are  there are two elements to this, justice scalia. you first have to demonstrate that there's discrimination. and the way you demonstrate anticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a consistent pattern. it has to be substantial discrimination over a substantial period of time. if we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis, presumably today you got a deal with a customer, and i'll give you a 10 percent, and then the chief justice got a deal tomorrow, and i may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the line, the situations will likely be flipped out. you're not going to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 102 sales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the basis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the first instance, justice scalia.
justice 
because the constitution contemplates that the grand jury be independent, that its decision 
the waiver of sovereign immunity is the jurisprudence of this court, that eleventh amendment sovereign immunity is not absolute, that a sovereign can waive that sovereign immunity. and it did, in gardner versus new jersey. and, again, this court looked at that in the lapides case.
just on the second point. i wanted  does the rule of the federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? i know our chick kam choo precedent where we said federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court, but supposing in this case that the parties went to san francisco with a  and said we want to sue there. would the san francisco court, the united states district court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by chinese law, and that the chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?
well, we certainly could have had a psychiatrist argue that in  generally speaking, adolescents are less mature and on a range of psychosocial factors, they 
so, a tax  just  so, a taxpayer in wyoming can't challenge the state tax, because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in new york city can challenge the city tax, because it's not.
well 
that's  yes, but under state law, you only have 60 days to get that. so someone in pennsylvania who finds a brady claim, say, has to get back into state court within 60 days of discovering that. so his  he  he could go into state court 
 and  and it's  it's a misbranded, false statement. now, does he have to change the label or could he change the product?
a person can do that, yes. and, of course, independents are growing. i think, as you know 
yes.
justice ginsburg, every other type of claim under this program is in federal court already, denials of benefits cases, disputes between the carrier and the united states. only a sliver of lawsuits, these reimbursement suits, are  are left. and it would be anomalous to  for congress to have wanted those to be in state court. but even aside from that, a federal forum offers the 
even though two u.s. attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent means.
this is an abundance of caution?
but that had nothing to 
no 
 didn't say if they had protection against harassment and so forth. suppose they just said, "cart blanche, you can search any parolee at any time, any place." and then you'd ask whether this search was reasonable.
i believe it is, justice scalia, because 
well, you got a  you got a warrant 
they argue it in their reply brief here.
with  with non-visible restraints. is that perfectly okay?
i think, even in that hypothetical case, which i will say, next, is not this case  even in that hypothetical case, it is still the plaintiff who has the cleanest hands of all. the plaintiff's hands are cleaner than those of the defendant 
it 
right, right. but i'm saying the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.
i'm not going to say here that we wouldn't have some defenses that me may want to invoke at a future time, but i'm not very optimistic, because i think the fact that you  they may not have a box doesn't mean that we could put it  assuming your theory that we're liable  put it somewhere negligently 
so anytime there's an advance notice that you will  there will be some kind of action in response to a  a claim, that would be retaliation.
well, looking at it very broadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the united states did not waive sovereign immunity for a particular category of tort case, that a dismissal of such a tort case should bar an  an action by an individual against an individual defendant, just looking at it in  in a global sense. and that's what the plain language of the statute also says. so i don't really see any tension. i  maybe i'm missing something obvious here.
no. i think it's very difficult in that case. in heck against humphrey, which this court viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding conviction, the court held that there had to be a favorable termination of the criminal proceeding in order to maintain the civil action for damages under section 1983.
that's as good as we could do.
yes.
we're not trying to have it both ways, justice souter. the fact that the geneva conventions are part of the law of war doesn't mean that petitioner is entitled to any protection under those conventions. and 
yes, your honor. and i think your point, as i understood it, in o'neal was that it analytically does not make sense 
well, if it's just skidmore, forget about it. [laughter.]
i wasn't anxious to accept it, justice scalia, but i  [laughter.]
general, does  does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike was, or does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike wasn't?
but there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder.
right.
and which is the statutory section again.
you can, and on  on your analysis, why isn't that sufficient?
 could put on it, within the context of harassment or 
try  try this simple rule. where you're dealing with a statute of limitations that has exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not assert the existence of one of those exceptions.
i  i have a general question which is not pennsylvania. i've looked up or got a rough idea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in many states, and most of them are a year or more. so there's no problem. but 11 have less than a year, and in particular, oklahoma has 3 months apparently. and oklahoma is  a lot of death cases come out of oklahoma. so what rule would  where i have to have  i focus on oklahoma for the reason that i think this has bite only in death cases because i don't see why anybody would want to abuse the system except in a death case. but there are a lot there. now, am i supposed to say in oklahoma which has the 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has filed a petition in state court, let's say, on the 180th day, and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also run to federal court and file a protective petition which could well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds? what's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know what to do? and one system that might work is justice scalia's idea.
but the court has also held that once congress creates a reservation, once it confers explicit federal protection on particular lands, the reservation can be diminished or disestablished only by act of congress; it can't be terminated through adverse possession. and with respect to the question of whether delay in buying the land should be analogized to delay in bringing a 
no, no. i'm reading the warrant. i'm not reading the affidavit. it happens to say that the affidavit is  that that affidavit is  it's in appendix a, appendix b, but it doesn't say anything about going in on  where does it say that?
one question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us. i'm curious about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. what happened to that?
may i  may i go back to your answer to the  the question whether in the absence of an answer, there is a presumption of a batson violation, and you said, no, there isn't a presumption 
that's what 
yes, actually we're making both arguments. our basic argument is that all along, they have interpreted it in a certain way. and then 19 years later, they reversed course. and that is arbitrary and capricious, justice breyer, and it is a basis on which to defend the judgment of the court of appeals.
so would you explain to me if there's any practical effect to your winning in this case?
but what he  i  i take it the ripeness issue is  he delayed in bringing it because he wasn't certain what you'd do. and  and one of the reasons, i think, would be that it's only recently there was an article in the lancet 
i didn't know that those were treated as taking cases.
if mr. johnson had done that in 18 this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute 19 of limitations. if mr. gadsen had done that in the fourth 20 circuit case by judge wilkinson, he still would have 21 missed the 1-year statute of limitations.
i think that's correct. that is the way that it could be done. there's an informal process that's typically followed; but you could ignore it, and there's no legal operative effect. so, that 
 but not for this case.
 about the catchall trust?
shouldn't we send that back? i mean, i thought we were here to decide one question, that the federal circuit has said that, "unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a declaratory judgment action, because of the constitution of the united states." now, i have to admit, i've looked up, or i've had my law clerk look up, probably now hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a requirement. indeed, the very purpose  as i  we've just heard the sg say, of this act, the declaratory judgment act, seems to be to allow people who  a contract  who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract. but i might be wrong about that. but you've now argued a different point.
well, your honor 
yes. so i'm not sure if beck even applies on its own terms.
the legislative history makes clear that the twenty-first amendment was intended to eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant commerce clause and authorize states to regulate it.
not from insulating them from competition, your honor, but the state of oklahoma does have  it has a closed primary system. it has  it has an interest. and this court has found that interest, as recently as in timmons, that it does have an interest in a stable political system, which may be a two-party system. as long as 
but your position would be the same even if scott knew that the only reason they were trying to stop him initially was the speeding violation?
well, again, i think he could  he could bring that claim. i don't think it would be well taken by the  by the commission. i don't think it's a valid claim. i also don't think, if  there's any reason why that claim has to be brought at this stage in the procedure. we think that abstention 
but that's what justice souter has identified, right? that's not because they're adopting different standards.
so the same statutory requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges is the one he acknowledges is available.
yes. i'm sorry, mr. chief justice. there  the donning and doffing in the alvarez case, by and large, happens in one place: in a locker room. in the tum case, by contrast, the employees show up at a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up something else, they wait, they pick up something else. and so, there's a body of time that i refer to as the donning and doffing process. all of that would clearly be compensable, even in your hypothetical. your hypothetical would address the final piece of time, and that is, you get your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to the floor, and the employer could say, "take a 15 minute break," in there. i suppose that's hypothetically possible. i think the reason it doesn't happen in these cases and in the other cases i've studied is that the employer has an incentive, when they're forced to compensate, to do things efficiently. what happens is, the employer will say, "all right, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the morning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at 6:23." that's a 7-minute window, and that forces the employees to do everything efficiently. they don't insert artificial breaks.
and then the lawyer for the state says, "oh, my goodness. quite right. we'd like to amend."
sorry?
the fact is we don't know what that original panel thought.
it  it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after i say that, i can't tell you why. (laughter.)
yes, "shall."
well, when you have a variance the question is how much is the variance, how far off is the variance.
but all of those courts are going to say the same thing, which is that this issue has been resolved. it's possible, presumably, you might get an en banc review on it, but again, you don't have the question  you don't have a split anywhere other than some district court decisions that have  that have recognized our interpretation. the issue is squarely posed here at this point. it's been fully briefed for this court.
i'm not sure i understand your question.
do the, would the oneidas have a claim to tax the current property owners?
your honor, i'm not sure whether that sort of factor would be upheld as a 
i understand.
do you think they were being intellectually honest in their law review or do you think  accuse them of something other than honesty in what they said?
it's a required wait anytime, in order to get to the production floor on time, the employee has to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of time to get there, and if there's a wait at that time, then he's being required to wait.
but is there other  are there other bases? because so far your argument is they're so bad that you might as well give them whatever they want because it won't matter. (laughter.)
sure. it also  it also means that if  if  assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war. (laughter.)
you mean, if you had a case where the reason you were arresting the guy is because he's shot through the door the last three times somebody knocked and announced, you still have to knock and announce, under michigan law?
well, well it's just the number of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical, justice breyer.
there's no requirement in  in 16 the fourth trigger. however 
 upon which they were relying.
okay. then why do not the parents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved, have as much right to make a claim that goes to the substantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply because the two are inseparable?
yes. unquestionably.
 in the three circuits where probable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind.
i'm saying that i  i don't  i don't think courts should ever go out and look for cases in advance. we look at the case that is 
 is not  if that speech was not required to be kept 
yes.
yes. well, the  the contribution limits that this court considered was the $1,075 
and that's your view of  of what 1182 means, and they're going to have a different view. if they want to argue their different view, they could do it in the ninth circuit. if they've waived it, they've waived it, and that's up to them, not up to us.
justice breyer, that's  that's exactly correct 
in light of the very fine line, how is the court to distinguish between  determine whether what's alleged is inextricably intertwined with authorized conduct?
 is likely, then the answer depends on whether you know that you are concealing  that you know a crime has been committed. and if you know that a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a federal statute, 18 u.s.c. 
well, established could, i suppose, mean the place of the original charter location, and located could mean the place where  where the main office is today. they could mean different things. remember that at every  at every enactment of this statute, there was no difference between established and located. the terms had no different application because a national bank had only one location, which was the place where it was established. so as a practical matter, there was total parity with state banks because up until 1958 a corporation was a citizen only of the  its place of incorporation, and there was total parity with national banks because they were  they were confined to their original state. they could not branch outside their state until 1994. so we are interpreting statutes that were passed for the purpose of achieving parity and at a time when they succeeded in achieving parity. and  and the chief justice's question and  and your question suggest that today, with the changes in the map of interstate banking, you might have some small lack of total overlap between state banks or other corporations, on the one hand, and national banks. but that is not a reason to say that national banks are citizens of every place where they have any physical presence. and one of the problems with the fourth circuit's reading is that it injects substantial ambiguity into the question of where a bank is located. it's  the fourth circuit said branches, but what about where it has an office that's not a branch? what about where it stores  where it has warehouses that store its records? what about where it has employees?
and if that's the only thing that the 1996 act covered, we would say, "boy, there is just an absolute conflict here. we can't have both statutes." but, in fact, we can have both statutes most of the time. we read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering everything except setoffs against social security for educational loans. and, with respect to the educational loans, we give respect to the  to the earlier decision that there be no limitation at all. you just have a weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 act only covered this case.
yes.
but assuming, assuming the contract provides that.
yes.
no, justice ginsburg. there is a standing chapter 13 trustee in chapter 13 cases that handles all the chapter 13 cases, unless for some reason that chapter 13 trustee must recuse him or herself. under section 348, once the case is converted from 7 to 13, the chapter 7 trustee services are terminated.
no, but  your point.
yes. it's under florida rule of criminal procedure. it's geared specifically to death-sentenced individuals as opposed to being  we don't have available what's under florida statute. chapter 119 is not available to a death-sentenced inmate. so we must proceed through the 3.852 procedures, and that was not activated until the point in time that the warrant was actually signed. we filed other pleadings in the court that were denied regarding mental retardation, regarding a roper claim, and various other  other claims. ultimately, we also filed in regards to the public records claim and us being denied the public records and the ability to assess the protocol. florida 
but isn't  isn't that the point? the dredge is there necessarily to move. the casino is not there necessarily to move.
there is a 10 percent penalty. however, as the bankruptcy 
i understand that.
i'm sorry? that's page  excuse me. page 4 of the red brief, your honor.
that is  in the california supreme court, you will find that sometimes, that they will indicate untimeliness by a case citation; hardly ever in the lower appellate court. and i would also disagree with the characterization of delay being a problem going from the lower appellate court to the california supreme court. we see it at both levels. and i would also disagree that this shouldn't be a problem because these petitioners have no incentive to delay. that may be the case, that they don't have an incentive to delay, but they do, in fact, sleep on their rights, as 
but isn't the sensible response to the situation you posit that the government shouldn't be doing it? i mean, it's a little crazy to say the government is acting crazy. therefore it  it ought to contribute money so the net economic effect is somehow zero. there's simply a transfer. the taxpayers bear a burden as  as opposed to somebody else. on the  on the justification you're giving for the test, you would say, look, if it's not substantially advancing this interest, why let the government do it at all? i'm not saying that should be the test for whether the government should do it at all. but isn't that kind of the sensible tendency of the test, to suggest that the government shouldn't even be doing it?
are you talking about the traffic pursuit?
in fact, that process, which isn't even mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal operative effect. it's more like a demand letter. if the lessee doesn't respond to the letter, he doesn't waive any of his rights. if the government fails to include a claim in its demand letter, in the  well, in the audit letter  it doesn't waive any of its rights. the 
i think that the argument in  the federal circuit's decision is wrong in its enablement discussion, it's wrong in its written description discussion. i mean, just to take one, the written description posits that this is a valid written description because the inventors, as the federal circuit says in its opinion, possessed the correlating step. and i think what's wrong about that, your honor, is that nobody can possess the correlation. and that's the nub of this case.
thank you, mr. flores. mr. rosenkranz, you have two minutes remaining.
that's correct.
it was against you, in other words.
i mean, in some sense the csra 
and if weyerhaeuser wanted to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after the logs which are open to both parties.
 i understand one thing about your position. you do agree, do you not, that in order to exhaust, even if the time has run the 15-day period, there is an obligation to go to the state and ask them to hear the case, even though it's untimely?
what's the answer to my question? is the answer that 11 of them say you can collect attorneys' fees, but only as an unsecured claim against creditors.
you 
so i'm  i'm saying it seems to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in there.
correct.
that's not the argument i was addressing. i'm addressing the argument that in changing the land, you may cause it to 
absolutely that's constitutional, and that's  that's what i mean to be saying because it's federal law 
but it doesn't count 
too favorable to you. too favorable to you again, right? (laughter.)
thank you, mr. chan. the case is submitted.
general petro, you have 3 minutes remaining.
but you  but to do that would be to invite danger to the  to the other inmate. the  the level of interracial violence in prison is high, and that can't be disregarded. and if we weren't here today 
are there any countries that recognize individually enforceable rights under this convention overseas on behalf of american citizens?
there was something 
but what  what about preclusion on other courts?
oh, sure. we had thousands of those examples.
i  i don't understand your reading of taylor. as i've read that case many times, it seemed to me that that was making a perfectly sensible point. at the end of the opinion, justice blackmun says, you know, there are some states like massachusetts, for example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say burglary of a  of a ship or a car or a building. and that leads us to answer a more general question. well, in context, that more general question is whether you ought to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to see if there was really violence or not. and he says no. just look to the definition of the crime. that's what he says. that will end it. now, he says we agree, because i started here, that we have a couple of states with some weird statutes, and what you have to do in those states is you won't know if it's a boat or a car or  so he says, for example, in a state like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's what you do. it says you may have to go beyond the mere fact of conviction. so he says go look to the indictment or information and jury instructions. that isn't a limiting phrase. that's for example. he just thought that in those cases, that's what  all you'll have to look to, for example. we happen to have an unusual case where there are no jury instructions because he pled guilty. so what's the harm of going looking to the documents that will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on these pieces of paper show? there are no boats, you know, in watertown. it's not a dock, i don't think, or at least not in that part of it. so  so i mean, what's the problem here?
because if the  if they were negotiating on behalf of the company, that is the company's right to contract. it is not the individual's right.
well, i  i don't think prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence. either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or he has not.
thank you, mr. frederick. the case is submitted.
well, if  well, first of all, the government has the ability to detain, pending the removal proceedings, of people who are trying to come into the country. the question becomes if they can't be repatriated. now, the patriot act in 1226(a) does allow, in instances of national security, for the attorney general to indefinitely detain. now, importantly, that statute provides for procedural protections and judicial review, that is absent from 
and those reasons, i would suggest, justice kennedy, were taken care of in lear, for the most part, in 1969. provisions in license contracts that prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable under the patent laws of the united states. but then, i  as i was saying, that is a matter of patent law. that's not a matter of jurisdictional law. we're here 
yes.
well, your honor, this is not one committee of congress. this was  this  the conference report was circulated to all members of congress before they voted on the final bill.
and that's available, is it not?
we have this very old judge like me. china is there. and he says: this isn't china; formosa is china. so he says remand. so there we are, china is now in the western district state court for illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money. now, you said, i thought, before that where that happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they could, china, appeal in the federal system. i thought you said that.
mr. himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented. well, that would be disabling if indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise those two additional issues. but here it is the respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if we want to.
well, that's just a question of new york law, isn't it?
but i think that's important because what  what congress has done is essentially to leave it to opm to negotiate the terms of these contracts.
you may reply to us jointly or severally, however you may want. (laughter.)
i thought the government's distinction was based on the fact that they were arrest cases. i thought that's the distinction they were making.
missouri pacific railway case.
is 
thank you, mr. goldstein. ms. smith, you have a minute and a half remaining.
two hours of scrubbing 
it is not 
you're 
in all due respect, justice scalia, the  you do not have to have market power to fix prices. that's not a criteria. that is certainly not a predicate. anybody can fix prices. you fix prices. it's illegal per se. that's the point. and 
thank you 
when you're dealing with the principle that a statute of the united states will not be construed to be in derogation of a common law unless it's clear that that's its purpose, the court should be very careful in defining what the parameters of the common law are. the court should not take a common law rule and treat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of growing a dimension that is not consistent with its purposes and that it had never assumed in any decided case as a means of telling congress, "you can't do what you have done." so i would say, justice breyer 
no, it's to protect privacy in the possessions and papers and effects. and these are possessions, papers, and effects. it goes right to what the police are trying to seize, and you have an independent magistrate make a determination that there's probable cause to believe it, et cetera, et cetera. the knock-and-announce rule is an entirely  concerned with entirely different things. and yet, you're enforcing it by excluding the papers, effects, and possessions.
i  i don't want to resist the easy burden, but i do want to tell you, as justice scalia pointed out in the florida power argument, my clients do think about these things because if  you know, if they adopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse statistical effect and they think they're likely to get sued about it, they actually do have to worry about it because these cases are tried to juries and they have to have a reasonable explanation for what their practice because they get tried to juries as disparate treatment cases. our point is not that statistics are not admissible. they are. our point is  is that they're not sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case of  because of age, as it would be in a title vii case where we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity. so it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse inference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity itself. that is the premise articulated by this court as to why the disparate impact doctrine can  can at  the prima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex. that is not true here. now, it is also the case that when this court adopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed an enormous weight on the objectives of title vii's prohibitions, which it construed to be, as justice ginsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in headwinds. well, when  when the secretary of labor proposed the age discrimination act, he gave a report to congress and he said age discrimination is different than race and sex discrimination. it is not based on animus. it is  it is not dealing with a group of individuals who have suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime because of historic discrimination. he said it's  the problem of age discrimination is the problem of over-generalization by an employer.
there's  still, the appropriate analysis, when you're talking about  basically what we have at bottom 
yes. exactly. i don't, i mean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case. if it had been we'd probably have a definitive position one way or another. but i don't think the constitutionality in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that question one way or another. i think in regards to the chasen study the last thing i would say about it though is that it's important because most of the arguments on the other side are intuitive arguments. they are intuitive arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will be more safe. and what i think is telling is that the same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be quicker and there will be less blood loss. and when that was actually tested in a controlled study, it turned out not to be the case. the last thing i'll say about the chasen study is there was this indication that the two most serious complications were associated with the d&e procedure. but one thing that i think is important to understand about the chasen study is it is a retrospective study of dr. chasen and his partner's own practice. now what they do in every case is they set out to perform a d&x procedure, and so what they are studying and what they call the d&x procedures, that cohort are the times when they tried to do a d&x procedure and they were successful. the d&x cohort from this study, is you know, are those circumstances where he and his partner tried to do a d&x procedure, weren't successful and did a d&e procedure. now why is that significant? because it shows as chasen noted in his article that in those situations that were d&es and they were associated with serious complications there was nothing he could have done about it. he could have performed a d&x, he tried to perform a d&x and it wasn't successful, so he ended up performing a d&e. and so i really think on balance the chasen study ends up supporting our position, because the first time you have any kind of controlled study what you find is that some of the intuition turns out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation. now it's not statistically robust, but i think that it does bear out one of congress's concerns.
i  i am concerned about your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge amount of claims to pay. travelers would tell us, though, that a surety is different, that they somehow stand in the shoes of pg&e or something.
 "want this part."
it could 
oh, i think it would apply to our case, as well.
well, but this is a little more focused than that, i think. there's only one competitor here, isn't there?
but you don't think that's a defense. it seems to me the state creates the very problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.
all right. you've convinced me i have a bad hypothetical. (laughter.)
i think that's  that  that 22 may well be true, justice stevens, but laches is a much 23 more  a  a case-by-case 
again, the principles would apply and there may very well be class actions 
well 
and is it  is it easy to prove that  that the price of this now valuable stock because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had they found gold? i mean, the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove that  would  i mean, if we adopted that theory.
okay.
very well, mr. digges. mr. hanson.
all right. let me, justice breyer. the experts say it's not obvious and the reason nobody did it for 12 years and the reason that asano was never combined with an electronic throttle control is explained in the record in this case and it's twofold. the first is, and i have to take you now to the picture of asano because that's what the claim that is supposed to make our invention obvious is. they say you would have done this with asano. what the experts say is this asano thing, no one would ever use it at all.
i'm sorry, i  you lost 
yes, well, what if you had an iep that the parents had initially agreed with, and then they decide it isn't working well, they want to challenge it. they shouldn't have a burden of proof?
it's kind of a catch 22.
i think there's a difference in the extent to which there is a conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer. the citizens are clearly injured when the government sets up the church.
so six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?
well, i mean, of course, in this case, the lower court said that there might have been a constitutional violation that allowed that claim to proceed in the 
do you think it would have had merit if you had made that argument?
against licensees and others. and the 
the  the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as justice breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.
thank you, mr. sacks. ms. halligan.
 of chandris.
you can call bankruptcy a default, but that's not what i mean, and you know that's not what i mean. i'm talking about a default on the workers comp obligation.
because it's not 
it would 
i  i'll accept that, yes.
 special circumstances that 
it's the ability to engage in  to use your e-mail, it's the ability 
yes, you sue  in effect, you sue the race, rather than 
no, i mean, with respect to the prisoners in this population.
yes. that's why 
he  he prepares it and submits it to the chief judge under rule  under statute  under the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the division shall become the report of the tax court within 30 days after such report by the division, unless the chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court. so  so even a tax court judge's opinion is not the report of the tax court. surely the report of the special trial judge is not either.
what's 
it could have, and here  in this sense, it could be: in the same way that i, sort of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and i only get a 1 percent salary increase, i am certainly better off, but if the reason i got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report, it's an adverse action. so the fact that you're doing somewhat better doesn't mean 
that's right. it's  it's  the main office is  is controlled by where the national bank designates its main office to be. now, it's a little bit different than corporations in the following sense, that with the main office of a national bank, it at least has to be a place where the bank is conducting the business of banking. that's required by the statutes. whereas with a corporation, you could conceivably have a situation where they were incorporated in one state 
it's not, justice o'connor, with respect. it says, notwithstanding any other provision  and i'm reading at the bottom of page 15a  the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and  and this is 
i don't think this court requires that the jury  but i think what  what i'm trying to say, i guess, is that it requires  not requires. it  it imposes deference on the trial courts that they cannot second-guess the jury, that because the jury is always free to return a verdict on the lesser offense, there simply cannot be a situation in which the trial court, based on its own assessment of the facts, gets to enter the greater.
i think they cannot prevent presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the school's own presentation of its viewpoint.
the preemption provision doesn't apply to reimbursement provisions either, your honor. it applies to 
anything else?
mr. chief justice, on this question, the answer is, no, because mr. hungar has conceded, and the commission conceded below, that congress was adopting a definitional framework. i agree, mr. chief justice, that the commission can change its policy judgement about how it wants to regulate within the definitional framework that congress adopted. so you've pointed me to a critical point, and that is to reinforce 
 with respect to what would otherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the high seas.
well, do we  we don't have the probable cause question before us, do we?
no, your honor. that was on october the 10th. the letter did not come until october the 17th. andersen learned about it on october the 19th. i'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal, please.
right.
yes, but what do you distribute?
and  and to answer the court's question, there is nothing that i'm aware of where this court has come out and said that a party is 
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
you know there have been a spate of cases that said the word "jurisdiction" has been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. and you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity, is there a federal question?
so you say that a person, even though they're not lawfully admitted into the united states, still couldn't be indefinitely detained.
i would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical official injury than the successful burglar.
so the mere fact that it's negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.
there was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. there was no findings on this issue. but then i would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. and also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the  the first thing i said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. it's unprotected speech designed to extort money from mr. cochran. that was the whole theme 
okay.
well, the content discrimination, i take it, would be raised by someone who wants to get this for political or psychological reasons 
 that it thought was appropriate, and then states 
two points. petitioner gives no meaning to words "used fairly." so if a worst statutory construction 
 by the respondent's brief.
would the government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
i  i think that might be more similar to the attorney-client relationship. but mr. banks, unlike the athlete or unlike the entertainer, had no  no ability to  to recover these funds himself. he essentially had two options. he could have either done nothing and collected nothing 
well, it is understood by everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception which is captured by using the word "direct" as in instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning whenever it is used, doesn't it? in other words, it may not have a lot of bells and whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at least it requires some direct causation as opposed to official indirect, right?
 with whether 
or as much of the record as the other side wanted to produce.
well, that's pretty good, isn't it?
i don't think so, your honor. this court has said the key is that the government can't endorse religion, in a way that makes some feel like insiders and some like outsiders. imagine somebody who is muslim or buddhist or hindu 
that's correct.
but none of the ruin occurred, as i understand it, until the corporation went bankrupt. in other words, there was no direct  the bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any more business with  with you, mcdonald. as i understand it, all the  all the  leaving dignitary harm aside, all the actual loss was  was as a consequence of the loss to the corporation. his stock fell, you know, whatever. but it  it seems all derivative from the corporate loss.
 the revenue rule is that it is a shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has been growing. it originally started out as a principle that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts that they believed were in furtherance of commerce. it gradually came under attack, because what it said is that the united states will not notice that a foreign country's laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, and so the contract will be enforced. commentators recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal interest in acknowledging each other's laws. in the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the united states or inside a foreign country  the united states, itself, tried it once in canada  to collect taxes. and countries said, "we're not going to do that. we're going to leave it to the treaty process." but the rationales that justice breyer and justice souter have articulated, about complexity of foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never been the driving force behind the revenue rule. it's been 
my position, your honor, is that the schools are entitled to make their own judgments about what messages they will disseminate. and even 
yes, but it's important to put that in context because summers is a narrow exception to the  not an exception. it's a narrow circumstance under the fourth amendment. you have to have a search warrant. it has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. it only  it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. so, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to michael jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, i don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff michael jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.
what if  what if the government takes a slightly different tack and  and you bring your essentially pl-110 neutral claim, and the government says, the only relationship upon which this claim can be based by these particular does is a spy relationship? we claim privilege, and on the basis of that privilege, we  we claim dismissal. what is your response to that?
and, justice breyer, i think the primary reason that the state is concerned with it is because of the broad holding that the oregon supreme court has announced under  about what eight amendment requires. when you combine that with what this court has said about what that means when evidence is mitigating evidence, then i think a necessary corollary of the oregon supreme court holding is that defense counsel does get to make that argument, and that the jury must 
that's unrealistic if the states allow you to file a lot of stuff. you're  you're saying the only way the states can stop this thing from going on and on and on is to adopt an absolute rigid statute of limitations, no exceptions.
right. it's a complicated answer, in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you're not an initial account here. and when you have an existing account, there's a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, but in iv there is a separate, there's another definition, and this is on, on page  sorry. excuse me. on page 3a of the appendix to our brief, iv under big i  i'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions  talks about reviewing an existing account, and it cross-referenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination. and that would include, in our view, not only completely canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. so which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder. but it could, and here's logically why, because i think the understanding of "increase" that's at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation of this statute, and that is, did the content of your information in your credit report, if it had been better, could you have had a better rate or a better deal.
most states 
the plain language of the statute says that, yes, your honor.
 your answer is yes, the states may adopt a burden-of-proof  here  standard?
that's correct, justice ginsburg. however, guilty of the charge, based on the state's evidence, without any consideration of the defendant's evidence. in this case 
kleypas didn't hold that the whole statute was bad. kleypas gave a savings construction of the statute, as i recall.
well, but let's get back to the  to the principle without just talking about these  these factfindings. it  it seems to me very odd for you to be telling us that partisan gerrymandering is  is improper when that's the sole or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying that we can't correct it when it's happened. let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan was one that was done with  without a wholly partisan intent, but over the years, it  it now freezes in the democrats or party x to having a much greater advantage than the general registration would give it. and if it leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why  why can't it be redone?
yes, but the court didn't say this guy had blue eyes.
no. the question is why would congress  let's assume we have a choice between two readings. why would congress want to give the state courts  the state banks  state banks  greater access to federal courts than it gives national banks? what earthly reason would there be for congress wanting to do that?
just  is  is it the case or not the case that if i contribute my car to drive the candidate for governor, let's say, between burlington and montpelier, and i buy the gas, does that count against the limit? yes or no. i'm a volunteer and i buy gas and drive him back and forth.
what  what specific aggravating circumstances did they jury find? you say there are statutory aggravating circumstances in missouri.
it's appendix page 3 in the brief.
may i ask this question? i think our opinion the last time around suggested that possibility would certify into the california 
is satanism a non-mainstream religion?
why doesn't  why isn't the result that you  of  of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year? and in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. in other words, they  they plan every year, not every 10 years. so why does a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a year-to-year basis?
what the court of appeals did, and where we think it got off track, was it took the  to  the phrase "parties in interest," and it  and it took cases from this court that have used the phrase "real parties in interest" to determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it used that concept on the defendant's side of the ledger. and none of the cases from this court talk about "real parties in interest" as being defendants. the explanation given by the court for doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple suits. but there are many purposes 
now you want us to hold you don't have judicial review 
but the  but the purpose of a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided that in this category.
it's the same water that went into the dam as comes out of the dam.
right.
i thought there was one aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the government was doing it on its own land, on public land. they had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they weren't trespassing, they were just making the guests feel uncomfortable.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
well, at least it was sufficiently convincing to get the florida legislature to pass a statute.
mr. 
but is that relevant to the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an attempt to preserve that power or require that power, plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of section 2.
obviously you're not. that's why i would like 
well, but your honor, we believe that that's the pragmatic result that congress intended here.
but the mere fact that you have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that if  if some other court says the same thing first, you won't be bound by that.
mr. thro, i  am i correct in assuming that if the  if the preference in a case like this, that had been given to the state, were not a bank transfer, a check, but were some tangible object, like a gold bar, that there would be in rem jurisdiction on the part of the court to get the gold bar back as a  even though its function is that of a preferential transfer?
well, in  to the extent that he's alleging that if that's  "i went to the mexican-american bar association, and i alleged  or i made statements that there were some improprieties in the district attorney's office," that would probably get past step one and the matter of public concern, and then the question would be whether or not his interest in speaking as a citizen outweighed the interests of the government.
 it does 
no. if it had said that, i would have no trouble with it. what it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to jesse williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. i don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to jesse williams' harm. that's my problem with it.
that's in an instruction, like toomey versus ohio. the judge is corrupt. it is just structural. you can't say that about crawford, or can you?
by negotiation with the respondents, your honor, by  by looking at the  the damages, the physical damages, the loss of earnings, impairment of earning capacity, all of those things. and  and however it's phrased, we essentially agreed that that was a fair value, and if their claim is limited to the medical expense component, they're entitled to $35,000.
all right. but suppose that  but wigmore says that the words, prima facie case, can be used either to describe the hicks situation, which is the plaintiff produces the four elements. the defendant sits silent, and the judge says, directed verdict for plaintiff. that's what hicks seems to say. and wigmore says the words, prima facie case, can mean that. but then he says the words, prima facie case, can also mean a different thing, and the different thing is what the judge says then is, jury, you may find for the plaintiff, not you have to. and so i guess our question is which of the two meanings shall we take here. and my question to be  to you is, why not the second? after all, the whole point of batson is in suspicious circumstances to explore matters further, and once you get to the point where you're willing to tell a jury, jury, you may, you have suspicious circumstances.
do you acknowledge there is a good federal question there at least?
in sawyer v. whitley, this court specifically said that and rejected the  the contention that additional mitigation  mitigating evidence would render a defendant ineligible of the death penalty. so this does not satisfy the actual innocence extraordinary circumstances. nor would it have 
well, of course the argument here is that this is something different from the general abuse that you're describing, because the plan didn't make any provision here for, for paying the workers comp obligation at all. what is your response to that?
mr. verrilli, what  what is your response to mr. strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the  the bank that gave letters of credit? they're just insuring  that  that's part of the plan too. they couldn't have gotten the insurance from you unless they got the letters of  of credit from the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance. and also in the case of self-insurance, which is something of a plan  i  i guess you'd call it a plan  what about the  the person who puts up the bond? that person is a kind of insurer, just as you are. do all of these people now  now get bumped up to the head of the line?
no. i was referring to a real storm drain. (laughter.)
but could she  after that assignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to do that, to recover the medical costs?
i don't think they're going to impose a constructive trust, are they? all  all they're going to say is pay her the money.
of course.
of course not.
certainly, that would be our submission.
and the special master would be out. the special master would be out of the picture, as you describe it. you  the special master would be finished. the river master would take over. has there ever been  has this court ever appointed a river master when the special master did not recommend it? and as i understand both delaware and the pecos river case, the special master recommended the appointment of a river master.
that is correct. there were facts that were presented in the presentence report that came from police reports.
yes, mr. chief justice, it's a fair point, and it is basically  aside for the, sort of, nod at history, it  mr. hungar started with that. and our point is that congress told them how to deregulate, and that 
why didn't the government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? we don't have an amicus brief here from the government, do we?
mr. phillips, before you proceed to going on to (b), the  you have set up a dichotomy between a federal question case where, as long as you have a federal question claim in the case, you qualify within those words, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction. but you say that in a diversity case, that's not so if you have people not of the same citizenship  of the same citizenship on both sides of the party line, so that you have to have a totally qualifying action on the diversity side to come within  to  to be within 1367(a). but we have had at least two cases where the starting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity rule. one was caterpillar and the other was newman-green, and the court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't complete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the one case before the case was tried, in the other in the court of appeals. so don't at least those two cases suggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in the federal court even though at the outset you don't have  fill all the requirements?
i believe  i believe so. now  now, in fact, that would provide some identifying information because it is a person who is associated with that blue  with that blue toyota. but if it's simply a officer in the donut shop, i just saw jack, he's back in town, with no clear relation to any  any crime, that's presumably just chatter and that wouldn't be testimonial even if it  even if it later becomes relevant.
that may be sufficient because it is providing enough facts to give you a reason to believe that the plaintiff has a basis for 
well, your honor, that's true, although when she went into court, i think she believed that she had a contract with the state of colorado, at least a promise by the state of colorado that she would obtain some protection.
but then, justice kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.
i think it's a materially 
ah, so it's not the purpose of the confrontation clause to keep out out-of-court accusations. only some, and which, and what's the rule?
that's right, but we've 
mr. boynton, we'll hear from you.
it's a big country, and there are a lot of things that happen out there and so i can't assume that i want you going back to chambers thinking that it can't happen. i want to answer it even if it can happen 
oh, yes, sir. that  that happens all the time.
 do you know of any case in which a lower court did not have jurisdiction, but we do have jurisdiction on appeal from in a  from a court that didn't have jurisdiction?
well, but in amos, the court was just  the  the government was just saying that one of its own statutes could be accommodated. this is something different.
what happens in cases in agencies, you know, where  where  suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses. and i was thinking of that analogy. it's possible. it happens in the federal communications commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.
thank you, your honor, i'd be happy to discuss that. as i pointed out, it's contrary to the textual language used by the congress in 1946. they meant "used fairly" to mean what the common law meant. the common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical trademarks and trade names. moreover, petitioner's interpretation is contrary to the clear focus of the lanham act, which is to prevent customer confusion. the whole point is so that you can walk into a store 
that's correct.
he may well be.
i would assume as a disincentive to  to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the  the parking 
well, but that cuts against you.
well, at this point i don't think that we can. perhaps we could have in 1998 when the ninth circuit applied the williamson county case and ordered us to go to state court with our unripe federal claims, unripe under this court's holding in williamson. but i think that at this point the question before the court is given that we've complied with the procedural requirements that this court established in williamson county, are we now precluded by issue preclusion in the second litigation that this court ordered because of the state court compensation ruling.
it would not, your honor.
 you don't have to prove that they were spies, but you have to prove that  that they had a contractual relationship with the united states. and the only contractual relationship you're asserting is the relationship of a spy.
what would your comment be on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?
because it could measure heat, it could also potentially determine when somebody was taking a bath, taking a sauna, and doing other intimate things in the house.
well, your honor, it was certainly a reason that they gave, and it was based upon a political view of the legitimacy of homosexuality.
hicks does say that. i think you're right.
and they come out exactly the same result, but you  but do you treat them differently or the same?
what differs, your honor 
oh, no, mr. chief justice. i'm not making an argument about the character or maturity of this defendant, which would have been the only thing that would be 
and do they call more than infrequently?
and you say that they operated on the assumption that it meant never.
well, when does  when does the  when do the words, or laws, in kansas city title & trust have operative effect?
 case.
it's what?
with respect to 
but  but i thought you were saying you could  you could  the  the secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. the secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.
do you think the ten commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?
well 
and we have nothing left to take away.
i think that's right, but even if it weren't, if  if you had some state that decided not to fix its law, in light of apprendi and blakely, i expect that what would happen is defendants would bring sort of  there would be a facial constitutionality problem with any attempt to prosecute under that. and that may be the way to deal with it. there's no question of willfulness here. this is decided at a time when, in good faith, pre-apprendi even  this isn't even the apprendi/blakely window  that it was acceptable to have this sort of two-tier proceedings much like we are used to in sort of a death penalty context. and there's  there's been no  i'm sorry.
because of section 6(m), your honor. section 5 of the alaska statehood act provides that the federal government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6. section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. section 6(m) incorporates the submerged lands act and thereby provides that alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the states. section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties. what section 6(e) did was to transfer to the state a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely  for the sole purpose of  of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes. those are the state  local-state fish and wildlife conservation statutes. again, here it was  it is undisputed that glacier bay is not included within the main clause. therefore, the 
maybe you can think of a unanimous case.
do they hold that the plaintiff must allege the employer is not an indian tribe? i'm over here.
and then one other 
so they're gone. now, once you acknowledge they're gone, what's the big deal about  about having the parties come up to the judge and just explain to the judge, we didn't do it for a racial reason?
well, it would be a burglary in the state of florida, but under the test enunciated in taylor, it wouldn't qualify because taylor was very specific. it is the entering a dwelling or structure. and in florida, you could be guilty of a burglary without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a curtilage burglary.
but i thought there, there was a genuine security concern, which i think you pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider what they can have in  in the cell.
okay.
well, my second point, in response to justice breyer, if i can recall it, was that in the component situation, which was one of the situations that we were talking about, that the problem with the component test, the presumptions are supposed to be easy to apply. and if you say, well, the entire device has to be patented, then the next case is going to be a case where 85 percent of the key ingredients are patented, 15 percent aren't, and the question will be, does the presumption apply? so you're  you're setting up a presumption which is designed to  for ease of application that will become extremely difficult to apply.
you really don't know the answer of whether the clock is running until the finding is made. if the  if the judge finds that  that he's not incompetent, well, too bad. you know, the speedy trial act requires dismissal. on the other hand, if the judge finds that he is incompetent to be tried, there hasn't been a violation of the act. i mean, it's a very strange situation. and it also, as  as the  the other side points out, it  it puts considerable pressure on the judge when  when he is in violation of the speedy trial act, to find that the individual is incompetent because, otherwise, there has to be a dismissal.
well, the court's map, under the 
yeah, that's correct. the docket does show that.
i believe, your honor, that a nondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it, would have to be tolerated. however, they would not have to tolerate a student who interrupts a anti-drug presentation.
 relief, but it  different considerations would affect the trial judge's decision whether to grant the motion. and i think  in a sense, this goes to justice kennedy's question  that is, one of the reasons that, at least with respect to the motion that's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that these motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case is almost always submitted to the jury, because the thought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to the jury, because the suit has been tried already, and there may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing that course. i think if a motion was made at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought it clearly had merit and thought that a substantial savings in cost and time would ensue from granting the motion, the trial judge could take that into account in deciding whether the motion should be granted or not. but i think  i think it's important to look at the text of rule 50. and it's reprinted, among other places, at page 57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition. and in  at the beginning of rule 50(a)(1), it says, "if, during a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party." again, the word "may" is permissive. so, while the judge may take into account potential savings in time and expense, the judge is never required to grant a rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge is firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is insufficient. and then, at the very bottom of the page, the first sentence of rule 50(b) says, "if, for any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury, subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion." and the significance of that sentence is that it says, "no matter what stated rationale the district court gives"  whether the district court simply says, "i'm reserving the motion," or says, "i'm denying it, because the evidence is, in my view, clearly sufficient"  "whatever stated rationale the court gives, the action will be treated as a reservation of the legal questions." and i think one of the reasons that it would be inappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim without a renewed post-verdict motion is that in order to attain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the remedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the court of appeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by the district court. and the reservation of a ruling on the 50(a) motion, by its nature, can't be erroneous. that is, the judge is specifically authorized to submit the case to the jury 
well, because this court decided 
i don't think it's in this case, but i don't want to mislead you, which is as  i think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody would be exonerated by one form of the insanity defense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the insanity defense. and i don't think it follows that somebody that's in that margin has a constitutional right to make up the difference, effectively, through a mens rea argument. and, otherwise, i think you  i mean, you 
were those 
there is a major dispute on that point, your honor. we presented several affidavits that showed individual teachers 
but in respect to that core position, i can understand the state's concern with the possibility of abuse. but in nelson, what the court says is it points to gomez, and gomez was a 1983 case. and there, the court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation, and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you, though in a somewhat different context. he kept bringing the cases, and every time, you know, he'd lose. then he'd think of another way of making the same point, and in your context, it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine. so we go to another. then he challenges that. then he challenges that. then he challenges that, always at the very last minute. so there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs. so why do we need something else like an absolute rule of some sort that the petitioner has to think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the future to be not painful? i mean, you don't need to put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.
i believe the language is any. well, if there are no more questions, i'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
in for a penny, in for a pound.
it does  what it  you're right it doesn't say the following. it doesn't say, and we don't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the  the concept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown to congress, to the courts, and to the administrative agencies. but what the secretary of labor did do in his report is, after identifying all of the problems that adversely affect older workers, he says, i recommend a two-pronged approach. one prong is prohibitory. it's coercive. you shall not  we'll prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment, which the secretary explained to congress, and this court last term said itself, means a  is a  is  is the use of age as the decision-making criteria. he said, separately we should have a series of programs that seek to enlarge the abilities of older workers, that seek to educate employers about the abilities of older workers through non-coercive programs. and so what this statute does  and this court has said it in several of its cases  this statute was based upon the secretary of labor's report. the secretary wrote the bill, and although congress amended it in other ways, it didn't amend any of these provisions. that this statute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a distinctly different problem, and the problem 
 is property, the revenue rule  the revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two  there are two dimensions to the property element. one is that, as i said  and if a  if a tax claim is not  has not been subject to an assessment, that whatever interest the government may have in that is not in the nature of property; it is simply in the nature of law-enforcement power to collect. they  some of these revenue rule cases talk about the power to 
i 
i would say, respectfully, your honor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not entirely inconsistent, with what this court said in granberry and caspari, dealing with the same sort of raising of affirmative defenses. from that standpoint, from a procedural standpoint, i would say that granberry and caspari are procedurally indistinct, in that this court said that it is appropriate, in these circumstances, for the court to look at affirmative defenses. obviously, they have substantive differences, which my  which counsel has pointed out, but, from a procedural standpoint, were the petitioner to prevail here, i would think this court needs to recede procedurally from granberry and caspari 
your honor, they are reviewed from a classification standpoint on an annual basis. they are reviewed from a privilege standpoint  and there's different levels within 5  on a quarterly basis and so 
 points out 
not at all, your honor. it's not that  that theory at all. in  in pennsylvania, the court accepts it and gives it judicial review and reviews it claim by claim to see if any of the exceptions apply.
you've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.
and the 
that's the 
may i ask  may i ask you a question about the alternative? if we don't follow this statute, you  you refer to state law for the correct cause  statute of limitations i guess.
i think a defendant needs to understand the nature  the basic nature and concept of mitigation. but this case provides a good example 
it's not  it's not 
do  do you think the  the materially modifier here does anything other than eliminate obviously de minimis behavior on the part of the employer?
do you want to  do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get  you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.
is the super scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?
absolutely, your honor, because first of all  first of all, with regard to citizens publishing, it is per se. secondly, with regard to quick look, look what you have. first you analyze the  as we've said  as you've said before in your decisions, first you analyze the restraint. what is it? it's a restraint directly on price. it's not covered up any way. it's not something doing something like less supply to fix the price. it's directly at the price. the second thing is, in doing that, is this restraint necessary, not less  not much  essential  is it necessary to  to get the  what you're saving on the joint venture? is it necessary to promote the objectives of the joint venture?
thank you, mr. frederick. the case is submitted.
and the  and the court of appeals of maryland said, "we're going to look at this in the legal sense, not the dictionary sense."
that's 
may i interrupt? because i'm 
who said that? excuse me. that  that description of the statute.
well, if we were to make clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six, don't you think  and as a result the aedpa restrictions don't apply, don't you think that number would increase rather dramatically?
no, but it's a totally  i cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare. it will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much  more money than the retailer is now making. he's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. you know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different. when you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.
so, you look to the state of conviction. what 
you mean life isn't a fountain? (laughter.)
justice ginsburg, the question is what is made. if making it means somehow creating, reconfiguring the precise sequence of commands 
the  the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.
if the kids look around and they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again  (laughter.)
well, but as justice breyer indicated, can't you just, for purposes of understanding the cause of action as asserted by vickie marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is valid, we will assume the will is valid? all we're saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be liable to us in tort.
they got  i mean, they didn't  they weren't held to have promised  made a commitment to remove from new york. now, clearly, in analyzing the reasons 
 too far. so is 
no, i thought  it says that you have to get your permit. you have to be compliant with state water quality standards. now, suppose a state has a nutty water quality standard. doesn't epa have some authority there to make sure that a water quality standard of a state, under the clean water act, is  makes sense?
but the theory is not necessarily bad. the, the relator has to cooperate with the government, ideally he should. and if the government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and the relator said fine, "i don't want to put competing theories before the jury, so i'll surrender my first theory and go with the government's," why should the relator be penalized for that good litigation practice? it doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint is no good or even that it might not have been proved, if the government had preferred another route.
well, in the bay area laundry case and in the reiter case, the court has acknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues. but in each of those case  cases, the court was very clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence of contrary indication by congress. and here we have a very explicit contrary indication by congress, that the statute of limitations for any civil action under section 3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section 3729 was committed. in other words, congress has opted here to establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all claims that might arise under the false claims act. and as i said before, that serves the purposes of the false claims act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's alternative. as we have pointed out, many state statutes of limitations, assuming that one can determine which one applies of the many that might be offered, are much shorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam action. as a practical matter, then an employee might be forced to split their claims. if they split their claims, any number of adverse consequences follow. first, they could find themselves barred from bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the united states by the public disclosure bar of the false claims act. the eleventh circuit has a rule that says that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata. so in the eleventh circuit, apparently they could be barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action. the disclosures in the course of the wrongful termination of retaliation claim action would, of course, alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any government investigation.
when it  when one of the  the last he had heard from the officers was, "no, he doesn't want to talk. he already asked for a lawyer. we cannot talk to him now."
well, let's take those points. the answer is you make the change that congress says in the statute you should make. and so when you have an 
well, what do you think? because i would think that if you're going to answer that question yes, you are saying that not even the court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness among different defendants in respect to sentencing.
yes. the first amendment rights are very important.
 that are just verboten for all purposes and schedule 2 substances, but the regulation of federal controlled substances in the harrison act has always focused on drugs that have some lawful medical uses but are 
yeah, but that's because when a distributor sells to another distributor, he is not acting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor.
 can i ask  i'm still a little puzzled about the posture of the case.
on  on this  on this record, we would have a due process claim for twofold. we submit that the  that the error is in the attempt not necessarily the success, and particularly in the 
but it was not known at the time that he was incompetent. and  and therefore, that could not have been the reason that he was not being tried. the reason he was not being tried was that the  that there was pending before the judge the inquiry into whether he was competent.
you agree with judge niemeyer's comment in the fourth circuit case, i take it.
that's  i  i suspect that's the typical case in  in capital cases. mr. rhines is currently

yes.

 where  where dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?
well, the  the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute states that 
no. it's  justice stevens, it's what the right is. the constitutional right is a right against being required to  to engage in compelled speech.
all of them? you mean, like the research tools problem?
and you're saying it means discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing of a contract with somebody else. and you're saying that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even though the contract was with  was with somebody else, you have a claim under this language of 1981.
no, your honor. we believe that even under turner 
not necessarily, your honor. it  there are 
well, but you should make it more specific for us. you say general due process. how does that work in this case? i want to know whether or not i can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a button, a piece of clothing. what's the test that i use?
so it seems to me it's very  very close to your situation.
and every plan that i know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.
it, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils. and i guess what we are interested in here is not school districts; they are not a thing  they are a thing of a kind, but we are interested in students, real people who get money. and so that it, that it  it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not a bad thing, because what we are really interested in are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.
i think that maybe it's possible, in some cases, as a sanction for bad-faith conduct. conceivably  i'm not sure where that would come from  but if he fails to present the claim in a  in a way that it can be addressed, he has to  he can't come to federal court until he presents it to them in a way in which it at least could have been addressed.
see, what i'm getting at is whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical problems that you raise are present. and they're awful. i don't deny them. i mean, they're right there in the statute, it foresees them. so i wonder, is there any difference in this case from every case where the remand is erroneous?
they were filed actually as part of the state collateral review proceedings. they were filed with the habeas. and it appears that they are at the ja 6 and 8.
that's true. and even more fundamentally, the united states breached the contract. the district didn't do anything wrong. why would we sue the district when the united states cut off the water and doubled the charge?
that's correct, and  and the police are not illegally on the premises and my daughter 
right, right, yes.
no, it doesn't. this was a  this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of  of respects, but it 
what is the circumstance? all you said here is there coule be a pre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.
no, he was  he was not employed at the time. if you look at his page 18, as you point out, it says at the bottom the income given is estimated based on a new job which is about to start. he had  he had been the principal of a company called rlm flooring, which had been closed by citizens bank. so he was, in fact, unemployed because citizens bank had taken all of the assets of the corporation and shut it down. and this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he was very concerned about finding employment so he could in fact, keep  get his mortgage current and then retain his home. official
it just seems to me in the hypothetical i put  and there's obviously a reason i put it  is there's just no causal link between the  the suppression and  and the failure to knock.
justice scalia, in most cases a knock on the door would  would be appropriate thing to do.
if  if somebody asked where this man was convicted, they'd say in a japanese court.
and i think it gets easier as more cases like this one certainly get the message out.
what is your understanding of the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?
you could not say that because if you take the information from a golden master or a stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless that continues to move and change in form, the computer will not work. the computer operates by having you press a button saying do this function. the central processing unit then says where are my instructions on how to do it. it says find them and put them in random access memory, where it is then replicated in the form of patterns of electrical charges, quite a different physical form than it exists on the hard drive. and the program counter 
the procedure i would, i would expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact with respect to whether the case had been converted or whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in official the chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an evidentiary hearing would be required. if  the fact that there was no evidentiary hearing in the particular case here, i think, i think we have to go back to recognize the fact that most issues in bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion practice. and it is my feeling that, the jurisprudence of rule 56 has to apply. if a court sees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court must schedule an evidentiary hearing. it cannot, it cannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance issue of fact. so this is why i say that, that on these two  the two particular points  and obviously, the question of whether it has been previously converted is very easy to determine. but as previously discussed, the issue of eligibility, whether the claims and the debt is within the statutory limitation, is an issue of fact that ultimately might require an evidentiary hearing.
well, on the state appeal, it's true that collins' attorney dropped the claim specifically as to juror 19. but the reason the prosecutor's strike of juror 19 is relevant is at step three of batson, this court has emphasized that the duty of the trial judge to determine purposeful discrimination requires an examination of all the relevant circumstances.
and then you have a future congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute that does not use the magic words. i thought our cases held that, in such a situation, the will of the future congress prevails 
it's a convoluted question. okay. so there's no issue under the spending clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys' fees?
true.
 know what it 
i think that discussion of the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been produced under roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that  you know  that was not that old. it hadn't worked out as well as we maybe expected it would. but i don't think it was for the purpose of showing that it always produces unreliable results.
 mail apparatus.
 against a third party. what  what happens under  that doesn't destroy it, rule 14. right?
there's many issues, but also it was being careful and it was being very methodical. and it went through this and it went through this record. that court went through true this record, more than 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than 100 witnesses. and it was on that 
yes. and again, that was 
but 5 is subject to the submerged lands act and the submerged lands act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit. and then  see, that's

it would be very complicated, your honor, given the fact that district courts often issue rulings in unpublished decisions as well.
it's  justice ginsburg, it is the receipt that triggers the liability for the tax. there is a  an exemption that may be taken in connection with sales to the united states, and that's a part of a massive quid pro quo operation, where fuel is sold to the united states, and the united states pays the state back substantially all of the tax that

in martin, in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another federal district court, could the second federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court; i'm not getting into it? or, or does that district court have, have to go through the motion again?

how can we possibly sever (1) and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?
in which case you shouldn't be making this argument because it applies only to state courts.
let me explain why i think it would be imprudent for the court to resolve it and then explain why i think it's fair to say that the court didn't consider one way or the other principles of preclusion in application of the full faith and credit act in williamson county.
and  and what we would be looking for is evidence that  that such a actual loss occurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the marketplace.
thank you, mr. hungar. the case is submitted.
then you're  you're contradicting the premise.
sure. i'd be happy to 
where  where is that noun?
it is a lesser remedy  than the one requested, that was

well, that's exactly right, justice scalia. and congress has spoken to this precise issue in the dta. whatever was the question about applying 
 if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.
what is the  as a practical matter, though, what is the great burden on the plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual defendants first if they're concerned about the judgment bar?
is there any reason to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found the same evidence?
well, in this case they knew about it, didn't they?
if the aggravators are not outweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the death penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but that you shall impose the death penalty. this is the duty you were sworn to uphold. shows command. it means must. that's  is that the type of instruction 
is it  you just  on your list, i had the impression, but tell me if i'm right or wrong, that there's a specific statute dealing with abortion clinics now, though there wasn't when this case began.
 came out, would that be a discharge in 
so after the settlement, i take it arkansas would  still would have had the right to  to pursue its claim in the litigation, or am i wrong about that?
that's right.
no, but, are you 
and if we did  if we did interpret 1332(c) that way, there wouldn't be any favoritism for national banks.
well, not so much maybe input, but so that they can  they can resolve the program  the problem within the institution, and not have to come to the courts.
so there absolutely would be standing.
that is correct.
she was certainly  she was certainly wrong on the law. when she  when the gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a suspect category, and she seemed to be  her notion was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an equal number of men and women. and it was  she seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age too. i agree with you she didn't withdraw it, but was  the reasonable explanation was we don't want too many young people here. so i'm going to allow some, but i want older people to dominate. but the gender  she had to be told by the judge batson applies to gender. that  that seemed  that seemed strange to me that  that 2 years after, she would not know.
that's correct.
do 
i think the duty to  to notify the assignee would be true insofar as proceeding against the third party is concerned. and to the extent that the notification to the assignee would serve any purpose in maximizing the total recovery, there probably is a duty, but notice to the assignee here would have been absolutely of no value insofar as the common interests against the defendants were concerned.
well, that wouldn't be true if you amended the statute though, would it? if you  if they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult, you could still impose the death penalty on these other 12 people who haven't been tried.
do you have any idea how often this  this sort of situation comes up where there's an alleged violation of the act and then a denial by the district court of a pretrial motion to dismiss?
ms. mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.
it would, your honor.
yes, but if it is found there is no jurisdiction, then the party cannot have relied on that to suspend 
well, you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase. it could be you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when your car is in for repair for some reason. that's not an increase.
and that's correct, justice souter.
now, can we  can they prove this? $60. $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the gold. it turns out that gold never existed and they knew it. the stock is not selling for $60 anymore. it's selling for $200. they found platinum. no one expected it. all right. they want to prove maybe it is selling for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have sold for $250. can they do it?
 mr. chavis did.
i still don't understand how they proceed. does he have to bring  can he go right into court on the constitutional claim even if the statutory claim has to go through the grievance procedure?
do you have an action 
so he does not have an absolute right in all cases to convert, then.
your honor, if we 
this is a very different statutory scheme. this is designed to address the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous complaints that result in the fact that meritorious complaints can be overlooked. we've got a haystack in a needle problem here. and if you allow the action to continue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number of filing of claims that as you say should not have been brought.
and my only point is, since this court clearly said it was dealing with 117 of the acts, and clearly did not mention the four counts of violence and threats of violence under the hobbs act 
what  what is the  where  where is the place in what the judge  when did this eye-rolling take place? i can't figure it out.
okay. so this is a third consequence of the jurisdictional issue.
yes.
our key position is that before you get to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question 
but still there was a official finding in congress and there wasn't a finding in the nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the finding being in congress and not in the nebraska legislature  what kind of legal difference does that make?
but you  in any case, i don't want to prolong this unduly. you're saying that there would have been some equitable claim and some equitable remedy with respect to the $75,000 that  that a  a court could have taken cognizance of the day before the settlement.
we're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. and you are treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is forum non conveniens. but 1406 is wrong venue and, as you know, in the goldlaw case this court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue. now, why isn't the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist?
but  well, you keep saying that, but that policy is  can be vindicated by using doctrines other than consent. and you want us to  i think you want us to say, i think we have to say, that there's a general social expectation that the person who wants entry overrides the person who doesn't.
in the district court he didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the scope of his employment? i thought he had. maybe he hadn't. i thought he had, but i'll ask him that.
and that's a  with exigent circumstances.
what is a functionally regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.
justice kennedy, in terms of the  the size of  of the bloodstains, it was significant to the extent that it bears upon the probative value of the testimony of charles scott when he says  when he said he saw what he thought might be stains. as a simple matter of fact, this  the jeans were stained with a number of substances, not just blood, and a number of witnesses, including the trial prosecutor himself, described the bloodstains as actually so small that they were difficult to detect by the human eye. the second part of your question, justice kennedy, yes. that evidence was available. and our position is that it  that goes actually to the substance of our constitutional ineffective assistance of counsel claim. trial counsel had in his possession  or his expert certainly had in his possession the photograph that showed an entire tube of blood missing. therefore, he had evidence that there was something wrong with the blood. trial counsel was actually concerned about this blood. he filed a pretrial motion to suppress this blood evidence. here's trial counsel with evidence that blood is missing. he knows it's a critical issue in the case and he failed to go out and hire someone like the assistant chief medical examiner for the state of tennessee who came into federal court and testified as to the  that the source of this blood was, in fact, that empty tube.
i have one 
 our position. and we, respectfully, would argue that that's not an appropriate way to conduct the deterrence analysis. even just on the terms of deterrence, we think that suppression here would be a disproportionate remedy. and that's because, as this court has repeatedly recognized, the officers already have an incentive, inherent in the nature of the circumstances, to announce and delay some period of time before entry. now, there may be 
and in  and in the circumstances that the court's test has been announced in turner, that's certainly within the ambit of a right which the prison authorities might properly exercise.
in  in this case, the artuz problem is only an argument, and i  we're not even accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that the court made a mistake of law. a mistake of law is not a fundamental breakdown in our system. it does not mean the court didn't act as a court. this court reverses in  or vacates in about 75 percent of its cases. it doesn't mean all the lower courts were not operating as courts as we recognize them as at the same level of fraud. it's routine to have mistakes of law 
because of employed and domestic employment versus 
but not in 1790.
i mean, first, certainly if congress had said with absolute clarity that district court review of claims like this is precluded, we would defend the statute as constitutional. second, i agree with you that the fairest reading, the most likely interpretation of congress' intent is that claims of this nature  that is, complaints about aspects of the employment relationship that don't rise to the level of personnel actions. the fairest reading of congress' intent is that such suits would be precluded. however, this court in a number of prior decisions has required something more than that before inferring that congress has barred all judicial review of a colorable constitutional claim.
if 
no, it's not. it's a different case for two reasons, justice stevens. first of all, because it's content discriminatory. it's not saying the  it's not saying you  we limit the agency fee to the nonchargeable, the non-germane, or to the purposes that are germane to collective bargaining. the state can permissibly do that because it's making 
exactly.
well 
it's  it's a longstanding rule of statutory construction that congress' intent is best found in the language that congress actually puts into the statute. and as we pointed out in the brief, there were previous versions of this act which included experts' fees which did not make its way to the final version approved by both the  the senate and the house.
okay. well, as to the first question, the explanation that you just provided clearly requires the federal courts, when there's some indication from the state court that it might have been untimely, to look into it. and that was the very problem with what the ninth circuit did in that case. it said "on the merits and for lack of diligence." so, to presume that that was just on the merits, that's flatly wrong. you'd need to do some further investigation. in light of the context of what's happening in california, however, when the state court says nothing, there has to be some process by which the federal court can make a decision as to what that means, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied on the merits and the state court thought it was timely, it would be extremely invasive for the federal court to re-review the case, potentially come to a different conclusion, and, we would suggest, dramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners exhaust their remedies in california, because now you're developing a federal body of law that may be very different in deciding what's substantial and what's reasonable than california did. and so, what the ninth circuit, i believe, did in this case was look to context and come up with the presumption that was most reasonable in light of what's going on. so, the first thing that is relevant, from a 
so it's 
well, would we  would our  would our nose count be today or would our nose count be when the criminal statute was 
okay. but how do we administer it? how does anyone administer that  that kind of a test?
so that if you're the ceo of your company, and a lawyer  federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the fair credit reporting act, i need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say i don't want to hear about it, i don't want to know about it. that would not be willfully violating the statute?
is it in law 
there's no testimony that the state considered ever taking out anybody else but the people in webb county.
 for what? that's the problem. i mean, here is someone who's been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
but  but you  that's just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands. but under your theory, the corps of engineers would have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that tributary system as well. if any of that land has a deposit of  of some materials that could leach into or  or drain into the  the tributary system, which is to say any gutter, in theory, the  the federal government can regulate it all. no?
that's correct. we're not arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal. we're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a guidelines sentence. for an out of guidelines sentence there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would look and require increasingly strong reasons with the increasing degree of variance from 
no. we believe the parole statute furnishes independent authority 
justice kennedy, i think that the calderon standard should not be applied for several reasons. first, that this is a  a challenge to a rule of general application, rule 41. there is no explanation in the state's brief, and indeed their amicus concedes that  that our reading of rule 41(b) is consistent with aedpa. it is basically  reconsideration is permitted by federal law, and the only question is whether the state's interest in finality becomes somehow more significant the moment this court denies certiorari.
only on a facial challenge.
 this case is different, actually, from the one that justice breyer put, because, in this case, the california supreme court didn't say 
i mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right? what kind of affiliates did they have before they had operating subsidiaries? did they rent pool halls, or what?
 regardless of the specified reason.
well, that's precisely, justice scalia, our argument, that i don't think one can consider the abstention claim  and this is what i believe both courts below had held  you can't consider the abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits. and if you believe that the  that congress has fairly balanced the rights and are compliant with the ucmj and the like, then i don't think  then you're reaching the merits, and there's no abstention holding. so, if i could turn to the merits  the merits challenges. the first thing i'd like to discuss on  is question number 1 and whether this military commission states a charge that violates the laws of war. and we believe it doesn't, for two essential reasons. first, the only charge in this case is one of conspiracy. and conspiracy has been rejected as a violation of the laws of war for  in every tribunal to consider the issue since world war ii. it has been rejected in nuremberg, it's been rejected in the tokyo tribunals, it's been rejected in the international tribunals for rwanda and yugoslavia, and, most importantly, it's been rejected by the congress of the united states, in 1997 
 about the effects.
this  this doctrine only comes into play and is only required in cases involving a valid arrest and a  a mistake by the officer in identifying the wrong cause for the arrest. so it's an extension of the qualified  it's a  it's a  an application of the qualified immunity doctrine to say you are not protected even though you acted lawfully.
i understand that.
thank you, mr. srinivasan. mr. stock.
that is  that is an argument for the weight of considering motive rather than the relevance of the motive consideration per se.
no, your honor, because as i mentioned before, the case law in the first circuit up to this point has held that a chapter 7 debtor does not have standing to object to claims. now in the new case, in fact, the bankruptcy court 
that's correct, because  because the difficulty is once you go past that, what  what obligation you have becomes completely unknowable at that stage.
has 
it was initially alleged, but, through the course of discovery, the focus of it was a disposition memorandum, because by the time he went to the mexican-american bar association, he had already been disciplined, so there is no causation between his public speech to the mexican bar association and the disciplinary actions that were 
or  or at least it is arguably so, in which case you come back to my question. why isn't the  the eeoc's resolution of that ambiguity conclusive?
i'm not disputing that it results in additional exposure. i'm just disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their agreement to undertake the program.
no, no, no. i don't  i think it's  it may be in small part to that, justice kennedy, but i think the main point is that what their brief looked to  what the argument was was our  are adolescents cognitively different than adults. and the answer is, as we  our brief concedes, is generally no. and what was at issue in the abortion cases was competency to decide. and just as we allow the mentally retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded, isn't the issue. christopher simmons was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally retarded can be. the issue in hodgson was cognitive ability to be able to make a competent decision. and so i don't  i didn't represent the apa then and i don't now, but i don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency. in fact, the difference here goes to the factors that atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the mentally retarded  and here adolescents  are less morally capable. they are much, much less likely to be sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst. and here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even determine it, be  we could determine were in fact so depraved that they were among the worst of the worst, there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way reliably to exclude them. and it is in this respect that science i think changes. at the time of stanford, everybody on this court, of course, knew what all of us as adults intuitively know, which is that adolescents  and  and here we're talking about  i agree that when adolescence starts and when it ends is undefined. but every scientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that 16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. no one excludes them. and what we know from the science essentially explains and validates the consensus that society has already developed.
now, what does it mean?
it doesn't  it doesn't enable you to enforce your law any more rigorously than without having a requirement for a local office.
well, or the other side is going to give up.
well, mr. chief justice, i think your assumption may not be entirely correct. there's a  there's a portion from, for example, the san diego prosecutor's office decided, and i believe in the nacdl brief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to  to leave the witness off the stand because they have a better case just using the  the excited utterance type statements.
i mean  i mean the opposite. it's  it's not vehicle-specific.
the  the only question is whether this list should be taken to exclude things that are not on the list even though they would otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the word enterprise. and this court in many decisions has given congress a template. it said if you use the means/includes dichotomy, we will take that choice to be advertent and we will assume that when you use means that's intended to be exclusive; when you use includes, that's intended to be not exclusive.
where is it pending?
i thought that was  i thought their position was that that was not the standard d&e.
so is that also true if his own witness has committed the fraud?
it  it cites both, depending on what subsection it's citing. so it doesn't necessarily identify one as opposed to the other.
but to accept your answer, we've got to look into a question of california pleading law which hasn't been passed on below.
that's correct. but the regulation  552.3 defines the statutory term which only exists in the exemption, domestic service employment.
except that she is removable by election, and that is indeed what has happened. and i understand that one of the issues in the election was precisely whether this borrowing authority existed or not. and if that's the case, you have a new attorney general that presumably as an original matter would not do what the prior attorney general did.
your honor, with respect, i think that's  it would be an improper reading of segura. there was an illegal entry, in segura, that was just as necessary in order to conduct the search and obtain evidence in that case as there was at premature entry here.
are there cases in the records where it shows government overreaching or bad faith and so forth in trying to get rid of the counsel? that just doesn't happen?
but they held that the  the action simply didn't apply in  in that case. there was no  there was no recovery under the  basically it held the foreign  foreign country exception precluded the statute from applying 
that's absolutely right, and in fact there's no reason to think that such claims are particularly common. this has been the rule in effect for 20 years in the lower courts and respondent is unable to show any actual evidence that these kinds of claims are common. but much more common are instances in which an employee has no reasonable basis for filing a charge of discrimination within 180 days of the disparity.
no, your honor, because the manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits of the retailers, but the retailers when they get together obviously have a very different incentive, which is not to benefit the manufacturer.
if  if you're contracting for yourself 
these other cases that you refer to, where  that involve spending legislation, where the states go beyond what is minimally required  i suspect that they are cases where it really is an imposition on the states, and they accept it. here, the imposition is not on the states, it's on the local school districts. and very often, the interests of the local school district is quite different from the interests of the people, you know, down-state, in the state capital. i'm  i am loath to think that just because a state supreme court says that every school district in the state has to bear the burden of proof, that congress intended that to be the case. i think it's a different  a different situation, where the spending is money that's coming out of the  ultimately, out of the pocket of the school district.
would have  would have  that's correct, justice breyer.
well, no, i think my answer to that would be that we'd still be here suggesting that that's controlled. i think my answer was also that that would be a far better as-applied challenge than the one that this court has before it. and i think, you know, in  in one sense we make this point in the brief. i mean, contrasting this case with a case like mcfl i think is quite instructive. there, you're not focused on the content or intent of specific ads. you look at the organization as a whole and come up with fairly bright lines. and once you've made a determination about the organization in an as-applied challenge, you're done with the issue. here, the kind of 
well, it's clear at least that they disagreed with the finding of the district court that there had been a waiver, no?
they did not say one way or the other the first time.
well, i think that the whole point of the commerce clause was to stop these kind of 
well, we love the language. we don't have to get out of it. it says because of age. that's a reference, a traditional, conventional reference 
correct. and so we 
if they gave them independence and if there were some relationship with the joint venture 
that was a case i dissented in, wasn't it?
that's correct.
 guiding principle.
 had no problems. but it's not how it reads.
well, i think in past cases the court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines. and the most compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at this particular time. and you know, it's coming from a judicial officer, it's not coming from someone miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10 days run in connection with the case. because in civil litigation you are not given any specific time to do an act. criminal cases are a little bit different. you are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed in connection with a case. you do not have in civil, when you get your final order  you know you have 30 days to do it.
so, you think  you think the oregon supreme court might well come out that way, if it wished, although not resting on the eighth amendment?
why?
i'm saying that, in this context, it isn't  it isn't effective, your honor.
but at the same  exactly that  that avoids the problem. at exactly the same time, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest. why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be subject to commerce clause analysis and that would fall, that if the government wants to do this the government's going to do it the way the government's doing it in your case, it's going to be a 100 percent government. if it doesn't, it's protectionism.
20,000 might make me shudder. but we got one. (laughter.)
i mean, i think that may be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive.
exactly.
congress  congress considered all this when it made its policy decision to defer to the states to address this. the states have the ability and the will to  to protect their own waters from pollutants of any kind. and as i indicated earlier, all the states have antipollution regulations.
do we have a return of a verdict saying, "we find these factors in equipoise"?
i hope so. [laughter.]
the kaul 
even  even if the warning specifically covered that design defect?
right.
yes.
you're assuming that the  that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good. why do you assume that?
the  the problem i have with  with the government's case and with the respondent's case is that  it's really the obverse of what justice ginsburg said. their problem is that they would recast everything as a warning.
but it's not dismissal of the jury. we'll have to make up some other line. right?
it  it would be in error, i believe, your honor.
ms. hollander, may i just, on this point  it's the same question i raised with mr. kneedler. we're talking about a preliminary injunction. your side, i think, said, "go for the permanent injunction. we have a lot more to put in." the presentation on the treaty was rather thin, below. i take it from mr. kneedler's argument that he's saying the preliminary injunction, or not, is really the thing. if the government wins, no preliminary injunction. there's not going to be any show for a permanent injunction. but, on your side of it, what more would you be putting in? let's say you prevail at the preliminary injunction stage. would you then say, "see, judge, now you can enter a permanent injunction"? or you  would you be putting in more evidence? and if so, what kind?
the court always has the authority to have evidence taken to determine its own jurisdiction. that's routinely done by district courts.
then maybe i can see if i could answer your question. mr. caballes in this case indeed had an expectation of privacy. when he was asked by the police officer in this case if he can consent to the search, he said no. he did not want that law enforcement officer looking in 
that was a term of the plan that it  you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?
even in salerno, the  the  this court held that in a preventive case, the bail  the bail reform statute still requires, as a basic modicum of due process, that you give the person the reason 
well, if that's  if that's the relief you get, then the door would be open to successive different 1983 actions every time the state comes up with  with a new protocol. whereas, if what the  if  if the trial court  if you succeed at this stage, if we say, yes, you're  you're properly in court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial court, in fact, awards not the injunction that you asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this person until a constitutional protocol has been proposed and accepted by the court, then everything will get resolved in this one action, as you suggest. so would  would you consent to  as it were, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that the injunction will be in such a form that everything can get resolved in this one case?
well, justice scalia, i think it's a difference suggested by this court's cases, and they do make an important distinction between the distribution of money outside the government where the spending itself is the injury and what this court has termed the incidental expenditure of money in the context of an executive branch activity that itself is alleged to violate the establishment clause.
thank you, ms. maynard. mr. brunstad.
 the question.
that certainly hasn't been my experience and certainly not in my county.
but we didn't hold  but we didn't hold that.
what was the section you cited?
"who put this mail here? this is  this is  mail shouldn't be here." i mean, you have  a simple way of looking at it is, you have two things going on at the same time in the car, in the vehicle. you've got the regular activity of driving, and you've got the transmission of mail. but when you come to the porch, you have one activity, and one activity only.
china comes in 
i think it can, but it raises some interesting potential hypothetical questions, what about listening to the voice of martin luther king junior, conscientious objection and so forth. i don't think the court needs to stray into those areas because here we have a written policy which does in fact respond to concerns about the exercise of standardless discretion.
but the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute.
yes. the reason is where there's a violent situation, things can change in seconds. i mean, it can turn deadly in seconds. they don't have time. even though a telephonic warrant would certainly be a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's not speedy enough where punches are being thrown. i mean, it can turn deadly, one blow could give someone a concussion or even rupture a spleen.
well, i mean it seems to me that the whole argument that you're making as to ford is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic  you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.
well, i'm not sure it is in a special sense. what the federal circuit has done is has, it has attributed controlling significance to what is in most cases at best a factor, and in fact is nothing more than a legal argument about the preemptive effect of prior art. the motivation debate in this case is all about what is the preemptive legal effect of the asano reference. it either invalidates the claim 
no, i am not, your honor.
but 
 what the rule is.
that is correct. and  and i would just like to go on and say one other thing, and that is, this court has written how many hundreds i don't know, but hundreds of cases articulating nuances  and  and i've learned how remarkable they are, the nuances  of law under 1332 and under what amounts to a case within  it's incredible how complex the law that this court has spelled out is under 1332. our view of the statute is that that body of law has been preserved and it's been preserved in two places. it has been preserved in the first clause of 1367(a), which is really all that's at issue right here, and it's also been  been preserved in the last clause of 1367(b) which says that  that as to the list of enumerated exceptions  in essence, (b) says if you've got a case within the original jurisdiction, then it says, with regard to plaintiffs' claims against parties joined under 14, 19, 20, and 24 and with regard to claims brought by persons to be joined under 19 or 24, then you don't have supplemental jurisdiction if to do so would be inconsistent with the requirements of jurisdiction under 1332. what does that mean? that means that those excepted claims may not come in if they could not have been brought in the case originally without destroying original jurisdiction under 1332. it can't possibly mean, as our opponents i think read it, that the only time you have supplemental jurisdiction over these claims is when you already have 1332 jurisdiction over these claims. that isn't supplemental jurisdiction. it would make absolutely no sense to read the statute that way. so how do we read it? we read it to say if these are claims whose presence in the case at the beginning would have destroyed the anchor that gets us into court, which is a case under 1332, then the whole thing goes out the window. and furthermore, i would say  and again, this is not an easy point to spell out in all of its nuances, but at any point in the case, which will not be many and won't be often  but at any point in the case where this court's cases would say that you just lost jurisdiction under 1332  and i say that's not often because basically there's a time of filing rule and there are many, many, as you all know better than i  there are many nuances as to what exceptions exist to that and what don't. but the bottom line is if the case falls out of 1332 jurisdiction, such as when the clever plaintiff tries to join a rule 20 compadre to come in and bring a nondiverse claim, goodbye. you're out of court because 
well, of course, that would not be a fourth amendment claim.
and  and i think the reason it's not right is because that just shows that there's no live controversy right now. that's a controversy that might happen in the future.
thank you, mr. olson.
it could be, because the statute of limitations could have run. so it depends. sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. but my basic question here, isn't this a matter for the rules committees rather than for the sixth circuit to go off on its own?
so  so i just want to make sure i know where we stand. you're saying that the assumption i was making, that under mississippi law, in the absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the jury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the death penalty, but an option of life with or without parole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a  as a fact about mississippi law.
no. actually our primary position on that is that he was in a public place at a public event among public people 
what?
there also are due process allegations, and i'm not sure i even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged. but i would like you to address both and to tell us, first of all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis from your perspective.
is that so? if the employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the united states is not a party, just the federal employee, but it's staying in federal court under this pendent jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be entitled to a jury trial?
there may be ways this could be arranged at the second level, through 
then you explain that to me?
i have to interrupt you. what is the fourth amendment violation?
i 
 you've been debating?
well, isn't that what we squarely held in bishop?
no. no.
okay.
your honor, counsel for co-defendant, felicia brown, presented just such a defense and she was acquitted. she presented the defense that melvin smith did not shoot christopher robinson, but if melvin 
well, to begin with, that may be why petitioners' position here certainly was not reckless and the ninth circuit erred. but we do think that the statutory language read as a whole supports this. it could be a denial of a particular term in an insurance contract. but you have to look at  it's important to understand you look 
 realistic.
okay, that's the end of it. right?
well, don't you think that the federal circuit may have focused too much on generic drug applications? do you think it was right about that?
mr. howe, would you explain to me how the state has proved intentional  not intentional killing, but of a police officer? if that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police officer, how does the state meet its burden on a police officer if the testimony on the other side is, "i did not understand that this human that i killed was a police officer"?
i don't see that 
my point is that the due process  due process clause does address the conduct at question, which is the requirement that exculpatory material be turned over to the defendant. and so, the question is that the employee would be put in a position where he would  where he would be instructed not to perform what he understood to be a constitutional violation. i think most civil service laws, most ethical rules, would take care of it. and, as i mentioned, the federal whistle-blower statute, in 2302(b)(9), i think it is, has a provision that protects employees who refuse 
it's strict scrutiny if it's not the government acting as the speaker, and the government is acting here as 
i'm  i'm a supervisor, and the employee files a complaint against me as a supervisor. thereafter, i am not as friendly to that employee as i used to be. i don't smile and say, good morning, how are you, as i used to. all right? (laughter.)
well, whether you call it a flexible rightness doctrine or you develop the doctrine in a way that is very forgiving 
you would require  if  if a defendant is on his second choice and he's filed an affidavit saying, you know, the guy did a great job. i can't think of a way he would have done anything differently. i was convicted. i'm perfectly happy with his strategy, but i didn't get my first choice. you would still require reversal of the conviction in that case.
don't  don't you think the framers were aware of the fact that although there were law enforcement abuses, raleigh's case and so on, there were also abuses every day of the week on the part of people who gave false testimony because they had grudges against the defendant? do you think that was totally out of the minds of the framers so as to support the distinction that  that as a general rule you were suggesting?
yes, your honor. the 
no, your honor. the  the opinion is not made public. in fact, the statute precludes it from being made  made a part of the record. the last sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page 3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs that such report shall be reviewed by the tax court. and that's a very important point. congress has mandated by statute essentially the same procedure that the tax court follows here.
 punishable. the conduct is punishable, not 
so by articulating that the election integrity is a purpose, the washington supreme court should not be understood as excluding the protection of the non-member workers' interests?
yes.
now, what does that mean?
which  when they will be calculable. you're saying it's hard to calculate them into the future. you want the district court to calculate what the future damages will be and say, we think the damages will be this. here, take your money, and you, god bless you, go continue to violate the patent.
because if it was one body of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of water, it was bad, right?
thank you, mr. cruz. mr. garre.
absolutely, your 
mr. phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence. there was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury." that was the only instruction objected to, because the refusal to give that instruction. but you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made.
right.
well, under  under a pure advisory system  and i think your honor is addressing the cross-reference in this matter  in a purely advisory system, the guidelines were calculated correctly in mr. rita's case, because under a purely advisory system, the district court could look at that cross-reference, understand that it came about from uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it. but by not doing so in this case, and that cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range, then this case may very well be unconstitutional because of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.
in other words, i'm trying to understand. you don't know what your position is 
 mescaline.
i don't know if there isn't a factual question here. i mean, i thought justice scalia, if it were to be up to him, did take into account official commentaries to treaties. but maybe he doesn't. anyway, i take them into account. and i  and in respect to that, i read this as saying, specifically, that the plants  it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal  and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains dmt.
when you say more, in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change. and when you have an initial application you have to figure out what is the baseline in order to determine whether there has been an increase or an adverse action. and you and the solicitor general just assert that the baseline in that situation is the best possible rate that you can get, but i don't understand where that comes from.
they just have to say orally, i wish you would reconsider that? because if that's, if that's all you're arguing, i don't see anything to be gained by  by such a holding. it doesn't tell you  you know, this is a suit against a number of large corporations, nationwide businesses, thousands of employees. and on this complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, where, when, any of that. i can understand that you're saying that does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense. but if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all right so long as they said orally. i mean  forget about it.
but what do we do with the case 
 is  is an ad of  an obviously sham ad. the problem that we're dealing with 
counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and i  earlier you told me one had. which one in particular?
actually, justice scalia, we believe that section, section 760 accomplishes both purposes. the overall intent of the initiative was as i stated found by the state supreme court, but clearly from the plain language of section 760 
well, the only thing that the ninth circuit held was that the definition of a theft offense in california is broader than the generic definition of theft. all of these arguments that are being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling is supported. i don't know why they wouldn't be considered subsumed under the ninth circuit's decision.
why  why is the defense attorney in a better position to explain the  the motives of the prosecutor than the prosecutor?
i don't think so, your honor. in fact, as mr. olson pointed out, the k-marts of the world began during the fair trade era.
well, if it 
yes.
that's true, justice breyer, but what i'm saying is, that it's one thing to be able to persuade the jury through cross-examination, that that is more  not more likely than not. it's quite another thing to persuade the jury in that kind of situation that that defense is not true beyond a reasonable doubt.
thank you, mr. collins. mr. roberts?
well, the only reason for delaying it is obviously workload. and you don't want to get all briefs due within a short period of time, once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular case, because you have time limits for getting the record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of appeals going out  not in this court, but you know there were a number of appeals going on. and my normal practice is you know, file your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable appeals time.
 you know 
that may be hearsay. that may all be hearsay.
well, the government conceded in williams that 7426 was not available to ms. williams there because she had only been subjected to a lien, not a levy. so the remedies the government was pointing to in that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the quiet title action and a discretionary 
 they would be giving up the right that you claim you don't want them to have.
wasn't that a summary judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before? the matsushita decision?
all right, suppose he did, he believed there  it's an alien, which is not immoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from mars. i don't know about the morality of that, but  [laughter.]
 because 
 two dealers within 10 miles of each other, customers frequently go to both dealers to check out  to get the lowest price. dealer a gets 10 percent discount routinely; dealer b, 20 percent discount routinely. over a period of time, would there be a violation of the robinson-patman act?
is it just before the letter "b" on 14a?
and then he lost his representation when he came to the federal court?
and as i recall, the trial court did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence but for the fact that you had to exclude some of it because that there was no exception to the hearsay rule. didn't he say that?
not in  not here, because, as, i think, both courts below indicated, this case, and his challenge, falls very much like abney versus united states. this is a challenge to the lawfulness of the underlying tribunal and the charge that's against him. indeed, this court, in quirin, heard, as its first question, does the charge state a violation of the laws of war? that was the first thing it said had to be asked. so, i think the  what we are doing is applying nothing more than the settled practice that has always been the case with respect to military commissions. and it  in  the public interest here, again, just as in quirin, i think, requires some limits placed on military commissions, justice alito, because, otherwise, if the government's position is taken as the final word, it'll give the president the ability to essentially create that blank check, for years on end, render a final decision at some point, and then that final decision will then be subject to the truncated review procedures in the dta, which i don't think is what congress intended when they changed the language of the bill. rather, i think what they did was intend that this court would decide the basic  apply the basic structural limits on military commissions that have always applied.
well, that's all very nice, but congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not. it laid down some textual conditions in the statute. and unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.
 and then the  you know, the incarcerated individual can come forward with excuses and say that, "california would make an exception to the 60-day rule for this," and we're back where we were.
no, your honor. i just think it would be dangerous proposition for this court to endorse that line of argumentation but even leaving that aside, it's not justified here on the facts. and this patent is a good example. no one is suggesting that claims 1 through 3 are invalid; the problem here is that claim 4 sweeps so broadly, so much broader than what the applicant in fact invented, that it sweeps in obvious manifestations.
i would not. i  i'm not  i'm not endorsing the motivation. what i'm  what i'm saying is what is 
no. until there is some use of official authority that affects that individual, you're not discriminating. that's a  that's a personal matter between you and the individual.
that's right.
all right. so then i doubt  then again i'm left at sea. i don't know how often that happens or is dangerous. so if i think that this is really a statistical question, and i think maybe it is  and the government is in the best position, they have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over there. so what about a presumption against the government? in a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a statistical question, and the government doesn't have official any statistics?
no.
justice ginsburg, this court has never held that an appeal is required to give collateral estoppel effect. therefore, on remand, the court could  the madison county state court could give collateral estoppel effect. in fact, i expect petitioners would argue precisely that. and no decision of this court stands as a barrier to that. the court would have to change preclusion law to say that the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an approval. i agree with you, your honor, that it can be taken into account by a court, but it does not 
that might well be, but this is 
justice souter, the 
the end of the statute doesn't say that. the end of that provision says sever a provision.
if  if it turns out that the party is indispensable under rule 19.
a fortiori, we have a lot more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our jurisdictional statute under certiorari. why does it make any more sense for habeas purposes to insist that he await the final sentence before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, namely the conviction?
and there often does, i guess.
so at  at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.
it does for an out of range sentence, justice souter. i think that for a sentence within the range, the judge's statement that i have considered the guidelines range and i think it's appropriate does explain why that judge has given the sentence that he's given. it's consistent with the statute and it's consistent with the constitution. now when 
yes.
 your honor, is going to vary. but there's no indication 
that's  that's appendix 4a.
 three-part rule, as justice scalia says. there's just a two-part rule.
that's actually a rather interesting question i don't really know the answer to. the idea is that you can't find an analogous private person. we might have to write something about that. you could say  you  there always is an analogous private person. it's impossible to think of an example. the other extreme, you have the ninth circuit, which could  which says as long as the government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate. i would think that was almost certainly wrong. but what is the right way to go about it? are there such people, or aren't there?
what about having a  a plan that was put in place by the legislature instead of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?
that was the decision that congress made.
 that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.
is my understanding correct that, on your reading, state class actions of less than 50 parties are also left unpreempted?
i think we're  i think it's safe.
i think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same. i think congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the seventh amendment right, but the court doesn't need to go that far in this particular case because i think the inferences that we are asking the court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any 
well, but every evidentiary problem, the  the root of the problem is not the inability of the  or the unwillingness of the primary victim to testify. i mean, that's what makes intimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because you have to get the  if  if the intimidation is successful, the witness to testify about the  the crime is unavailable and unwilling to do so.
okay. thank you.
thank you, counsel. mr. fisher, you have four minutes remaining.
but  but when you say damages that can be proven, the only damages you  you insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target and that it  it insulted you. it  it was  you know. that's the only damage you require. so you're saying that every  every minority employee of all of the companies with whom gm, or whoever it is didn't do business, would automatically have a cause of action.
i don't think so, because, as the court of appeals said, that this court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. the money has to be central  the money that's being challenged has to be central to the violation. just as you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast 
you don't have to run the business in order to assure that, do you?
but  but the question is the motivation for his decision to bring the case.
 "letting the people out earlier than they otherwise would" 
that's defined in 921(a)(33), your honor. it's specifically limited. now, here we are. a person who beats his wife in england can have a gun in this country, but a person who commits a business regulatory offense in germany can't. it makes no sense. the  it  it's a very clear statement by congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence  they're only intending it to be a state or federal crime.
i 
but does the  does the statute  is that the only place we would look to decide whether safety is the only consideration for the fda?
no.
well, just as this court may display in the courtroom itself, moses with the ten commandments amongst law givers, doesn't mean that that is the only way the ten commandments 
well 
well, again, your honor, we think that transaction is essentially identical to numerous transactions that take place every day out in the real world where  where taxpayers retain professional services in exchange for a commission or a percentage of the income that's generated.
that isn't what they said here. i mean, they were dealing with a zone within which they operated, and it was only when the numbers got to the outer limits that they said, okay, we're going to use a racial criterion to prevent anything more, any more extreme disparity.
right.
how could they do that? you mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?
like what? i thought it was just heat?
why is there a less worthy historical tradition to be honored in a defendant's choice of his own counsel?
do your best. (laughter.)
of course, all of the concerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by injunctive relief. you don't necessarily need damages.
you know, i mean, that's  that's a problem with marshall, texas, not with the patent law. i mean, maybe  maybe we should remedy that problem.
is the kind of thing i was explaining why it would be ripe i think  is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in florida?
and justice breyer, my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you  had it been better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information, then you had an adverse action.
without being flippant, your honor, i think that the conferees thought they had put it in the statute. remember, this statute was passed back in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th congress that enacted this provision, the word cost did not have the term-of-art meaning that was later ascribed to it in this court's opinion in casey.
no. no. and, you know, we had a 10-day trial. we had numerous witnesses here. the  shrink had been decided. i mean, there was  everything was before the court to consider the  the matter. and so, you know, they had their chance at  at proof. and  and in the numerous witnesses, they made their best case. they could not identify one single politician in vermont that was  that anyone would  would claim was corrupted in any way by a contribution  by contributions under $1,000. they could not name one single incumbent politician in vermont that neglected any specific duty that he or she had.
no, justice scalia. he would have to be charged with the subsequent crime.
if there's just a reasonable doubt on the issue 
it could be selling to minors, but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed premises, where you are selling outside the proper hours of sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system 
my answer is no. (laughter.).
why?
i thought they did it by reason of a judgment of a court 
justice stevens, i  i would respectfully disagree. we believe that the  the beck issue is just with this question. you have a choice of guilt and death penalty or acquittal. this question that they're raising is conviction, not death penalty, or acquittal. and those are separate issues.
what about 10?
i'm not aware of any.
well, can there not be a case where it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the  the judge's mistaken ruling on a disqualification motion didn't have any effect on the outcome?
yes, well.
so the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.
so you're saying the word expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by counsel, which of course would be normally reimbursable.
i read the text several times.
what about the fifth circuit said that comparing rand's testimony  that that was in line with mazza's. the fifth circuit seems to recognize that those two were closely comparable.
we would agree that the fact that the president has acted underscores the point made by both texas and the united states, that the responsibility for determining the remedy to the avena judgement is found in the political branches. and the fact that the president is acting underscores this, that there is no precedent for an icj judgement being judicially enforceable. indeed, respondent is aware of no country in the world that accords binding effect to icj judgements in their own domestic courts. and 
does this case involve anything more than the enforcement of an in personam tort judgment if you are to win?
i think 
it was. petitioners 
but if he  if it's part of his job to speak publicly, then he has no  things that are said publicly in the performance of official responsibilities have no first amendment protection?
the parole officer was walking along the street, saw this guy, and said, "i'm going to search you."
but i don't agree with that you were saying or you do agree with that, i know. the  but the  the question that i would have is, is there anything the other way? i mean, in duncan, you know, i was dissenting and the thing that sort of moved me is i couldn't imagine congress really cared about this. i mean, what they do is they want to have you file within a year. and they say, well, but if you filed within a year and you're in state court, we don't care anymore. you're being  if you file in the wrong state court, you're tolled. we don't really care once you're proceeding. and now, however, if you go in  into federal court by mistake instead of state court by mistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis. some judges will get you back in on time. other judges won't. is there anything in the history or anywhere  i  i'm interested in the history from your point of view, as much as the other. is there anything that suggests that congress cared about that?
that's right. but the kansas supreme court, in the kleypas case, examined the kansas statute  which, by the way, is unique to kansas; no other state in the country has a statute like this, and this will affect no state outside of kansas  they examined this statute in great detail, and they 
no. spanking of a child would not. there's no indication under most circumstances of an intent to injure or abuse. now, of course, if there are circumstances that would suggest abuse, then officers could go in.
but i didn't understand ms. perales' argument to concern section  district 25 at all.
no, not at all.
that's not this case, your honor, because our board asserts a different compelling interest. the compelling interest asserted by the michigan law school was viewpoint diversity. a different kind of  it's a byproduct of that. this court asserts an interest in  this board, i'm sorry, asserts an interest in racial integration and we believe that there are compelling benefits from racial integration and that this board provides them to all students, both black and white.
that doesn't make any sense to me. does it depend on his intent, whether or not he intended to be a truant that afternoon?
that's right. and  and if  if employees were shifted around for one reason or the other, then i still think it would be unlikely to be a material change in their responsibilities when they went 
we're not talking, just  we're not talking about a numerical equipoise. i  there's three aggravators and three mitigators, in equipoise. and the  presumably, the individual jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate to the mitigating factors. they can find all three aggravators met, and say, "well, i still think, under factor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death."
thank you, counsel. ms. millett.
uh-huh.
it said he was speaking as a  that seemed to the court to be important to its decision.
well, it's  in california, every inmate gets parole. it's a matter of law. it's not a privilege  in morrissey against brewer. the court  in other cases, the court rejected the rights privilege distinction anyway.
would you agree there is a knock-and-announce requirement 
if that were the only way to prove an attempted burglary within a state, if that would be  that would be the requirement, the legal requirement that you have to put the ladder against the house and that's an element of the offense, that to me would be a much closer call; but still, under the analysis that we have provided the court with the russello presumption, it should not qualify. but it is a closer case. whereas categorically when you look at attempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the official side of the house is an element of the offense.
well, it isn't that we've made a judgment, the local school board has made a judgment which has a lot of experience under both systems.
so you think there can always be two petitions, one  of sentences on review?
because sentences that are outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a sentence within the range. and that is why that if the court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what booker said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to iron out sentencing differences, there is more reason for the 
and i'm just  and the order was defective because it didn't make findings required by the rule. and i'm just wondering, supposing it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered. would the party then be entitled to rely on the date, february 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty to investigate and find out exactly when the judge signed the order?
well, i think you are, your honor, and if our brief came across that way, i  i think it overstates the line that we're asking this court to draw. the court has recognized, in talking about accommodations, that of course accommodations by their very nature benefit religion. that's part of an accommodation and could be said to have the effect. but the court has said then we must draw lines. that is, the court has recognized that you can't just say, oh, it's an accommodation which means that's fine, it's always going to be fine if it's an accommodation. in fact, justice o'connor said we need to draw lines because otherwise everything will just become, oh, that's an accommodation.
well, as we said in our brief, we think 9(b) applies here. obviously, this is a fraud case.
well, a, i think that's an inference that's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the motion, but b, in any event, there's been an independent reweighing of all of the evidence in the ohio intermediate appellate court and that court said that  very specifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the principal  or principal offender, the actual shooter  we do believe that. but even if we didn't, the death sentence here would be appropriate. and this court noted in clemons that an independent reweighing by an appellate court of the evidentiary record can be sufficient to secure  or to 
i  i guess i could agree with you if  if i believed that i had to look to the primary purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was transportation. but what  what do you do about gambling ships that, you know, they  they sail out beyond the 2-mile limit and then come right back to where they left? now, people get on board not to get transported. they get on board to gamble. and the purpose of the ship, the primary purpose of the ship, is gambling. you think that  that  the  the seamen who  who are on that ship, which regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you think that they're  that they're not covered by the jones act?
there's a distinction between violent assaults and 
i'm sorry. i'm not sure 
well, not too much.
justice scalia, with  with all due respect, i don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply 
general long, if you were designing a system to set standards to guide the federal judge in deciding how to treat these, what standards would you set?
i do have an answer, first, for justice ginsburg's question from ms. greensberger. the sanction has never been imposed under title ix of cutting off funds. and it 
 your hypothetical.
no, your honor, it doesn't.
yes, your honor and the trial court knew about it when it made its ruling.
that's right.
when i say yes, the  what would  what would be left is an entire hearing on the  on the strickland claims and the motion to vacate. that  that would be the remaining part of the case 
right.
we  we believe that's the case and they have not yet said that it would hinder the state secrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed quite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding back only a need-to-know basis. they have not asserted any state secret privilege with the remaining regulations. and we know, in fact, from the letter that is in the record from  between the cia and the justice department in which the  there was basically an understanding that there would be regulations like this in order to make sure that these pl-110 resettlees did not effectively become wards otherwise on  on the government and that the cia would continue some responsibility for them. the  we are not aware of any case in which this court has suggested that there is an obligation of the district court to look behind the use of doe and determine in a public manner the identity of the person. that  the government seems to assume that they have some entitlement to have a self-inflicted harm that they would demand that the identity of the does be disclosed publicly and that they're entitled to do that. we do not believe that that's a required part of the use of does. and in any event, we think it is somewhat similar to the criminal context where, if the government is going to insist on moving forward in some way that is an affirmative defense like that, they may well have a responsibility for not being able to defend their position if they, at the same time, say that the state secret privilege applies. but at this point, anyway, that has not been presented to the district court. we  we find it strange that the government so quickly now says, unlike what it argued in webster, that there is this type of contract which is not subject to the jurisdictional bar, and that is a contract with their own employees when they tell us that those same employees are going to know a much broader swath, as mr. clement said, of secrets. if their rationale made sense as something that was so compelling that the court should create a jurisdictional bar for what the courts would otherwise have the capacity and the competence to do, you would think it would apply in that situation as well. but the fact is they lost webster, and so they have to try to say that there is something still very broad about totten but explain away webster, and they simply cannot convincingly do that. webster was the same argument by them. reynolds was the same argument by them, and they lost.
yes, justice souter.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
right. exactly. if  in michigan they have a 
may i ask you this question?
so the answer is 
 they 
that's the major matter we're resolving today.
i guess you're telling me i'm  i'm the underdog in this case.
well, i  i must assume that if we  if the court says they are immune from the  from capital punishment that someone will come and say they also must be immune from, for example, life without parole.
mr. waxman, i thought the ninth circuit did decide that question in another case that was pending, santos.
and if you think, in order for there be to a  to be a valid suspension, congress has to do it consciously, then i think you could see why the arguments are mutually exclusive. my view would be that if congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the writ, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would still be constitutionally valid. so, i think that may be the disagreement.
but the term available  and i think this is critical. the term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and i don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.
yes.
it protects from liability, too.
if it's not  the record shows that there's no difference in the views expressed by the jurors, yes. in this case that 
no, i don't  i don't think that's true, justice stevens, that there will be times  i don't think this is one of those cases, but there will be 
yes, he did suggest that. and several courts have 
have you looked at 
now, do you  do you agree that all the papers showing the arrest and the investigation and so forth show that this was in fact a building 
that he had had  had access to nothing. in other words, he didn't say, "i didn't have access" 
no, it doesn't say it  it is deemed to continue to be pending. the issue is deemed to be reserved.
well, but 
thank you, mr. salmons. mr. frederick.
you  you concede, though, that if  if the challenge to the underlying contract implicates the arbitration clause as well, that that is for the court and not the arbitrator.
but if it's jurisdictional, we have to say, you know, too bad. yes, you were misled by the judge. in reliance on the district judge, you expended a lot of time and money, but there was no jurisdiction. and that's the end of the matter.
well 
and if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?
well, do you think it should be?
do you want to reserve any time?
that's correct.
but i'm saying 
yes.
yes, but i don't  i guess that's where we're parting company. i don't see that there is a state law claim as distinct from a state law procedure for trying that claim in a state court. as i  as i said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983. it doesn't create causes of action, but it provides a  a jurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got a cause of action. and in this case, it's a federal cause.
 theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the treaty.
but i would  i would respectfully disagree with your honor's premise that  that he  he's not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition. he did  he is seeking, as  as we see it, to 
 to go do something unlawful.
okay. then that is engaging in something more than construing the pleadings most favorably to the plaintiff.
well, but i thought we said, at the outset  and correct me if i'm wrong  if arizona imposes liability on private safety inspectors for injuries to third persons, then the united states would be liable here.
i'm not sure i quite understand.
this was an arbitration case, and the alabama supreme court had said that we're not going to enforce the federal arbitration act, and alabama is one of the three states that has  that has a state statute that bars it.
well, of course, i guess from the standpoint of the libertarian party, it's kind of a problem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under oklahoma law with their  their prior registration have to do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't know if the libertarian party will even qualify for having a primary. i mean, it just gives them a very impossibly short window. if the time were reasonable, that might be a different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?
well, my question to you is  i take it you're answering yes, that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, that's not good enough unless the petitioner proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the state to expose someone to the risk of what has  what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the petitioner himself doesn't come up with an alternative.
would you say it's 
it's strongly supported in the history. it may lose your client the money. i don't know.
okay.
you mean to say if there was  if there was perfect probable cause for the prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its tracks by  by an allegation of the first amendment violation?
now  now is that argument  i mean, i'm sorry that i 
your honor, that was a strategic choice, though. this is not a sixth amendment claim. we're looking at the eighth amendment now. and so what counsel chose to do is not the question. we're looking at what he did, and we've got this record to work with.
isn't there an axis, and the axis turns?
thank you, general. the case is submitted.
well, there is a 
yes. i think that there are circumstances, in terms of alleging particular injuries and interference with the making, enforcing, or performance of contract. i don't 
well, but 
are you suggesting that some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young child?
here  no. well  no. here's what i would appeal to. i  there are three relevant factors that this court has to look at. there's the determination of consensus. is there enough of a one or isn't there? there's the determination of proportionality, and then there's the issue identified in lockett and in atkins, which is how reliable is the individualized sentencing process. how reliably  when we're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst of the worst, how reliably can we do that? we think that with respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that the eighth amendment requires recognizing 18. but i will take as a posit your hypothetical question that i haven't convinced you on number one, number two, or perhaps individually on all three. this is truly a case, justice kennedy, in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. taken together, the fact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the crime of an adolescent was really the feature of an enduring character, since we know, as in atkins, that many of the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental retardation also affect the inability of adolescents to communicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that 2 years later when this person is on trial, physically, emotionally it's not the same person that the jury is looking at and being asked to evaluate 
he was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.
yes it is. because the whole  one of the reasons you have reasonably short time is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it. if you have to file within 15 days with the prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, "do you remember what happened?" "yes. this, this, and this." "who else was there?" "these people were there." you wait 3 months, the prisoner files a complaint, they ask the guard, "do you remember?" "not really. it was 3 months ago." "who else was there?" "i'm not sure." then he has  you know, the evidence against him is much weaker when he files his claim in federal court.
let me ask this one very brief question, mr. chief justice. in your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be satisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be omitted from the instruction 13?
or he could go public, i assume. he could say, "i got fired for saying this. and this was true." right? take it to the press. the press would love it.
thank you.
 heavy 
leegin. and mr. olson says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?
yes.
justice scalia, as i think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts. the government's submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle. a proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within 
 what's the question before 
nothing is left.
no, but before you direct me to cases 
these  these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason  what happens if you withdraw for any reason?
habeas is an equitable 
yes, your honor. what the court said in gibbons versus ogden was that health laws of every description were for the states to regulate. in glucksberg, this court 
it's not an if, but if that happens, then it shall be 
because whatever the resolution in the state court litigation, the resolution of that question will not impact the legal question before this court now, which is, on first federal habeas, a claim that was filed that did not rely on avena when it was filed, did not rely on the presidential determination  -
well, your honor, the  again, the intermediate appellate court independently reweighed this evidence and concluded that even if we conclude that mr. stumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our  our conclusion  it isn't, but even were we to conclude that, the death penalty would still be appropriate here. so there's been an independent reweighing of the evidence minus the mitigating evidence or minus the 
 but 
but, of course, if you take that view, why did they bother to put the words, anticipatory search warrant, on the document? that's what we're fighting about. if we decide it on your ground, we never should have taken cert.
 i think.
be- 
all right. well  well, then this  this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, i  i think we have to be more precise here. i think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. if he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the restatement at least  i don't know california law  says that you  would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel 
suppose  suppose a person has a piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no building  no building  which destroys the value of the property pretty much. now, should we just  i think those might be the cases where this language began to appear, something like that. should that be just a simple rational basis review too? because i'm trying to put the case where it might be  arguably you should have something stronger since the property value is  is seriously hurt and 
yes, your honor. if the university had such a policy, then the university would be able to enforce it. but i hasten to add 
but in an organizational context, that's the only way that directives like this can be given out and implemented. this wasn't a case of 
yes.
how does it compare to title ii of the civil rights act of 1964?
i don't think they have to invoke the contract, your honor, in the sense that 
we have  we have quite a history, as you just identified in your response to justice kennedy, of being concerned about particularly grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these tests of compactness for use in this very litigation. and the fact that the lawyers have come up with this approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some relevance to the whole problem we're trying to confront.
i'm sorry. i didn't follow that question, justice kennedy.
well, there's no major restructuring of the 
well, the  the racial motivation to create a district  to  to reach out as far as they did to capture 
well, your honor, the systems converge at the end point. and that is, under the federal system, going to that right end point would be unreasonable in every circumstance if there's no justification offered, other than he committed the offense. in california, because we have three discrete terms rather than a spectrum, you have the same effect when you get to the end point. it would be unjustified  it would be an unreasonable sentence if there's no justification offered. but the fact that california has three points rather than a range shouldn't be constitutionally determinative.
i understand 
well, i don't think that that could be the end of it. as justice ginsburg pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or white and even in the hypothetical that your honor poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses, the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee was acting within the scope or not. if i could use a simple example of assault. if the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her. even if that would be outside the scope of employment, the employee might say  the supervisor rather might say, i never raised my hand at all. i raised my voice official certainly but i never raised my hand. a third party witness may say well i saw the supervisor wag her finger at the employee but not in a threatening fashion. now 
well, if they said they were, then it seems to me  why don't you just hold them to it?
well, as it was just mentioned, "multifactor," in a footnote, it said it would be neutral. i think the big point in fogerty was that it was going to apply in both directions, be neutral as between plaintiff and defendant.
i don't 
your honor, presumption of correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error, deferential review. that's my point.
well, the alternative at a minimum has to be 
yes, they are.
because the  the facts in this case show that there was no other reason for him to approach that vehicle than to rob that individual. there was no premeditated intent.
but that's something that  but self-defense is something that's often a  a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime. the  the other guy had a gun, you know, that sort of thing. so if it's going to be presented  so it's something that's within the control of either side. duress is something that in this case the government would have no reason to suppose that it was even implicated until it's raised, and then they have no way of getting at what the particulars are because they're all within the control of the defendant.
i think if this court could determine that, as a matter of course, the  the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the court's fourth amendment analysis. that  i think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, justice souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the  under  when trying to decide how best to proceed. one of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. one of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. so, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away  you can remove the handcuffs? that may be, although i don't think there's much in the record here to  to reflect that. but what the police said here  and i think it's extraordinarily important. officer muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a  in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. and he said to himself and he said it quite rightly  and it's a rule this court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of  of law  is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate  and i mean, literally eliminate  the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.
do we know, in this case, what time lapse there was between the issue letter and the order?
other than the fact 
those were cases in which, typically, the sheriff was sued for trespassing.
 further discussion?
that's exactly right, justice breyer.
in determining whether the evidence before congress was sufficient, i think, you know, this court has said  i think the standard comes from city of boerne  it's the congruence and proportionality test, but it recognizes that congress has to have a great deal of leeway in determining where the line between enforcement and substantive change in the law lies. and, you know, here we have, whatever standard we use, the kind of record of constitutional violations that justifies prophylaxis. we have  we have constitutional rights that impose on states obligations of accommodation. so, the ada is, in no circumstance 
that's the premise of my question. but i mean it seems to me to be fairly easily administered.
may i ask a question on another subject, just talking for a minute about your in rem theory of the case? and i understand you would contend that assets have been subject to a fraudulent transfer or a preference should be deemed to be part of the estate. but is it not true that this case also involves a claim on the accounts receivable? and do you contend they also should be treated as part of the estate?
yes, your honor.
well, those cases, as we note, do present, often, special circumstances not present in this case, justice kennedy. but the answer to the question that's presented here is the same. you still would look to whether or not there is private  a private-person analog. and, if there is, then you would look to the liability of private persons in that circumstance.
no, no. i  you've missed my point and i'm sorry. i put you on the wrong track with my following up. i shouldn't have.
first, they have a chenery problem; and that is, this doesn't appear anywhere in the commission's ruling. what they said in the commission's ruling is that they could take a title i information service and regulate it as common carriage. this is an entirely different animal. this is 
if congress has the situation set up that florida does not engage in  in rulemaking. they don't go through an orderly administrative process, taking public input and having people come and participate in that. it's totally 
is there international authority required 
i mean, conceivably you could have read the rule that way at the time of johnson, but first we have this court's decision in johnson, which says the submission of a post-verdict rule 50(b) motion is an essential prerequisite even for the district court to act on the motion. and, therefore, if the motion is not renewed, the district court is entitled to treat it as abandoned. and, second, the rule, in its current form, limits the authority of the district court to enter a judgment as a matter of law post-verdict to the situation where the court is ruling on a renewed motion. the rule doesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not renewed and yet the district court purports to rule on the 50(a) motion that was left hanging by the submission of the case to the jury.
but they did not  significantly they did not ask for read back of the witnesses who testified similarly to, to ms. maples. the third party culpability case was basically not credited by the jury. they did not a read back of those witnesses.
well, you 
mr. stewart, should we repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?
i think we would be entitled to it under the  the terms of the plan.
what happens when it goes back?
that's right and they 
if his job 
so we still have to decide the fobian issue. and your failure to defend it here means that we're going to have to decide in on that inadequate record. if you have mentioned that in an opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted cert in the deroche case and had an argument about the rule that we have to decide.
violations. i apologize. the eeoc filed suit because of these violations of the act.
they concede  the only expectation of privacy you've got to have for fourth amendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a minimal one  they concede that the  that this individual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to raise a fourth amendment claim.
right.
you could. you could also require those things without resale price maintenance and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise the price to pay for that or to provide it so efficiently that he could in effect engage 
the "different way," of course, would be to get a warrant.
all right.
i mean, you  you could say the  you could say the same thing, counsel, about his right to self-representation, that he has the right to self-representation for his defense or for his 
i'm talking about district 25.
likewise in 1442(a), which was about the federal 
yes, they certainly could do that as a matter of fact. we don't believe that should alter the debt limitation congress enacted, and that's precisely why we believe that the guam supreme court opinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose of congress and gives a real debt limitation that exactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that congress intended. and that's why the assessed value can be so easily manipulated, and is not a reasonable interpretation. i also would like to address justice breyer's question about the 
i think in neder  neder is a different case and for a number of reasons. unlike neder, there has never been a claim that there's any incorrectness in either the verdict in the charge or in the jury instructions. in fact, mr. recuenco from the outset had no reason to suggest that there was anything wrong because the state was free to charge him with the lesser offense, and they did. there would be no motive on his part to say, excuse me, your honor, i think i'm really guilty of a greater offense. please ask the state to amend its information.
yes, i understand that. can you answer my question? you  you were saying that the  that the decision by the federal court on this issue is not final.
well, the convention 
 supreme court, and that was not done. was any other effort made that you can tell us about? maybe you should, off the record, but to try and get the guidance of the california supreme court on the  on the state-law problem here? has anybody suggested to the court they might adopt a rule or a different practice or anything like that?
you may do so. mr. lewis.
all right. let's say it's wrong about that.
no, i'm not talking about the  i'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier. and  and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner. it has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner. okay? that's  that's the hypothetical. do  do you think that that  that is governed by federal law?
no, your honor. going  going back to the beto case, the court said free exercise applies in prison, but in o'lone, the court said it applies in prison but the standard what we're going to use is one that's very similar to  to rational basis.
the engert case specifically held that the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" circumstance was only invalid as an eligibility determinant, because it failed to adequately narrow. so, it specifically 
yes, but of course, the aggravators  it would be permissible for a state to include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category in the definition of the crime itself.
it hasn't changed.
all right. but suppose the police are twisting his arm behind his back until he initiates a further discussion. you would say that's fine?
 in this case, in order to determine it was untimely, they would have presumably had to have gone into the factual analysis of whether the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a year after getting the materials, and all of that stuff. so, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits of it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it on the merits and not reach the "timely" question.
as we're still talking generically, i don't think it necessarily would be. because it could regulate the relationship between long distance providers official and their customers. i mean, that's the core of what 201 is about. it's about how much they can charge, what kind of practices they can have in relationship to their customers. but here we're not talking about a long distance provider that is a common carrier in relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates and practices.
let  let me ask you this. i  i don't yet have the  the record showing the full closing argument of  of both sides, but we do have the portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? can adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?
your test wouldn't cover the example i just gave.
yes.
okay.
you see, part of what's worrying me is that once you get into the fifth amendment, which is  prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless. because every time a person walks across the doorstep, every time a person wants to install a pipe in the basement, read the meter  i mean, i can see possibilities of actions of this kind arising, and particularly when the government wants to buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should be sold. is there a threat lurking in that conversation? you see what i'm worried about here, which wasn't present in the other case?
i'd to get your  i'd like to get your position. i  i think justice souter is correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not grounds for suppressing evidence. so we can have nighttime searches with no suppression remedy.
that was  in many of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the duties they were performing they were performing pro bono publico.
i think that there is a level of objective component that the statute at least has to be understood by a reasonable person at some level using standard statutory construction. but that isn't to suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a higher court or even a district court for counsel to get guidance. and of course, in this case, there was no guidance supporting respondents  excuse me  no guidance supporting petitioners', defendants', position. in fact, the only guidance supported our position, including guidance from the ftc.
well, certainly. let me give an example. one of the circumstances that i indicated that the police  a manner in which the police must behave when reasonably executing a warrant is not to look in places where the items sought cannot be found. if the police were searching a house for stolen computer monitors, a large object, and as they were searching for them, they opened the desk drawer where the monitor could not be and they shut it, and they found computer monitors in the home, the  this court has never addressed the question, that i'm aware of, but the law is uniform in the country that you would not suppress the computer monitors.
yes, the preliminary injunction. and the fact that the resolution is technically latent on the books, they are will repeal that, they repudiate that resolution. thank you.
 this question? part of your appeal of your case is, you talk about the corporate offender or tax dodger, something like that. it seems quite unreasonable, i agree with you. but what if you defined the class much more narrowly and limit it to people who have been convicted of violent crimes of a very serious nature and so forth, and said, as to those, they can have a totally suspicionless search? would that 
 to the hearsay rule. it's present sense impression.
well, your honor, respectfully, what we do have is undisputed fact here because if you see judge weis' conclusion, for example, judge weis is one of the people who has adopted one of the opinions opposing our view of  of this position.
the  the resulting impact  i would say no. the resulting impact has not been determined for jurisdiction.
constitutionally deficient and did not fulfill the requirements of the fifth amendment.
just let me ask this one question. supposing the label says, this product contains vitamin a. period. and it doesn't contain vitamin a, and they prove that in court. and you say you would have to change the label. i suggest you could change the product by putting vitamin a in it.
we hope all your answers will be principled. (laughter.)
that's right. this  my argument is that the plain language makes clear that congress did enact a substantive change. and, indeed, to interpret the law as petitioner suggests, would render the words about "physical violence or threats of violence" as mere surplusage. and so, for example, some of the illustrations that were mentioned earlier, one was about the possibility of a planned pride and attempt. but, in a model penal code, section 5.01, it's clear that any substantial step is sufficient for an attempt that 
well, on other findings, is there a different standard of review of what the district court found as opposed to what congress found?
but you say that's what they should have had, given  given the voting in the state.
your response is i was resettled because i was a spy.
well, i think that paragraph 7 of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the other, but their case, justice stevens, depends upon the following. because if i 
the purchase  the idea that bagels are being purchased only for evangelicals and not for jewish breakfasts?
yes.
we could call it what we will. i think  i think that it still would be within the narrow proposition that we're advocating that a  that a description of the crime to a known 
justice scalia, imagine, if i may take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the government said in the statute that the union must obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use agency fee funds to support democratic candidates, but not if it's going to support republican candidates. obviously it couldn't do that.
no, your honor. if  there  there are two processes that go on. the tax court judge, quite appropriately, we  we assume and have  have no reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the special trial judge. if  if in the course of that discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion that something is wrong in the original report and if the special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting a corrected report, and having the presumption of correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected report. if  if 
right.
well, but, justice kennedy, i think we have our answer to that, which is the best reading of the statute requires the intent at the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody  in the 99 percent of the cases that dr. crainer sets out to performs a d&e and succeeds, there's no issue in the world because everybody would look at that and say that's a d&e. in the one case 
likewise, a business that does not locate in ohio is not subject to the  to the higher ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.
but what good is that as  as an answer to our question? sure, no harm, no foul. but that can't be the  that can't be the criterion for a court and that can't be our criterion in deciding whether he really has a right to his first choice or not.
no  i 
we also actually entered a mandate, too. [laughter.]
well, the courts  the courts usually do that, don't they?
i agree with you, justice stevens.
well, hopefully we'll win on preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the new jersey ii suit, but also the new jersey i suit, which we say the district  or the delaware judgment precludes.
 that fuel is not going to be used on 
yes, your honor. we believe expenditure limits can be upheld without overruling buckley v. valeo, and that's for several reasons. first, buckley created a rule of exacting scrutiny that applies to expenditure limits. that is not a rule of automatic invalidation. and very importantly, when buckley declared that the interest in deterring corruption and its appearance was not adequate to support the expenditure limits, that was on a record in which neither spending nor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits prior to the time of feca and the amendments that the court was considering. there simply was no record to show the court of how contribution limits alone would really work to address the problem of corruption and the appearance of  of corruption and encouraging public confidence in government. now 
that  that is correct. had the 
well, in miccosukee, the court actually go into that and set forth  in fact, remanded the case to decide whether the aquifer was one water body or two. if you look at that remand, it's absolutely clear that this water body, under any standard discussed in that opinion, would be a single water body. and the united states agrees with us on that. the united states agrees we're talking about a single water body here.
may i ask you this question, mr. mitchell? supposing the  there are alternative lesser-included offenses that might be urged by the defendant as to  to get an instruction on, and he asks for the wrong one. in other words, the question  there is a question here about exactly what is the lesser-included offense. it seems to me that if he tried to kill  if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well have been some kind of crime. but maybe you ask for a lesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the facts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit manslaughter or something else. would your request for  for a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction be sufficient if you should really have asked for a different lesser-included offense instruction?
well, i think that's the second step of the analysis. the first step of the analysis, which is what this case is  before the court is, on initiation. now, voluntariness 
well, i think the issue was resolved by the state court's factual determination that landrigan was not credible even in making that assertion that i would have allowed presentation of genetic predisposition of violence.
they had a generic claim about secondary copyright liability. we made the motion  or, actually, streamcast made a motion that said, "let's carve this piece out and talk just about whether the set of current activities supports secondary liability." the other side eventually agreed that that was distinct and severable from their claim of secondary liability as to past acts and as to past versions of the software, which has  which has changed.
even with reference to commercial  proposed commercial transactions?
so, we have to give some instructions as to how the  as to whether or not the ninth circuit is right about that.
here is how i get out of it, justice scalia. if you think, as i do not, that the revenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the united states in a criminal prosecution, there is a background principle that says when there is an established rule of the common law, congress legislates against that background, and unless it makes its intent clear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of the common law, then the statute will not be interpreted to be in derogation of it. it was that principle that formed the basis for the government's view that canada cannot come in under the rico statute 
well, does  does consumer  if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?
so you're saying  saying then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar, and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government.
under this statute, justice kennedy, that's not the issue. i think the timeline here is critical. this was not a company that was routinely exercising a document-destruction policy, or document-retention policy, to maintain only that which was necessary for its ongoing business.
mr. chemerinsky, the district  i mean, the trial court made certain findings and i'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. the first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing cochran to pay tory amounts of money which tory was not entitled. that's one finding. and then finding 24, despite repeated requests, tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money  a monetary settlement by cochran. and then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. and those sound like findings. it's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the  that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.
because the hammer is thrown through the window, is that  i just want to be sure i understand your view of the importance of the hammer.
 and all.
what  what is the obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this case to give a coherent explanation of why there  the juror was excused? that step has proceeded. we're at that step in batson where an explanation has to be given. what  what have we said about how coherent and complete that explanation has to be?
yes. yes.
well, this is how it's applied under california law. to give another example 
yes.
than it was further 
no, no. the conclusion is that she was striking jurors on the basis of the race, that she is using 
we disagree with that entire position. the text 
so programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
it leaves it up to case-by-case. it leaves it up to the administrative agency, all in areas where i frankly don't know one lunch from another.
the jury does not. you have the option of presenting it to the jury but you do not have to present it to the jury. you can present it first to the trial judge and you can also present it at the appellate level.
is that 
is it true that none of them give unfettered access? they're all qualified in some fashion. do you agree with that?
i'm asking 
i think that's one interpretation of the rule, your honor. we read that  the rule a little bit stricter than that, and we limit that extension in our reading to the 7-day period after the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the denial. but i think that that is a  that is a reading 
so those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those things, in a sentencing phase with capital  with  you know, capital sentencing?
i think it 
well, to take the two that were at issue in this opinion. the court of appeals said the ceo, yeah, there's enough there to get over that threshold. the other guy, no, there wasn't. so it's not that she's saying what you find for one, you find for all. she is going at it defendant by defendant.
but if this court opens that door, don't you think we might see a different problem?
justice scalia, in the context of all of this other evidence, which is the context in which you need to weigh it and determine whether we have satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies, i respectfully submit that if you go through the  the voir dire questioning of mr. fields and mr. warren and mr. rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it, even leaving aside all of the other evidence, contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the jury selection in this case, i think you will have to come to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these cases. in mr. fields  we've  we've mentioned him in our  we've described him at length in our brief. this is a man whom  i mean, forget the  the state on its questionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint lodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death penalty. mr. rand, who we've compared and  and your concurring opinion, justice scalia, the last time it was here said, well, yes, rand and mazza are very close, but it's a high burden you have to  you have to overcome here. it's a burden we can overcome here not only because of all of this other evidence, but because of what the state wrote on the questionnaire when mr. rand was being examined, page 30 of the joint lodging. this is the state's notes, quote: "could be enforced depending on the circumstances  murder/robbery, type of offense  think proper for death penalty  yes, i can serve." this is a  this is a venireman who said that if he were governor, he would set the minimum punishment for murder at 99 years. mr. fields was 
 absolutely right.
so  so we might still keep a  a stronger test where a zoning ordinance affects the number of people that could live in a house or 
correct, your honor.
the affidavit itself says there is now concealed a certain person or property. he checked the wrong the box 
your honor, we certainly raised the severance issue in the district court.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
well, if you took a settlement  his theory, i take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a capital asset. is that right?
yes. the location number one is his mother's house, 2646 cimmaron, and that's  and officer muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. they had information that  the reason they did that is that they had information that  that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his  his mother from time to time.
would it be a 
the  there was testimony in the record that those who have a primary might actually get a bump over others who are not challenged. but as the district court pointed out, in vermont what makes vermont different is that our primary is late. it's the second tuesday in september, and so it's less than 8 weeks from the general election. it's not like having a primary in the spring. and as the legislature during those 65 hearings considered the campaigning, they considered all kinds of campaigns, including contested primaries and not, and again, average spending in these campaigns was, with minor exception of the single-member senate districts, of which there are three  that average spending was below these expenditure limits. so in the average campaign, you could actually spend more than  than on average is being spent. and the issue, when you've got competing constitutional interests, is whether we address our problems of corruption, appearance of corruption. we try to free up candidates' and public officials' time from fund raising. we try to create competitive elections and bring more citizens into the process voting, grassroots campaigning, and standing for election. we want more people to run.
i'm asking 
thank you, mr. clement. mr. goldberger, we'll hear from you.
what is reasonable is  is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. it seems to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of the reasons that are given. and in the chief justice's view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for two different sentences. does the, does the appellate court in his example say, well, i think reasonable people could go either way on that, so however it comes out it's fine on appellate review? isn't that what the court would have to do in order to affirm both sentences, other things being equal?
well, i'm  my memory, at least, of the court of appeals opinion, is that it was saying that the wait before the donning was not compensable, because it was a preliminary activity. but i  if you've read it differently, then that may be 
you're  you're saying it might not make sense as a systemic policy 
i'm sorry, your honor.
an example  the only example that i can think  the only practical example that i can think of, however, where a trial court is likely not to draw a strong negative inference from the prosecutor's failure to answer is in the situation suggested where it reviews it  reviewed it on appeal and the prosecutor died. under those circumstances, the  maybe there  there may be notes in the file, but if there aren't notes in the file, the prosecutor's failure to answer is beyond his control.
it 
 that was 
but once there's a broad waiver 
all right. so if i reread the blue brief, what i'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence. and what you want this court to say is, you're right about that, we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence. end of case.
 about the right to argue? is that what it is?
and my formulation, which is simply the donning and doffing process, would, in fact, leave the  to the lower courts the question of precisely when donning begins and doffing ends. that's a fair point.
did the sixth circuit have the current michigan policy before them when they made their decision?
can 
and if you do have all three, is that enough to prove a violation?
why not?
well, justice o'connor, no more so than under the free  the free exercise clause itself. i mean  and as this case, of course, comes to this court, the substantiality of the religious beliefs and that they are actually held by these individuals has been stipulated to.
do we have that anyplace at  in the papers before us, the first  the first dismissal in the florida  in the florida trial court?
that's correct. however, in this case there is a peculiar meaning to the word "attempt" that when congress used the word "attempt" they meant to bring with that word its requirements under the common law.
why is it retroactive validation? i would have thought segura and those cases are silverthorne cases.
it is. thank you, mr. cole.
i'm not talking about what the federal courts have said. i'm talking about what  what michigan has said and  and what the court of  has the court of appeals spoken on that subject?
but what  the specificity you need for the narrowing factor does not exist with respect to mitigating factors. we've said anything can be a mitigating factor. i find it impossible to believe that the california supreme court said not only is the phrase "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" too  you know, too vague for the narrowing factor, but, when you get to the weighing phase, the fact that the murderer sliced up his victim with a thousand cuts of the knife cannot be taken into account by the jury. that's unbelievable.
justice ginsburg, that's an argument that appears in the solicitor general's brief as well, and i believe that the solicitor general's focus on a difference in state interests is misplaced when one is dealing with federal jurisdictional principles. instead, i think the focus should be on the expression of the federal interest, and the best expression of the federal interest at stake is congressional intent when one is dealing with acts of congress, federal statutory law.
right. i mean, i think  the way i would style it is to develop a substantive standard that's very forgiving of brand-new technologies and allows people to point to, in those situations, capabilities for future uses. i do think that 
no. the statutory claim wouldn't be before the district court. again, if  if the 
i mean, isn't the answer that the  that this is up to the voters. the voters can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if they choose.
well, it's not entirely clear, your honor. i think that it's sometimes difficult to distinguish, certainly between motivation and suggestion. one way in which it is used for example, is if there were some indication in the prior art that doing something a certain way might save money and then there would be a motivation to save money, which might supply the requisite motivation for combining the two prior art references.
if an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason i would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a  a right this court rejected in martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in michigan an indigent is allowed to  would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so. the problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a 
what are the first few words of the sentence there that you quoted?
two points on that, your honor. first of all, the problem of holding candidates accountable in that manner is greatly exacerbated when you have a system of unlimited spending in which all of the candidates involved feel compelled to go out and raise as much as they can in order to forestall the possibility of being outspent. then when a voter says, well, why are you doing this, the candidate has a ready-made answer. if i don't do this  you know, maybe i'd rather not, but if i don't, i'm going to be bested in the fund-raising arms race. and voters reluctantly have come to 
oh, in other words what he implies, if i ready the whole page i'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, i'm not telling you if you get the money or not?
 the 
well, and that's  that 
so, you 
it seems to me that ought to be the really  the people who are the objects of this experiment. do they think it's doing 
well, the agency is allowed to change its position and we realize 
you're talking here about a question of united states law, what is the meaning of this treaty that the united states has entered into? do you know another case where we have  we have been bound by a judgement of a foreign court or an international court concerning the meaning of united states law?
well, it has  if it  oh, your honor, the  calling your  or you've called my attention to the instruction that said that the set  in the prior set of  or in the general set of instructions, that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative. now, that instruction had a cloud of confusion surrounding it, because the way it was phrased was, the court said, "the mitigating factors that i have expressed to you are illustrative." there was no list of mitigating factors. there was only a single list, unitary list, of factors that could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending on a jury's decision. the instruction that you're referring to, your honor, was a  was the result of the trial court denying some, and granting some, parts of the special instructions requested by the defense. and so, when the trial court said to the jury, "the list of mitigating factors is illustrative only," i  we, who know the background of this, understand what  the point he was trying to make, but the jury, hearing it, they would think, very reasonably, "there's no list of mitigating factors."
he filed before the act. the district court dismissed and said, believing erroneously 
mr. waxman  mr. waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the fcc, the one having to do with emissions. now, if you sought review from the local decision to the fcc, you petition for fcc relief, would the fcc have authority to give you attorney's fees?
i don't think it's close at all. i think they're obviously covered by the jones act.
if you're 
and if there are several allegations and  and each of them is somewhat doubtful but, on balance, he says, i give the benefit of the  of the doubt to the  to the district attorney, it's his indication that, as a matter of fact, he finds that the reason wasn't race.
thank you, mr. stewart. mr. schroeder.
isn't that  but isn't that what happened here?
why isn't it a reliable determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified accused in  in any event, and there have been specific aggravators proved? that has been determined. it's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that the mitigating circumstances outweigh this. the  and you have the bonus that the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not outweighed the aggravators.
i mean, it seems very odd that they  they say, "we were," and you say, "oh, no, you weren't." [laughter.]
it's not the whole question because if the statement  the question has nothing to do with and the answer had nothing to do with the emergency. it does not come in under the rule we're talking about.
let's say he's being 
does  does that up the ante and the defendant now is in the position to terminate the lawyer, or will the judge say it's  it's too late, i'm not going to grant that motion?
your honor, i believe that's correct. that's in  in subdivision (b).
what's wrong with that logic?
 the more legitimate it is. that's 
i thought  where  where were the drugs found?
it is  yes, it is a practice. i wouldn't characterize it a policy. it's a practice.
your honor, that's actually not correct either. schlup specifically says that the function of the district judge in a schlup hearing is not to make an independent judgment on the evidence in front of him, but to make a probabilistic determination of the effect of the evidence on a reasonable juror.
i'm asking about the application of u.s. law.
i take it you would be satisfied  not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct. because that would mean in the next case, you would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's negligence.
if it's a matter of federal law, it can't.
well, those are not the facts before the court, mr. chief justice. the facts are that he was driving fast but he was under control. he only crossed the center line to pass and when he passed, he used his turn signal when he passed.
no, the purpose of edwards was to prevent police badgering. to prevent police conduct that, conveys, directly or indirectly, that the police are going to continue questioning until they get a statement, despite the invocation of the right to counsel.
well, mr. chief justice, i would agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for  as a substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), "in connection with," such as in sec versus zandford, how far the outer reaches of the "in connection with" language go may well be susceptible of differences of opinion. there is no difference of opinion to which there can be any disagreement, in this case, about the plain language of the preemption, because the conduct  no matter what the conduct is that is involved "in connection with the purchase or sale of securities," one thing that is totally crystal clear, based on this court's cases and congressional purpose, is that the "in connection with the purchase or sale" language, as used here, does not restrict its application to the purchase or sale by the plaintiff such that 
right.
that's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?
mr. mccartan, what was the 1887 case or 1880 
of course, if it were a matter of florida law, the florida legislature could change it.
but that's  but suppose 
that's uniform in both alaska and new york, they are subject to the  to the blue cross waiver of attorney's fees or not. they're being treated uniformly. i don't see that that's disuniform. what is disuniform, it seems to me, is that you have an employee who wins a judgment in alaska and he gets to keep all his money because alaska law says the reimbursement provision is  is invalid, and then you have a federal employee in texas who  who gets a  wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over to blue cross all the  the portion of his recovery that would cover the outlay that blue cross has made. that's disuniformity.
no, your honor. i do not see this as a suspension of the statute of limitations. mr. rhines met the aedpa statute of limitations. he filed when only, by the state's own admission, 8 to 14 days had run on his 1-year aedpa statute of limitations.
i want to be clear. we think the same principles apply across the board to defining gross income. in applying that in a number of class action contexts, the proper answer may be that it's not included in gross income because there wasn't sufficient control and because it wasn't paid in  in lieu of a debt owed by the taxpayer. but here 
thank you, mr. wolfman. ms. blatt.
 the moral answer is also, "he stands before us with the scales already tipped. he stands before us having been shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed aggravated murder. he has the obligation to show us why he should be excused from that penalty. he has not done so. we can take anything that he came  brought to our attention, and we can say that this outweighs." it does not.
well, i would disagree, again with the characterization that it's just a failure to speak. the act requires a careful weighing of the public's interest, the ends of justice, the defendant's interest. so it's not just a matter of speaking. this is 
what is the sanction against  i mean, you just go in. you withdraw the money for  for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. what  what is the sanction?
 that that's one of the 
 effect 
and did you win or lose on that?
there  they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the  (laughter.)
because  because that claim was not ripe at that time, because we didn't know what would be utilized whenever it came to mr. hill being executed. our knowledge as to how florida department of corrections utilizes that discretion has been that they actually used that discretion in the past. we have not been able to get any records post-sims regarding their procedures, regarding the protocol 
your honor, the  the holding of munsingwear is that johnson v. wharton is good law, and a court need not give  may give preclusive effect to a case without an appeal.
well, it's certainly not this case, but 
but you're  you're saying he wants the 
in that 
well, it's not a sham transaction. you just happen to be related.
no.
it's 
okay. it is an argument.
did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court?
only to the extent that it is represented by the terms of the stipulation entered before the district court, your honor.
and aren't you arguing that in the prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise line, you are into establishment?
 the question.
yeah, but instead of saying they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally blocked out. because you analysis, i thought was, in response to my earlier objection, that the procedural right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the vindication of the substantive right. and because the substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their procedural rights, and we know that that can't be correct.
 one's  forget it.
but i thought that the reason that the police went after your client after he left the vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that point suspected that he might be impersonating a police officer. that's what the people in the  the disabled vehicle told the officer. they said he had flashing headlights. we thought he was a police officer. and  and wasn't the original following of your client triggered by the suspicion that he might be impersonating a police officer?
 requires a  a full  full assignment of any expenses the state  or full recovery of any expenses the state has incurred. it's not  it's a debate whether medicaid law requires that. and what you're saying is if we think the medicaid law does not require it, you would lose without regard to any consideration of the anti-lien provision?
 if they want to make their cases.
well, but i'm interested in justice o'connor's point. suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. with reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? in other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase  not the mark, but used the phrase  deliberately in order to cause confusion. would that 
no.
yes. the next report is issued september 11th of 2000. in that report 
justice o'connor, our research does not reveal that the question has arisen in the eu. i can, however, provide you some information, and that is that  two points i think. the first is they subscribe  the members of the eu subscribe to the same conventions and to unclos just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary authority within its ports and internal waters. and i have a couple of case citations for you on this issue. in the ecj, the diva navigation case, 1992, ecr i-6019, and the mateo peralta case, 1994, ecr i-3453. it has not arisen in the eu, but it has arisen in australia. australia has a disability law. it applies that law to cruise ships, and the rule in australia is that the port state law applies rather than the flag state law. and the citation for that is the union shipping case, 2002, nswca 124 ca 40379/01. i don't know what those numbers mean.
if  i'm not sure i understood the predicate of the question, justice stevens. which question are you asking?
for purposes of argument.
we believe that the process test that we're articulating here is unique to domestic violence mandatory arrest statutes across the country. the reason being is that these statutes were enacted precisely because of this problem, the problem of 
i don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. we said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a congress that  that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or  or not. and  and that's what you're asking us to do here.
 we don't have any empirical evidence, one way or the other, apart from the fact that california stands out in its system. is that correct?
but in, in brewer's case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic major depression. so it was certainly opened for a jury to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in assessing the likelihood that there was going to be further violent behavior.
and not being a common law court, it's not bound by its own prior decisions, is it?
i  i don't think you owe deference to the test. under strict scrutiny, you owe the fidelity of the constitution, and the constitution concludes the right to petition. so it is a difficult question. it's fact-intensive, as all as-applied questions are.
well, you just told me you agree that the burden was on the 
if the statute's clear. and of course, miss mahoney said the district judge thought it was clear, but the other way.
general clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 that's the 
where is the provision that generally disallows attorneys' fees?
well, it's not just disqualify. suppose he denies a motion for continuance. the counsel is in another trial and he said, i can't be here for another 10 days. and the court says, i  i deny that. i  i assume if it's an abuse of discretion, the result would be the same under your view.
so, then it is enforceable.
well, doesn't it seem odd  and this is sort of the logic of  in fausto and some of the other cases  that when you have a major action, you have to exhaust before you can go into court, but if you have something that doesn't qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to court right away?
an allegation by the plaintiff as elaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary, because where congress has waived the well-pleaded complaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the four corners of the complaint to include affidavits and other materials provided by the defendant. that has always been held the case in  in the rare instances where congress has made a federal defense removable. the court said that in the franchise tax board case, for example, and it's well supported by history from the 1870's 
well, did it rest upon the cession in wisconsin?
it's a hypothetical. we're not trying to do an individual case. i don't have a strong position on it. there is a case called roth berg in the eastern district of new york  the eastern district of pennsylvania, a district court case, that recognized an antitrust violation in a single stock manipulation. there are other cases called shumway and  and i forget the other case  that said, no, you can't have it. they've gone both ways. it wouldn't matter to our case at all. we're trying to get at  the securities laws are transactional. they can't get at a big wrong like this. they only get their own part of the elephant. the antitrust laws, this is business as usual, step into my office. as general clement says, the antitrust laws come if we prove that there was a horizontal agreement. then all of these individual efforts 
well, the, perhaps, perhaps that's so. certainly carnegie-mellon 
 court recognized 
i believe it replaces the word "pending" with some replacement. and so, it essentially changes the tolling provision to account for this problem. but that hasn't happened yet. right now, we have a congressional statute that, on its face, does not require the federal courts 
yes.
no.
i am talking about the ball letter.
i think, your honor, that brown is very much distinguishable. in brown, the topeka board maintained two systems of schools. and admission to those schools, admission, not assignment, was based solely on race. that stigmatized the black children. it sent the message that the white race was dominant and superior and that the black race was inferior. that caused great harm to those black students and this court properly remediated it.
i'm not sure that i would agree with that, justice souter, only because as i think justice o'connor explained in her dissent, there are two ways to read apprendi, and one of those ways would result in upholding guideline systems which are now invalid because of blakely and booker, but really quite different from apprendi because those systems involve what you would call guided discretion. that is, in apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the official judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was enhanced.
well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. one is the fact  the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. as for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. they say a hundred-thousand. they get their figures from the national organization from reform of marijuana laws. our figures in our brief come from the government. the figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. and their argument is basically  and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on  the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. you have to  what we're take  we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction  and justice kennedy's suggestion  would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're  it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.
i would not  it was not particularly relevant. it was probably an inartful attempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a difficult decision that they had ahead of them, one that they might 
well, that's one of the ways in which a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's not time-barred if the court rules it was erroneously. and that's the concern that i think my client has here.
what  what were the exceptional circumstances?
too hard for you? (laughter.)
that's true, your honor. but i think for purposes of trying to discern the intent of the 1966 congress one has to look at the state of the law in 1966. and there was no reason to believe and certainly no authoritative pronouncement at the time that 1346 covered this type of action, and i don't think 
was that  was that an ira that she had? it was an ira?
 a requirement for 
well, just before we leave 15(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in this case and there's potential for a gaping hole in aedpa. does the state have some ability to protect itself by filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the amendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the court to file a response?
but that doesn't include failure to exhaust.
i don't understand how that comes. how does that come about?
well, to the  to the extent  the jurors would have likely understood that, it  that instruction in belmontes and in payton, to extenuate the gravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing determination 
i thought step one was evidence from which it could be found more likely than not.
well, that, mr.  could your client's attorney have argued in the virginia habeas proceeding that his procedural default should have been excused because of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the time of the default?
no, justice o'connor, it was not. mr. corin, after speaking to his client on three occasions about this trial strategy, sought to concede the underlying  the underlying crimes but to argue what was the most essential part of this case, and that was whether or not death should be the outcome of the jury.
well, i think that the answer is yes if the court feels it needs to address that question. and to be sure, the strong inference standard that congress adopted was framed only in terms of the pleading stage. and our view 
i  i thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either state.
but those were the words and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could look at these words and say it's just nonsense. or one could say it's like mares-eat-oats. it isn't clear that this is "smoke pot."
nobody asked them to do anything other than that.
but that 
well, first of all, your honor 
 with a prosecutor who has absolute immunity.
well, you're still asking for cert.
 of that amount.
and i thought that some of the public opinion polls in  in a number of the countries support the death penalty.
but this is not an antidiscrimination provision. it doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters. it requires an adverse action. it requires an increase in the charge.
and it didn't do that.
 based upon the violation 
joint appendix a. and then there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to failing to investigate these alternative sources, we also want to say that counsel failed to explore additional grounds, and that was the sister. and the sister was going to testify that the mother  the foster mother, mrs. landrigan, abused alcohol, and she has a whole list of things in her affidavit. so is that still before us? i mean, isn't that something you want to argue?
well 
the 
your honor, i would cite you to the amicus brief of the state of arizona et al., which cites several cases, albeit not in this court, that stand for that principle. your honor, if i may turn to the merits quickly, section 202(a)(1) provides epa jurisdiction over any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit. it's not restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to air pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm. and not only does the act define air pollutant with comprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances are air pollutants from other evidence. for example, congress itself expressly referred to carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in section 103(g). and since by definition all air pollutants are air pollution agents, we know that congress understood carbon dioxide to be an agent of air pollution. and if air pollution 
well, two responses to that, justice ginsburg. first, there were other references where the opinion said "the town's facility." indeed, the flow control witness himself referred to it as the town's facility. and the other response is, to call someone a proprietor doesn't mean that they're private. in this case, they're charging $81  or $86 a ton. every ton that comes in, they make more money.
there is, of course, a remedy. since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this court has said in gertz v. welch is available to a public figure. there is a damage judgment that's available. certainly, your honor, there can't be a different rule 
 because we normally deal with that as specific performance of the contract, and what  you know it's in rem, in the sense that we're talking about an object, but that's not what we mean, traditionally, by "in rem jurisdiction," is it?
well, you say you don't object to the  the gregory standard, and the gregory standard is the one justice souter just quoted, raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence. now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on the other side? if the evidence on the other side is  i understand you dispute it in this case, but let's say unobjectionable dna evidence that your client was the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is it wasn't me. how can you tell whether that creates a reasonable inference or not without looking at what's on the other side?
or 1991. either one.
yes, sir.
justice souter.
yes 
and getting back to the first question that justice breyer asked  and then we got off on what the treaty really means  but assuming that the treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance  assuming that  is there any evidence that the district court thought that this was a compelling interest?
no.
the government's position is that on self-defense, the burden of proof is on the defendant, but it recognizes that there are important distinctions between self-defense and duress that could allow the court to reach different conclusions about the two defenses. in addition to the point that's already been made about the degree of factual overlap between self-defense on the one hand and duress on the other on the basic crime, there are three additional considerations. one is that the  the circuits and the states are virtually uniform on self-defense, whereas there is a significant division of authority on the question of duress. second, self-defense has always been a more favored defense because when the defendant acts legitimately in self-defense, he's not harming an innocent person. but when a defendant is actually under  acting under duress, that defendant is still endangering or harming innocent third parties. and the third reason is that there's always been a significant degree of judicial skepticism about claims of duress, but there's never been that same kind of judicial skepticism about self-defense. so while we do take the position that the burden of proof is still on the defendant, the court could take a different view on that issue and agree with us on duress.
that's right.
 think that 
and  and that 
well 
well, i thought that's 
and none other occurs to you?
the key point is that he is endangering the lives and safety of others. anyone who has watched that tape has got to come to that conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite direction. this was a situation fraught with danger.
why isn't that an answer to the misbranding? you change the product not necessarily the label.
that's correct.
as to just whether an unassessed tax claim 
well, he got  in this case, he got  and this is 
i think maybe you exaggerate the  the extent of equitable discretion. i mean, it wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems like a good idea or not a good idea. there are a lot of rules for when  when you would give injunctive relief and not. and  and i  you know, i'm not sure you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging allowance that  that you seem to be arguing for.
now, already you say that, but i would think the basic information includes some idea of what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the class 2 violations that i was convicted of were. and now, i've heard you both say that he does get it and that he doesn't get it. i'm sure that's my fault, but i want to know, does he get this information before the hearing, or does he not?
no, your honor. i believe that as was conceded in petitioner's reply brief, they're really under our governmental immunity laws. they're probably the strictest in the country. there really is no viable tort 
but at least  at least any fcc regulations relating to charges, practices  and you want to interpret practices very broadly  classifications, and regulations for and in connection with communication service, all of those regulations can be sued upon in federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as official the fcc says that the failure to obey this regulation is, in our view, unjust.
do you see what i'm 
but a very plain error 
and it would not be enough to show that the prosecution would have gone forward anyway.
i apologize for taking your time with a question, but i'm afraid your time is up.
the latter, justice alito. (laughter.)
i see.
 is tainted.
but the difficulty, i think, in the case is, it's artificial. i think it is. we're in an artificial situation, and we're imagining those 12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between mitigating and aggravating. we don't know. they  even. all right. now, you could look at this as saying, "you have to have a reason for thinking these people are  this person is morally worse than the average." and then we imagine some fungible commodity, like moral badness units. and for every one we go up on the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating side, so we're back to zero. and then, some people, like you, are looking at this and saying, "see, you're at zero. you went up, you went down, so they're no worse than the average." but other people can look at it and say, "we'll tell you about  one thing about this individual. this is an individual who did do the aggravating things, and he has counterbalancing mitigating things, and that's good enough to separate him out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't. now, my problem is, you either look at it the one way or you look at the other way, and you  and i'm trying to find a reasoned  if you  can  do you want to add anything?
well, the speech is on their side. the government just says, "let our recruiters in." so, why isn't it sort of like, "pay the property tax"? "i don't want to. i hate the government."
what about the practical problem that was raised that, in the automobile accident, there's witnesses, there's a police report, usually; but a slip-and-fall over mail, nobody's around, these are easily made up, and the post office has no opportunity to check?
thank you, mr. cotter. ms. maynard, you have five minutes left.
no, no. that's just an argument.
i would understand that if the government had acted uniformly. but we do have two situations that seem to be like  the peyote and this case. and if the government must accommodate to one, why not to the other?
your honor 
yes. would you still say it was not final, even though it was sufficiently final for appellate purposes?
 to that liability.
not for this court.
does the other side agree with that? i  i'd be surprised if that were the law in the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just blind themselves to the  to the prosecution's case when they make these calls.
well, we think the prophylactic measures are justified by the nationwide record, just as in this court's case 
you're begging the question by calling it a plan. i mean, that  that's  that's one of the issues here. why don't you tell us what workmen compensation laws require?
 would still be true.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
and why did 
and do they ever refer to foreign courts? that's the question.
there are cases in the lower courts, your honor, in the complete preemption area that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of complete preemption was not sustainable because the case was not completely preempted, but holding that preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied by the state courts on remand. and it's important to note here that there 
was there a private bill?
that's correct.
that's conceivable, your honor. we understand that the  we understood the sixth circuit opinion to be directed toward his conviction. so the 
is that true, is that conceded?
no, i mean about. just give me the rough ballpark.
that's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?
 but they didn't.
thank you, counsel.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
there is not language in 2254(d)(1). the language  the reason that we know that congress was cognizant of teague is that there is language throughout aedpa, particularly in the sections that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from teague.
well, do we just look at the averted harms, or  or do we, or congress, also look at the incidence of the averted harms? is it a theoretical  is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to some extent a quantified inquiry?
well, you were suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to comply and go through the state grievance procedure. and it seems to me that the reason you have the short procedures are to maintain a fresh record that more accurately reflects the truth, and, since congress was acting against the backdrop in which they thought there were too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be one way to limit those.
 suppose they're right about their interpretation.
why wouldn't you say that justice ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the meritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't  couldn't really do the job with this  with this new time assignment? why wouldn't it qualify as being sufficiently severe or persuasive 
may i ask you this hypothetical? supposing people like to work the forklift, but nobody had a  a right to do it, but they traded every day or something like that, and the company put out a notice that said anybody who  who files a claim will not be eligible to ride on the forklift ever again.
wait.
can you explain what the disincentive or other reasons for there being just 200 lawsuits out of the 13,000?
absolutely, your honor, yes. using peremptory challenges to select a fair and unbiased jury is very important to the state. having confidence that the juries are fair and unbiased is important because it allows parties to accept the results of verdicts as being a product of a fair and just system.
in the common law history, justice alito, we cited two cases from new york, the whaley case in 1827 and willett in 1915. and it was that body of new york law from which the hobbs act largely drew. those were cases in which the courts said that the fact that the government agent is extorting property for his own employer the government doesn't make any difference; it is still extortion.
 by it, are they?
and it wasn't a holding about what 
thank you, mr. niver. mr. marcus.
 other state.
why do you rely on the  in  in distinguishing kyllo, why do you rely on the house if there's no search? why do you have to rely on the fact that there was a house involved there? you  you listed that as one of your three distinctions.
it would be, but i think we came to the conclusion that it probably wasn't because the words, by the supreme court, are not only present in two different places right in this paragraph 6(3), also in 8(2), also in 2244 and in 22  i think  64. and it does seem to be a pattern that where the congress expected a decision by this court in the whole series of statutes, they said, by the supreme court. and it's notably missing from the phrase that says, made retroactive to cases on collateral review.
and  and if  if he were not able to afford a  afford an attorney and one were appointed for him and that lawyer were incompetent, that client would still have to show prejudice. but in your case, you don't have to show anything at all.
why wouldn't that be the case? suppose the 
we agree, mr. chief justice, that the end goal was political in the sense of incumbency protection, but a state may not use race as the means to the end of protecting an incumbent. what happened here was that the only group of voters who had shifted their support away from congressman bonilla were latino. democrats had never voted for congressman bonilla. the problem inside this district was not a problem of democratic voters. it was latino voters who had supported him and withdrawn.
 it doesn't seem to me  for you to prevail, you have to take the extreme position that there can never be a cure.
well, it would be simultaneous. the jury  the jury would have that question. didn't i understand the attorney for the united states to say this is typical of what juries decide, was this person an independent contractor or an employee?
why would an officer, without such permission, want to make a no-knock entry while possessing a warrant 
 you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute? can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?
how far would you go with the mechanik logic? suppose that someone is charged by information with a felony without the person's consent and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss the information and then the person is convicted. would you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict that the fact that the person was charged with a felony by information calls for no remedy?
 very odd to have a regulation on dispensing that takes no account of the purpose for which the drug is being used.
is there something where i can look that up in collier? are there millions of cases? i mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.
justice ginsburg, that's correct. the child was in a private school, at which point in time, the private school suggested that they find  the parents find another environment for the child suitable for what they determined to be "special needs." the parents contacted the local school district, and, at that point, the school district, in conjunction with the parents, devised an educational plan for the child.
in any case, this has nothing to do with the, fobian, so-called fobian issue, whether the ninth circuit drew the bright line.
but 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
that's why asked you. why isn't it  (laughter.)
they're subsections (e), (g), and (k).
records don't have to  typically are not filed with the petition for cert. so the record would be back in the lower court.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
it's conceivable that those five or six states could say, "the president has no authority to do this," ground one. ground two, "even if he did, on the merits, we reexamine." so the whole thing could go away.
this statute is a  about private civil actions, and it doesn't affect the sec's enforcement authority or any action. in fact, the sec doesn't derive any greater power, or lesser power, as a result of the enactment of slusa. it is entirely legislated against private civil actions.
it is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this court's cases 
well, what exactly are you seeking in these enforcement proceedings? an injunction to install the bact or criminal fines or civil fine, or what?
well, as to brooke group and what the court's being asked to do here, justice breyer, is to go down the same path that it did in albrecht versus harold company in '68 when it agreed to treat completely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical resale price restraints. later on, in state oil company vs. kahn the court abandoned and accepted justice harlan's dissent that it was wrong to equate those two.
how's that? the prosecutor goes in and says, we think the defendant has intimidated the witness by saying he's not going to support her financially, he's going to leave, whatever, and  and the  presumably the  the defendant says no  no, and the witness isn't there. the judge says, well, i find by a preponderance of the evidence that he has intimidated her?
 organize 
there's one body of water, your honor  justice stevens.
 "see if you have drugs."
suppose 
 you accepted, it seemed to me, the premise of 
not an improvement exactly, but maybe from the constitution's point of view. that constitution wanted, as they said in the slaughterhouse cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and their children and make them full members of american society. and part of that was that the state couldn't insist that they go to separate schools. now, the question from a constitutional point of view that you're being asked is how could that constitution which says that this is intolerable, that segregated school, and insist that the school boards in swann and elsewhere take the black children and white children and integrate them? how could the constitution the day that that decree is removed tell the school board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back to their black schools and their white schools? that i take it is why the court in swann said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in the public schools when the school board so chooses. now, that's the general question that i think justice ginsburg began and justice souter was following it up. and i would appreciate your response.
i may not be a software developer, but as i read the invention, it's displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them. i  i might have been able to do that.
so that if you had a situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent controlled who was elected by siding with one group or the other group, then you would say that that was an influence district for that small  the smallest group in the district?
no, no, justice 
damages are available?
 if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant. isn't that what you're saying it says?
where is it in the appendix? it said that he  you sue person x, and i take it the reason that you won this case in the fourth circuit  which was surprising to me  was that a person called mr. franzen, who is a resident of virginia, was a partner of the defendant. now, i would like  and, indeed, it was a partnership of which he was a partner. so, if a virginia resident is a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership, then maybe you were right. so, i'm interested in: what is the evidence that mr. franzen was a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership?
but in  in any  or in many campaigns, the  the issues take shape during the process of the campaign, and there are historical events, national events that suddenly occur that people want to comment on. and i  i just don't see that there's any capacity for adjusting so that the public can know how candidates are facing issues that are beginning to emerge that the public has a vital interest in. my understanding was that a quarter-page ad in the burlington newspaper was, i think, $1,400. now, it's  it's gratifying to know that vermonters are splurging on cable television, but it  it  (laughter.)
but none of that  in answer to my earlier question, i thought you said none of that really matters, right? the only thing that matters is that this is a publicly owned facility. you could be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it would come out the same way.
it seems to me he should have been arrested, and the  and the mere fact that the police officer gave the wrong reason for arresting him doesn't make me feel very bad about the arrest at all. i'm glad he was arrested.
suppose, mr. grant, that the district court had said, i'm going to deny the substitution of the united states as the defendant, but i realize that this is a debatable question, so i'm not going to order a remand until the defendant and the united states have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that i deny the substitution of the united states. suppose that it had happened that way? would you have any right to get back in the state court? wouldn't that properly go to a court of appeals?
yes.
what about changing other people's behavior? your  your assertion that it does no good is based upon the fact that it has not altered the behavior of these people who are in the unit. but what about other people who don't want to get thrown in the unit? i mean, don't you have to look at the deterrent effect? and  and is it easy for you to say that the  that  that the in terrorem effect of being deprived of  of literature, television, or whatever has not induced other people to shape up?
mr. phillips, you have two minutes remaining.
i don't think i disagree with that. but there's two separate points here, is that  one is, does congress have to say, "we are now suspending the writ under our suspension clause"? and i don't think there's any call to say that they have to do that. obviously, in cases like st. cyr, this court has been very clear to say, "congress obviously can't stumble upon the habeas clause."
yes.
 medium, or what will fit inside the mailbags. i simply can't give you a number 
he's trying to say, what is  let me take you to the text of the statute 
well, that's 
can i substitute "substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your position or affecting your position?
right. but 208, like 206  maybe i'm not understanding the question. both provisions address only violations of the statute.
exactly, that has to be argument as 3 opposed to some other form of communication 
yes. that's at its peak, perhaps, when you're talking about electronics. when the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be the benefit, which is often the case, you can't free ride on that. you either shop in the place where you like to shop or you shop  or you have a different shopping experience in target.
correct.
respectfully, your honor, it is not the stratosphere. it's the troposphere.
there are about 3,000 
i think that us the logical inference from the six or seven times he says  in variety of  he says this is bigger than william weaver. the one thing you've got to understand is this is far more important than william weaver; this is, goes way beyond william weaver; this does not pertain just to william weaver. he says that on six or eight occasions. and i think you could interpret that  the logical interpretation 
no, but i'm asking what if he did, why should you draw a distinction?
your honor, i think i started with that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke this  this provision. and i'd like to  to continue with that point because the party here is merely an incidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary. under any of the  the tests that have been applied for third party beneficiaries, the party here would not qualify as an intended beneficiary. most importantly, the contracting parties here, the united states and westlands, expressed no intent to give this party enforcement rights. what's more, the contract does not provide that performance would be rendered to  to the petitioners in this case. the contract is quite clear that performance is rendered to westlands. this is a contract in which the united states furnishes a specified amount of water to westlands and westlands pays money for it. westlands then has a separate obligation with regard to the farmers.
and in the brief you say that the government says that this is limited first amendment, and then you say, "these remarkable claims are unsurprisingly false." i thought that was a rather severe charge against the government, that it's misrepresenting its cases.
i mean, why should the doctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what he's doing, why should he be protected?
with respect, justice scalia, i don't think the statutes say that at all. there is a statute, 484(a), that says that the occ's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to national banks. but there is no statute that says that the occ's visitorial authority is not exclusive with respect to subsidiaries. there's another statute that deals with affiliates. now one point is that affiliates are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include for example, i guess brother and sister corporations for lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common parent. but another point is that at the time these statutes were enacted, congress simply didn't have within its field of vision the notion that a national bank would have the power to exercise its functions through a subsidiary corporation.
justice ginsburg, if  if that were the case here, obviously our arguments would be more difficult. but that is not what happened here. if  if 
right.
and you say there has never been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance where, in the absence of the action, the person would have violated the law, if it's a government law. in other words, if they're  so, it's really not 
our position is that if there were a clear abuse of discretion, in accordance with the ordinary mandamus standards 
why is that draconian?
what do you distribute? i mean, i agree you have a, some kind of, let's put something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and each one has a number on it. what are you distributing  the cards? are you, are you  what's distribute  a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. what's it a distribution of?
do you agree that their action is just based on bazemore or their reading of bazemore?
but  but the state's position is that it wants to avoid that ultimate deterrent. it  it wants to take away privileges for a while to see if he can conform. you're depriving the state of the  of the option to avoid the most extreme circumstances of forgetting about him altogether forever.
thank you, counsel. mr. hallward-driemeier, we'll hear now from you.
but i'm not interested  i got that point.
isn't that a separate question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver? isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which is a question of fact, which is a question of whether had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation evidence relating to a history of family violence, he would have persisted in blocking the admission of any mitigation evidence? isn't that the issue? not whether it was knowing and intelligent. that would be a separate legal question.
it doesn't  it doesn't say that. it says other than waters that are themselves wetlands. it excludes all wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the united states.
i can see how they would affect the market if they were disclosed.
well, then the last part of it 
the  well, that  the definition  we would have to return to the ada. if a merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a specified form of public transportation or a public accommodation.
security.
but the question, itself, doesn't refer to the property issue.
do you  does your argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court, wanted to file the habeas application in the district court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it would be premature because the, the state application is still pending?
that's right. that's subject to waiver, which is another 
thank you, mr. goldberger. mr. cole, we'll hear from you.
well, i think, your honor, that the  growing out of pennsylvania coal, the court has recognized that one of the critical factors, if not the most critical factor, in regulatory takings analysis is the character of the government's action and the nature of the government's interest. it's not simply a matter of how much property has been taken. the question is the government's basis for taking that property. when we  what we have here, justice breyer, is a  is a  a right specifically protected by the constitution. the constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. and justice holmes in pennsylvania coal was  said that that seemingly absolute protection is qualified, and the 
well, they couldn't at the time of clemons and stringer. apparently, in the interim, in the 1990s, as is discussed in our brief, they  mississippi changed the interpretation of its statute, so it now has, sort of, an overarching circumstances-of-the-crime aggravation consideration in its sentencing. but that was not the time as of clemons. and, in the footnote in clemons, which  this court referred to the statute of mississippi  it was clear that, at least at the time of clemons, the eligibility factors were the sole aggravation. but the 
do you  do you know of  of any other situation in which a  a time limit is imposed that has nothing whatever to do with the  with the act that the individual is complaining about, nothing whatever to do with the act 
 of semantics 
well, but our statute requires the jury, in the sentencing phase, to make these additional factual determinations about the offense.
no, your honor, i disagree with that.
yes 
that's correct. it would be a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no defendant who would be liable to the plaintiff. but what the court of appeals did here was, it imposed an obligation on the defendants that, in effect, confuses the obligations that are in federal rule of civil procedure 19, which looks at whether there are necessary or indispensable parties. and what the court did was, in effect, to take an unnamed affiliated entity to lincoln and treat it as the 
when, when this plan has  this  the description is yes, basically right. when this plan was suspended in, after the court of appeals enjoined it, the board had, as i said, experienced some considerable disruption in the assignments because of the timing of the injunction. but the board was also looking at the effect of the race-neutral, if you will, program measures that it had implemented. such that now, ingram high school in the north end of seattle is much more popular. nathan hale is no longer over-subscribed. there's less demand for ballard, but there have been 
i'm not sure what it says about the death penalty. on this issue.
would it not be odd to have a  to give assurance that you could buy back what you've lost? does it  would that  that's a very strange construction of the representations attendant upon buffalo creek. i understand what you're talking about with the 5,000 acres.
 he can rely 
i would say two things about that, mr. chief justice. the first thing is, i would strongly resist your characterization that the state court is saying nothing. i think that, in most cases, they are saying something, and that, in the cases that involve postcard denials, many of them, the court is saying that they're timely, and, in others, those are the hard questions. so, i would restrict your characterization to the fact that california is not saying something in some cases. now, because the federal statute necessarily imports a state standard, that's the very problem with the statute. i can conceive of many instances where 
well, the jury certainly knows that they are imposing a death sentence. but what this instruction and the prosecutorial arguments given in the cases tell them is that they can fulfill their responsibilities as jurors without coming to a final judgment about whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa.
but didn't we have competition even within the joint venture for a few months? because  correct me if i'm wrong on the facts. i thought for a few months the  the price differential was maintained. i think there was a 2 cent price differential or something like that. and so long as that was maintained, weren't they competing?
and that's why, justice kennedy, it's a question of congressional intent. the very same congress debated extensively about whether to impose design requirements on foreign ships in the oil pollution act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil tankers.
well 
 question 
at least two, your honor, lagrand and avena, and both involved criminal cases.
okay.
all right. on  on that theory, that there is a non-tax economic purpose, do you still maintain that your theory should have as an element unrelated people?
as the court  yes. as the court has done in walton, the standard in the 
where does the government concede that in a standard d&e the living fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?
suppose the prosecutor said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you  you're  you're motivated by the first amendment. but now that it's here, i have my own independent interest in going ahead.
i know they're not available under title ii, but, i mean, as a constitutional matter, there's certainly nothing barring them, based on what you've told us so far.
well, we think there's  there are two answers to that, chief  mr. chief justice. the first is that, in harris versus christensen, this court said that a federal agent cannot promulgate a new regulation in the guise of interpreting an old one. now, in 1971, when that regulation to which you refer was enacted, it was absolutely clear that the u.s. attorney general could not have de-registered an oregon doctor who was acting in accordance with state law, because, as this court pointed out in united states versus moore, the registration was a matter  was as a matter of right if the  if the physician was in good standing with state medical authorities. so, what he's attempting to do today, in the guise of interpreting that rule, is to make it mean something entirely different than what it meant when he enacted it. and i think christensen versus harris county says that he simply cannot do that.
but why would  why would we impute that  that unconcern to the framers about the  the need to test statements which may very well have  have been given because of envy, grudge, and so on?
the question that is presented to us  whatever they suggested at this oral argument that wasn't in iii, the question it presented to us is, was the federal circuit right when they said, "you have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?
is that a fair statement of your argument?
all right. this is helpful, very helpful to me, but i'm trying to see what you're driving at. i'm imagining the woman saying, he's hitting me, he's just hit me. she's in tears. that's excited utterance. not. then suddenly the officer, 5 minutes later, says i've heard what you said. let's reduce it to writing. here's the formal affidavit, et cetera, that is  but to prevent mr. friedman's problem, we're going to have to say as to the second, that is even if you don't have the formality, you see, everything is the same, but not the formality. now, how do we do that?
oh, i agree with you. that's not the problem.
yes, a preliminary injunction.
well, that's correct. but in the majority of cases  and this is the only testimony in this record, your honors. our experts testified on a study  based on a study which was commissioned for him by the department of justice, a study which has been cited by some of the amicus briefs on both sides in this case, dr. albert testified that 70 percent of the time, when police back off pursuit, the perpetrator stops running and they resume safe driving. and when the car is stolen, most of the time 
so  so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to state law to determine the amount?
mr. marcus, isn't there this  this linguistic problem with the statute anyway? because this language if it said  that sometimes presents a serious risk, then the answer would be obvious. if otherwise it said that characteristically presents a serious risk, then it might be closer. and which do you think is the more normal reading of it? i think either is  certainly fits the language.
he alleged 
how are you supposed to decide it if there's a question as there is this instance i think? i just don't know how dangerous attempted burglaries are. i mean, maybe i'm not supposed to admit there are a lot of things i don't know but there are. and this is one of them.
well, that's wonderful policy 
to put it in context, the subcommittee of the federal courts study committee says zahn is bad law and doesn't make any sense, which by the way, respectfully, i think it is. so then you go to the full committee. the full committee  judge weis doesn't like diversity jurisdiction at all. he wants to abolish all diversity jurisdiction. they make no recommendations.
and  and as we point out in our 20 brief, there's nothing  in this context in particular, a 21 vacatur is like a conviction. it's a fact, you know, that 22 is  is commonly referred to by the court.
the footnote in boyde actually supports more california's position that factor (k) encompasses any other circumstance that would counsel a sentence less than death as opposed to the ninth circuit and payton's interpretation that factor (k) is limited to the crime. in both the first part of footnote 5, the  the  chief justice rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument that the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to the circumstances of the crime. rather, it allowed the jury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has done in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and that involves a consideration of the defendant's background and character. and then the last part of footnote 5 expressly recognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of good character evidence, and good character evidence is only relevant to a decision about whether the person should live or die, not to circumstances related to the crime. and good character evidence under payton and the ninth circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and could not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall under the meaning of factor (k). so the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate broad interpretation that the california supreme court adopted when it applied boyde  boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k) to the analysis of payton's claim. and although they did, in footnote 5, distinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime evidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question. it was simply noting a fact that distinguished the case from skipper. and  and aedpa requires that we follow the holdings of the court and not dicta. so when we start 
okay, in that case there would be confusion, but mark, in that case, would be using "best buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair use defense. because a lot of times when confusion comes up, it comes up in the case that 
no, not as long as the state of oregon agrees that this statute operates in an evenhanded fashion. in other words, if they get to recall witnesses who originally testified, or present transcript testimony, then we should have the same right.
 under the statute.
but you can't get a warrant that says he can do that.
yes, that's right.
so far as first habe goes.
how long is that resolution going to guide our view of the future displays or even the present one? what about the membership of the board of supervisors is changed? how long do we look to that particular resolution?
okay, well, what do you say to 
well 
i think it's clear that the michigan courts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply inserts himself into a relationship without formal court appointment is not entitled to be paid.
we're talking about challenges where there are no  no obvious basis for it.
your honor, that would solve the constitutional problem in this case, but i believe it is not the best course for three reasons. first, as this court has already discussed, the states around the country have adopted at least 10 different medical emergency definitions. and this court has no way to know which if any of those formulations 
could they work that out? that is, if two-thirds of our universe really is american-based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking about conflicts in  real conflicts that  that affect, say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities get together and they try to write memoranda that  that work this out in a reasonable way. could  could the same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?
all right. i wanted to make sure 
our submission is that they cannot, your honor. now, if i could turn to the partisanship issue, our 
okay. so  so what would be so unreasonable about a member of congress concluding the following? we want these things to end after 6 years, you know? and there's never been an example of this horrible that you think of, and so we are going to end them all after 6 years from the time the thing took place, the cheat took place. and that's it. and if there's some other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes up, we will worry about that later through amendment, tolling, et cetera. why is that an  we don't want 30-day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of limitations. we want 6 years. that helps most people. and if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about it. what's the answer to that?
what would be arbitrary and capricious? you told us harassing would be the repeated searches by the same officer.
but what  what if there's a third possibility and  and the lawyer makes remarks in front of the jury, as  as this lawyer did, in effect, concession kind of remarks, and the defendant stands up and says, hey, i'm not making those concessions? i am not guilty. i'm not conceding a darned thing. does the lawyer at that point at least have a  an option to proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his performance under strickland afterwards?
well, it  the answer, your honor, is, i'd ask the court to look to page 3 of our brief, where the statute is set forth, and look carefully at the way that statute is worded, which says, "either party may recall any witness who testified at the prior trial or sentencing proceeding and may present additional relevant evidence."
right.
your honor, i think it would operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would be required to establish an anticompetitive effect resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that burden is overcome the defendant would be required to come up with some legitimate business justification, some pro-competitive results that outweigh that. and only if they could do that would they succeed.
that was  that was the consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation. i mean, that didn't  didn't 
the invention, to use an old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the control.
 and the provisions on (e), (g), and (k)  924 begins on page 3a of the appendix, and (e) begins on 5a, and you can pick up  (g) is on 6a, (k) is on 7a.
i don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. take, for example, the internet. a posting goes on of a  of a business that  a startup company. it can't  damages of  for a startup company  they're very difficult to prove.
i think it might depend on the nature of the claim actually. if the nature of the claim 
why?
it  it was raised in the  in the state trial court, your honor.
really?
mr. kester, may i ask you this question? is it your view that gen-probe represented a change in the law?
the person who is in this semi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he's at his workplace, the police officer shows up and says, "i'm going to pat you down, and then i'm going to" 
just as we did in garner?
the case is submitted.
i  it  it adds to the general appeal of your case i  i suppose, but what does that have to do with whether or not it's testimonial?
no, i do not.
mr. kirkpatrick, i don't recall what  what the rule is. does notice have to be given by registered mail? would it  would it be adequate notice in the  in the ordinary case to send notice by regular mail?
so, you're not  i thought your position was: vmi, okay. if they filed a claim, then they're open to affirmative recovery if it's a compulsory counterclaim; offset, if it's a permissive counterclaim. but i thought you said, as to the three other schools, no waiver. there's not  no way you can lump them in. i thought that was 
what  what 
well, you also don't allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats. everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the trial; isn't that right?
it, it does not become meaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that are clearly post deprivation such as filing for an injunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to stop a foreclosure. those are still viable under 7426 and would fall within the nine-month period but essentially congress has permitted two different complementary actions to seek a refund.
 when she is  she is in  in  supposedly in great fear of  of her husband and  and  i'm sure you'd rather have the telephone call.
well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.
was the court below wrong in saying that the statute was enacted only to help generic-drug development?
thank you, mr. moran.
so, presumably, that could provide some cause of action, quite irrespective of the icj decision.
well, rule 36 says the court may correct clerical errors at any situation. but that, your question presupposes that we know what happened in the grand jury room, that it should have been an indictment, they intended it to be in the indictment 
that really depends, doesn't it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if it's correct, if the manufacturer  if the claim on behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the customers want is service, the retailers are in at least as good a position to identify that fact as not. i think the point 
that  that was at least an underlying concern of her question, and i think it's a legitimate concern.
but it seems 
mr. chief justice, there is rationale for having a short statute, but once again i point out that you have two statutory schemes which appear to be able to be harmonized and coexist together. 1346 constitutes or at least the language is clear and unequivocal in its waiver of sovereign immunity for a third party who desires to collect a tax that's been taken from that third party. and with that construction, it seems to me that only congress can  can deal with the question that you've just raised, if congress wants to make it.
 to be injured.
what about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was  that was cited to us, that  that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?
 kansas highways, presumably.
justice scalia, you will find it  first of all, mercy is referred to in paragraph  in instruction number 4 
no. no. the 
that's right. and this court can look several places, but it can first look to these  this regulatory regime that was created, which was always thought of as being triggered by section 276. and then asking 
there are  there are other 
no. but i mean, that's not  that's not the issue. i'm not asking you about res judicata. i'm saying that if he comes into court and, as justice ginsburg suggested in her hypo, his experts demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that there will, in a certain number of cases, be excruciating pain, and he is at least within the risk of that, your response is we're still  that is no grounds for enjoining the execution under 1983. we can still execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a less painful way of doing it. and what i want to know is, why does he have such an obligation? why isn't it enough for him to show that there is a probability that he will suffer excruciating pain?
we're not saying about what needs to be charged. we're talking about what was charged. and it seems to me there's no question what was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle. there is no way you can consider that an accessory.
if it's just anecdotal, no. it has to be 
was there anybody in that case who  since i wrote it, i guess i'm supposed to know it in detail, but i don't  [laughter.]
i agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about. isn't that so? it says the  i think so  it says a parent is to be reimbursed. i thought that was one of the things that 
well, that's  that's once it's granted. it's not, the time limit is 180 days or the seven day after you received or became aware actual notice 
which would not? i'm sorry.
i 
the 
it's a good question. (laughter.)
i am not  i am not aware of any. on the other hand, like mr. moran, i  other than anecdotal evidence, i have no statistical evidence that the police are violating the knock-and-announce principle since the decision in stevens.
so it has nothing to do, essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests.
substantively different?
you really haven't limited the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.
not  not the right of appeal. the right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory or 
well, we did point to the statute, your honor, and suggest that the congress had made it available. i think the other reason why the implied repeal doctrine is not the right analysis here is that section 7426 did not withdraw any substantive rights. this, the trust here is simply trying to take advantage of another remedial provision, 1346, and rename its cause of action. they're bringing exactly the same  their complaint is substantively identical to the complaint they brought in their first action.
well, mr. chief justice, if it turns out that it's too hard and  and the  and a specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d) requires that an injunction not issue. and in fact, as we've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, i think, 19 of our brief, the federal circuit has, in fact, overruled injunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy rule 65. but the claim of imprecision here is  look, i'm not a software developer and i have reason to believe that neither is your honor, and i  i can't  (laughter.)
well, how 
all right.
would you clear up one thing for me? you say it's always the doctor's intent to extract as much as possible before causing fetal demise. i thought there was significant number of cases in which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal demise before i start any extraction?
 they're pledgeable.
arkansas set up a statutory scheme that gave him a right to redeem up until 30 days after the sale of the property. that statutory right  he gets due process whether he's innocent or not innocent. and i think in the case where 
yes, by all means.
no. now, that's 
again, i think what crawford was talking about, in terms of trying to understand the confrontation clause, was not simply to hypothesize various problems that different types of evidence could present if it weren't cross examined, but instead to examine more particularly what the founders were concerned about. and that was not one of the  of the categories simply 
about, approximate.
of course, if congress had thought it had successfully abrogated, there would be no reason to provide for a waiver, i don't suppose.
i mean, i think that assisted suicide would have been as unthinkable at the time this was enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational use.
well, i think we're talking about two separate things. is your honor's question presupposing a single-count case or a multi-count?
okay. so that's 
oh, i think this court can do anything it chooses, regardless of the government's concession. (laughter.) but we're not conceding that the ninth circuit was correct. we simply didn't challenge it because the important question for us is the rule of law on harmless error. this pleading rule is something that we can comply with. it may be wrong, but it's something, like many wrong rules of law, we live with.
well, is there any reason not  did the  did the district court explain that it was rejecting that element of the witnesses' testimonies?
yes. the turner standard certainly reflects a consideration by this court that deference is appropriate with regard to rights which are inconsistent with incarceration.
no, not at all, your honor, and i believe that the whole intent of goss versus lopez was to allow a high school student to understand the interpretation of the principal's view of the facts, and allow the student the opportunity to clarify or to fill in any missing points in terms of the understanding being 
regardless of 
well, no, i agree that the  i  in my view, the key to the case is in 1101(a)(43), official because, if you look at the structure of 1101(a)(43)  and this gets to the question you  you said  you mentioned that i had three reasons. one is that under the  under the ina, the conviction consequences turn on the conviction of an aggravated felony, and it only makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to determine the nature of the crime, whether it's a felony.
what  you  you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the federal employee, saying i'm entitled to a certain coverage or i'm entitled to certain benefits. you would expect that suit to be in federal court. but why would you expect what piece of the tort recovery the carrier will get to be in federal court?
pardon me?
but this 
yes, because i think if the judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in that case 
 that's certainly 
well, your honor, the alternative, if you go sort of the government's route here, is to essentially perpetuate the confusion that brought us here in the first place. the government essentially argues, well, you can't waive, but sometimes you can waive. we're not quite  we're not going to tell you exactly when you can waive. that's going to put district judges in a  in a worse position, in a more confused position.
has any judge ever taken the view that  adopting justice scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole ira  exempt the whole ira, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?
 precisely the point, that the tribe would probably not like to pay the taxes that are paid by the distributor or the refiner or the person that brings the fuel  the petroleum product out of the ground. what it  what it simply means is, the margin between the cost and the sale, that's what the tribe would like. it's perfectly understandable. but it would like to have that and  that tax  and i'd like to save the balance of my time for rebuttal  but that tax is overwhelmingly used on the roads of kansas  overwhelming used on the roads of kansas  which are paid for, built, and maintained with the revenue produced by that taxation. that's what it's for.
it often is. it can be made 
 your honor, i didn't 
they want to maintain, first of all, their independent identity just like citizens publishing. they want to maintain that. they had a standstill agreement you can't merge these. they didn't want to join them. they didn't want to make a new product. they didn't want to do that. all they wanted to do was fix the price of gasoline in the united states.
and your honor, to the extent that i would certainly agree that those arguments based on the strength of the case were not necessarily 
but shabani rested on  on the existence of these prior models. shabani didn't create them.
 not 
they were relying 
well, i don't understand congress to have made credibility findings. as i read the  i read the whole finding. there were six or seven pages of findings, and i don't find a single reference in those findings to the performance of an abortion on a nonviable fetus. all of the language in the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just inches away from becoming a person. and i don't think you can even find the word fetus in those findings. the findings as opposed to the text of the statute.
yes.
well, the government distinguishes that case. what do you make of their distinction?
one can look at it that way, your honor. but i think if one looks at it that way then i think this court's cases in brown and block are how you apply the implied repeal analysis when a specific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by application of a more general statute. and that's particularly true where it's uncertain at the time congress enacted the specific statute.
well, it just does not make it testimony. and if it  the prosecutor in the 911 case had said, i don't have her testimony, i have something better, it's a 911 call 
and the reason that it didn't violate section 2, i want to know, is what? because you have the three preconditions which seem to be met, and then you have some kind of  it doesn't violate section 2 from de grandy if, despite the preconditions, there is some kind of overall proportionality. but all that is rather unclear in my mind, and i want to know what your view of it is.
i think it's uncontested that 19 all three looked into that, but the point that has been 20 made is that the last two went beyond that. do you 21 disagree with that?
well, there was a 1-day miscalculation, justice ginsburg, on the  on the 352 versus 353 days before the  mr. day filed his state postconviction petition. but there's a legal dispute as to whether the days after  between the time  whether the 
well, yes, but  but that is  that's not equivalent to saying that it's  it is subjecting the united states to suit.
what are the alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on by the federal circuit?
that's really all it means. and this court last term in muhammad in  in footnote 1 made clear that the incarceration that matters for this analysis is the  in the incarceration of the sentence from the state court. and i think that's  that's what the court needs to look at, is what is johnson's effect on the state court judgment or sentence. what's the necessary implications? not in this case at all. and really, this case i think has already been decided by wolff. it's something that the petitioners sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. in wolff, the prisoners in  in that case were trying to get their good-time credits back. i think this is an easier case than the wolff decision. and what the court did was parse out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the processes that are used in connection with depriving prisoners of good-time credits. and that's precisely what johnson is seeking here. your honor, the other thing i wanted to mention was the notion  your honors, the other thing i want to mention was the notion that there's no state review of these decisions. the prison litigation reform act clearly provides for state administrative review of even challenges to the process. so the  the state of ohio could easily set up an appeal process administratively to  to correct that problem.
it would relate to the gravity  to circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime, for purposes of a jury's sentencing determination. and the point i'd like to make on that point is this, your honor. in california, jurors are well aware what their task is at a sentencing determination. in california, the guilt and the death eligibility determinations are made during the guilt-phase trial and the jurors are expressly told, during the penalty-phase trial, that their lone determination, their one concern, is to decide between a sentence of death or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. and, in that light, the jurors are very well aware that their only determination in a california case is to make a moral, normative determination, a single normal  moral normative determination, as to whether this man, this defendant standing before them in this court today, deserves death or life without possibility 
justice breyer, you're correct that if the court concludes this district is not reasonably compact, then under its precedents, it wouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting rights violation, but 
to go to one more aspect of the statute which i don't think you've addressed, congress said that  with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, i think, other things  that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not. except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution. but it seems to me that congress thought of the wire/mail fraud statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to be the object of the scheme to defraud.
but realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this court would grant cert on such a question is very slim.
correct.
that's true, mr. chief justice. but if you took that to its logical conclusion, then, when state courts made errors  they didn't see that a case was properly filed, they just missed it  the federal court would go in and review. or in a case where they did claim the reverse, the federal court could say, "no, there was clear error." but this court has rejected that in saffold. it's rejected it in pace. and  because that is informed by the very view that the tolling provision was included to encourage one round of state exhaustion free of federal interference.
were there  before gen-probe was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that were decided?
no. well, all right. were they  there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant. given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?
where the  where the licensee brought suit challenging validity while the license was still in full 
but that's a different question. the immunity looks to where the money is going to come from to satisfy a judgment. i don't think it looks to where the funding came from in the first instance.
but how can you know whether the problems are ongoing if the new rules haven't been implemented?
 the thrust of our arguments before this court were directed towards the conviction. the other side then raised, oh, the state has waived their claim about the sentencing, and  and we were just making 
the scow is absolutely a vessel.
in the 
thank you, mr. grant. mr. hallward-driemeier.
but the jury answered the  just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.
ms. maynard.
 with the ipod, and 
congress adopted that.
yes. i mean, first of all, i'd  i'd say that the  the court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we 
well, the 
i don't have any public records to  to be able to say one way or another. we were denied all public records whenever we were proceeding in state court.
 "a fraud."
but this is with a specific investigative tool.
i think they'd be called reliance damages. you know, i used to teach contract law. we would call it reliance damages.
i don't even know  i am so ignorant i don't even know if schad is a federal case or a state case.
that's correct, your honor.
right.
it's the same thing. but i wouldn't call it 
the second point is that there are other displays in this court. as a person walks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom, they don't see the ten commandments in a display with a bunch of law givers. instead, they see the ten commandments alone with an eagle above it.
clearly.
and who  what was dr. blake's background?
your honor, once these are emitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is imminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is imminent harm. it may take 
well, you mentioned 
thank you, mr. gold. the case is submitted.
isn't that concern present in granberry, as well? and yet, the court reached the opposite result there.
 or demotions.
the police report was prepared earlier, but when the crime  when they wrote down guilty, the offense he was guilty of is breaking into a certain address at a certain day, belonging to a certain victim, and involving the same arresting officer. and we believe that 
that is absolutely correct. nonadversarial administrative proceedings would, themselves, not be actions.
 that's the plain meaning.
is the ada an applied term of that contract?
and that's nothing special to 7 pennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to 8 use a certain file.
no, no. my hypothetical is he says it's a 3-year enhancement if the deadly weapon is a firearm. that's  what i'm asking is, in effect, under washington law, is it error if the judge allows the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury so it can find a lesser included offense.
that would be  in the money laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h), that would be where the overt act occurs. so it would be consistent with it. our 
well, are you 
 the commerce clause.
my point is only terminological, and that is, when the eeoc used those words, it did not do so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several times  and they are quoted in our brief  that the standard  and this is just the bottom line. i think it's a very important bottom line.
you don't say, "oh, you've granted a question; therefore, you have to decide whether you have jurisdiction or not."
right. and you agree that the 
no, it wouldn't. justice scalia, i official think, has captained that position. and what we're saying is the fcc can pick a fair rate once it is something that long distance providers or any common carrier ought to be compensating somebody for. but what we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative creature. and then it gets to the second reason why 
they can logically because they say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a contract that is voidable  i.e., a and b enter into a contract. b says it's voidable. i void it. i void it. and there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable  you go to arbitration. but if it's void, where b doesn't have to say i void it, i void it, you never had a contract in the first place. now, that is a logical position.
i don't have a warrant to search 1518. i don't have a warrant that allows me to come in in the middle of the night when it says day, and i don't have a warrant here that allows me to come in without knocking. so where's the warrant?
all right 
where  where it  where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts? if you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?
apart from that, apart from the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we specified what factors the jury can take into account by way of mitigation?
and it's not that white children and black children are no longer sitting together on the same school benches?
if it's possible, at least, that we just overlooked that aspect in the issuance of our opinion, would it be more helpful to move on to the other two questions at issue here, since they would be determinative? it's 
well, as an  as an alternative, the court could remand back to have the sixth circuit 
then are you saying, look, judge  imagine you had a jury on this question. if the defendant has made out enough of a case that you would send it to the jury, then go to step two and ask the questions as to why.
yes.
really?
let me ask you this question, if i may. perhaps i should have asked mr. phillips. is there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence? i understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's official burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence. but that doesn't sound to me like any overriding doctrine of equivalence. it just says when they wrote the restatement, the rules were the same. is there such a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?
thank you, mr. olson. mr. hungar?
i don't know if i'm getting  so that's his basic point. the rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their  within their discretion. statute doesn't require it and the constitution doesn't require it. we have to go to the constitution, i don't see exactly the implications. so i'm nervous. and now, the reports  he says, go read 7460(b). that's what they're talking about. and then  and again, i don't know what i'm getting into once i read it more broadly than that. and what about all evidence received by the tax court, including a transcript. of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. and  and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.
that's right because defense is based on the order of suits. those are preclusion defenses, and preclusion defenses are not immediately appealable. and, you know, i think this follows from the court's decision in  in irwin that  that certain defenses that are available to private parties in litigation should also be available, treated the same way, have the same rules when the government is being sued like a private party.
i'm not aware, your honor, of any precedents 
well, but as i understand it, the  the system as a whole is not challenged as violating the fourth amendment.
how about the sanitation department?
same as any corporation.
i'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal court in the country having over the bench a replica of the ten commandments and opening each session with prayer.
yes.
i believe that's correct. when you file a motion, a 20 day notice is required, yes.
i do not join 
the  those facts under title vii must be proved more likely than not. and from that, under the title vii mcdonnell douglas formula 
no, your honor. there is no order in this record explaining why the mandate did not issue.
can we take this concrete case? hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.
it's quick and dirty. we haven't tried to slice the baloney too thin in this area, have we? we  we  (laughter.)
 needed protection of the  of the supervising powers, or whatever they're called.
the cost of testing and evaluation, which is  which is a crucial component of the statute  those costs have been awarded.
i  i think 
no, but they also use the term, civil action, and it seems to me that your interpretation of the two differs if  if the city of chicago 
no, that  at least not if it's part of his job duties. and i would think 
absolutely, your honor. if the  in a  when a  when a court has a collegial deliberative process involving more than one person that is involved in the decision-making  certainly this is an unusual process in that  and there is no identical analog, but we see no due process problem.
does it make  what's worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided dabit since this case was brought. then i thought, well, could we remand this case in light of dabit. now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately, slightly confused situation continue to exist. what would be the consequence of that? are there  are there a lot of cases, or is this something that comes up often?
and  and  yes, justice ginsburg. and that's a distinction between your hypothetical and justice breyer's. justice breyer's, as i  if i understand it correctly, is that the federal suit starts after the state court is done. yours is where you have parallel actions at the same time. and where the federal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our case, you can't say that the moment you file those that you're seeking review of some nonexistent state court judgment. you're simply asking for relief from something that your adversary did to you. and the argument that sabic makes that the court relinquishes jurisdiction has no basis or justification in anything this court has ever said. it is a theory of vanishing jurisdiction that i cannot understand.
but if  but your  but your answer earlier to justice souter's earlier question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere and they make their way to the navigable water, you're covered. right?
thank you. the case is submitted.
no, but the basis for differentiation was years of service, was it not?
 if justice breyer 
which was a federal issue.
my  i believe that attorneys don't allow themselves to be placed in that position. they get the contingent fee agreement signed when the  the 
but isn't that somewhat inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district? why did they do it then?
i think that because if it's a jury trial and the case is still  and the jury is still there, it could be done without violating the double jeopardy clause.
but 
but i 
it certainly matters from the defendant's point of view too. in many of these cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been  as in this case, you have delivery drivers. you have owners whose wives are employed in the business.
okay.
no. i'm not questioning whether we could do it. i'm questioning whether congress could do it, whether congress could overrule what we did in davis. if davis said that common law was that the government has to prove  disprove insanity, wouldn't that have been part  become part of the due process clause if it was the common law?
so she  that was  august was the first opportunity she had to apply?
i don't 
 my only 
well, your honor, the sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken into account all of the factors. in the very first guideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself said it could not take into account all of the facts that play into human conduct.
 to and from the 
that's a fair point, justice kennedy, but that doesn't 
but i don't understand.
it's at least an argument.
the district court has to accept that he hasn't waived. and what it's sent back for is for all of the facts that show  that show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.
that's right, justice ginsburg, and that's exactly why this defense is effectively reviewable after final judgment as opposed to now.
 that the child have an iep.
where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?
this trial. he made that argument at this trial. these restraints were visible throughout the trial. there were 15 recesses, at which time deck would have had to stand up when both the jurors leave the court and come back in. the shackles dehumanized deck and it degraded the dignity of the courtroom. prison clothing does not relate to character, and shackles directly relate to character, which is so key in the death analysis. it was not reasonable to impose these excessive restraints after deck had behaved appropriately at  at numerous proceedings prior to this. and for these reasons, we would ask the court to find that there was a constitutional violation 
 that's not the question.
we believe 
i think it would depend on whether the mandate was stayed by the court of appeals. if  if  i think it's pretty 
in the penalty phase?
assuming they don't have a leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face what the alternative to a brooke group kind of instruction is. and  and however they may have tried their case, we've still got the same problem.
but they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.
better shot than  better shot than what? better shot than the  than the free exercise clause alone would allow?
i suppose he could have come here on direct.
it did say that.
well, i think that's right, your honor, but the difference here is that the statute in section 1412(a)(10)(c)(2), and this is on page 6a of petitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to parents to seek reimbursement for the  for their  the educational expenses that they incur. and while the parents have to show that there was a denial of a free appropriate public education, we think it's clear that the statute makes the claim the parent's claim. and there are cases, for example, out of the fourth district, in emery, that would suggest that it is not even clear that the child would have standing to assert a claim for reimbursement when they're not out of pocket any expenses. so we think in a case like this, this is an easy case. we think clearly here the parents are the parties.
no, no. i thought justice souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's instruction might cause confusion because of it. but i don't see how adding it to both of them when you're dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict, i don't see how that can be confusing.
 what's the difference?
but wasn't the district court incorrect in that? because as i understand it, there was evidence from one of the two witnesses who put in the confession evidence that she had gone to the sheriff's department to  to tell them about the confession and had simply gotten a runaround and finally left. so as i understand it, the  the record would not support the finding that  that the  the sources of evidence simply kept silent for over a decade.
my question basically i think you might have been going after is, i was saying that i agreed with you in that there is more evidence supporting your side in these cases than there was before congress, than there was in first stenberg.
that's right, your honor, and the act 
yes, and that's what  well, there  there are two frauds going on. the first one is discovered and the price drops substantially. and i thought you were trying to attribute that drop to the other product.
i don't think this court has ever held any such thing, and i think it would be inconsistent with at least feldman itself. the idea of  of appellate jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in feldman that were held not to be barred comes down in the end  sabic says, well, those claims weren't actually litigated. but the opinion itself on page 467 points out that the mr. feldman had raised his constitutional claims in front of the d.c. court of appeals in terms of asking for his waiver. and when i checked the oral argument transcript from the feldman case, it was mentioned specifically in terms of mr. feldman had raised the constitutional claims in front of the d.c. court. and that's on pages 9, 14, and 16 of the lexis version of the oral argument transcript.
yeah, but why isn't it applicable to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation to order restitution? and it seems to me that the restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out collection in justice breyer's example.
and we don't contend that it was a perfect instruction. we think it would be perfectly appropriate if 
is it always  is it always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee always gets fairly compensated?
yeah, but patent 
not 
and the jury found  there are five.
yes, your honor.
but they did not 
there are, justice ginsburg. and the analysis goes to whether or not  - how far along in the proceeding the litigation has occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice. of course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants, without any consequences, and the courts have fairly uniformly held that it  that it is no jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non-diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity would be present. had this complaint been brought in federal court, there is no doubt that the court would have had original jurisdiction, because, on the face of the complaint, the two named defendants were completely diverse.
but 
why 
i think that 
you don't have a motive to answer that question right away.
well, he may have been the reason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms of the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged, was clearly jwm. it's jwm whose contracts were supposedly breached. and  and the point is, your honor, the  the law has made it clear that simply breaching a contract in a manner that makes it more difficult for somebody else to perform is not a sufficiently direct cause of the  of the failure to perform all of the succeeding downstream contracts. otherwise, the  the rules of privity would simply be eroded. and so instead, it's a very narrow category of cases where a breach of contract can be viewed as the direct cause of another party's failure to perform a separate contract with the plaintiff. and let me give you an example, just to  to show what it's talking about. if, for instance, there is a contract where i am the defendant and i have the right to approve an assignment, and the plaintiff has a contract with a third party and i refuse to approve that assignment. then i have retained the legal control under the terms of my contract as to whether the plaintiff's contract can be performed or not. and in that circumstance, if  if i deny approval on the basis of race, i have made it literally impossible for the other parties to perform. and that's the  the narrow exception. it's either inducing the breach, inducing the breach of a contract, or it's making it literally impossible, but not simply making it more expensive or more difficult. and  and i think it's important to emphasize why these rules were developed under the common law this way. in  in part, it is to protect the very reasonable and legitimate interests of  of innocent third parties. in  in  take the corporate context. if general motors has a dispute with a major customer, and imagine that there is some sense that that  that the customer may have breached its contracts because it  it thought gm's work force had too many black faces, gm has got to figure out what to do about that. it's not going to capitulate and fire its work force, but it has to decide whether it wants to settle, whether it wants to litigate. it may litigate and then want to settle. but that's its claim, its contract claim, and it has to have the freedom to figure out how it ought to be settled. if every black employee at gm could file an action under section 1981 for emotional distress or for wage increases that they might not have gotten because gm lost this big piece of business, then gm would lose the ability to control the settlement of its own claim. and so  and it's an innocent party in this fact pattern. so the law has been designed under  under the common law to make sure that everybody's interests are sufficiently protected. and what the ninth circuit's, you know, ruling does here and what the plaintiffs are really asking for is to just blow through all of those rules that  that have been designed to  to make sense out of contracts  contract laws and still allow some room for tortious interference sorts of principles. and under  under the court's cases, i don't think there is any basis to think that congress intended the court to create an implied right of action that is completely divorced from the common law principles that would have foreclosed these kinds of remedies.
 are you arguing that trial court, even though there's agreement  understanding on most of the historical facts, is still in a better position to make the judgment call as to whether it was voluntary or not?
 to determine 
that's correct, your honor.
 what is alleged in the amended complaint is that in the burroughs of queens and the bronx, these are the only two competitors. only two. they are head-to-head competitors. we allege in the 
it has to be both.
it didn't contain the bar at the time that they said, "you can collect it." in the later statute, which said, "you now can collect out of social security," when they passed that, did it contain a 10-year bar?
so, how would you describe the privacy interest that the knock-and-announce rule is protecting?
well, justice ginsburg, i think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the  how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know  and  and in this  and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the ward test. and  and i think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or  then that  that would be a  a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. but at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. so 
there was a sovereign party who said: i'm out of this; i have suit immunity. and that was the b.c. 
this is a facial attack. what in the world is the matter with that, saying you were referred for the following reasons and leaving space to have it filled out? is that defective under the due process clause?
of course. that is not 
it was two to one in the ninth circuit.
i understand. mr. chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. suppose a state does not have a civil action for extortion. it provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. why does the constitution not permit us to treat, in that state at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?
do we know 
i'm sorry. you go ahead.
and he's talking about the parents of students in the school?
the court of appeals didn't decide that. but, tellingly, i think, as justice breyer suggested, the court of appeals  and i think your question has suggested  it seems that they think there is no liability there. the premise of the court of appeals' holding was that there is no private-party analog. justice breyer, if there is no private-party analog, if you conclude that this type of regulatory activity has no private-party analog, the only appropriate answer under the federal tort claims act is that the united states cannot be liable. you cannot 
then you win without this fancy doctrine.
under  under that reading, no statute would authorize the  the payment of costs.
the first question.
you would bring, your honor, a state quiet title action, as grable did in michigan court, and allege, as the basis for the superiority of plaintiff's title in that case, the violation of federal statute by the federal agents. and therefore, the purchaser at this federal tax sale, darue engineering in this case, does not have superior title.
and that was the point that the seventh circuit made clear in  in its 
and in primary jurisdiction, would we refer it to the sec and accept the sec's fact determinations and then instruct the jury that 
well, my understanding was that the washington law  washington legislature didn't amend its law to say that this could be submitted to a jury. and then every defendant at the outset of the case, would say you need to, you know, strike the indictment, dismiss this charge 
 jurisdiction is limited to reviewing a final judgment in this case.
do we need  do we need a clear statement for united states ships? i thought your case rested on a clear statement requirement. is there any clear statement requirement for u.s. ships?
it notes a number of issues or classifications there or points. first, that the wetland is not adjacent to navigable water. it then notes the wetland is not adjacent to headwater. and then it makes a comment. it says, to a tributary to navigable water, and it says, no. the sole basis for jurisdiction in that report is the migratory bird rule. the respondent took out to the property who they believed to be the most credible expert they had on migratory birds and then state that the 
so, how is it 
 include that language.
 juice this morning. [laughter.]
well, if  if i could answer in two parts. first, to say that i think what was going on in 1964 in the civil rights act, obviously, you have congress in title vii addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title vi, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. and to use justice souter's analogy, in '72 congress takes the title vi model and not the title vii model. now, to get to your question specifically, i think, about sullivan is at the heart of your question, sullivan  i think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on sullivan. first, with all due respect to this court, sullivan itself is pretty opaque. it certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary 
that was the deal.
all right. now, his claim  let's assume he claims this. there is evidence from  from which you  you could infer that he wasn't committing a crime. he may or may not be right, but let's assume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says, yes, there's some evidence that would indicate that he wasn't up there robbing at the time he stood next to the car. assume the judge accepts that. he then says, on that assumption, i want a lesser-included offense instruction of simple murder, killing with intent. is that a lesser-included offense under  under capital murder?
i do make that argument, and to the extent  and  and i make that argument, but that argument was rejected in the court below which addressed it with a completely different approach. and so i begin in this court by having to address where i was in the eleventh circuit court of appeals.
your honor, i don't  i think that you're  that he would pay the tax in that instance 
it wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for justice breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire.
all right. so, therefore, if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean, congress would have both removed the state lawsuits in 2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the exceptions. but that would have the statute defeat itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing came to a correct result.
well, justice stevens, we're not relying on the inference of the 
he is bound by that, your honor. and if i could 
i want to be clear 
 to that case? your case is that, if one out of ten who share the common room says to the police, "you may not come in," that controls?
 that person may have another piece of property in the  in the other state.
 really is whether the plain language of the twenty-first amendment allows that very protectionism.
yes, exactly. that was precisely the point i was going to make, in terms of a hypothetical. we're not arguing  as i tried to indicate earlier, we're not arguing that you need to resolve every question today about what is, or is not, causally related. and there are circumstances where a spontaneous declaration  you know, the police break through the door, and the defendant says, "the drugs are in the closet," and you want to use that declaration to tie him to the drugs  that may well be causally connected. all we're asking today is for this court to decide that the items  the physical evidence found within a proper scope, a search of proper scope of the warrant that's being executed  is not causally connected. other questions of spontaneous declarations, tying the defendant by position to the chair, those may present different issues. but the drugs that were named in the search warrant as items to be searched for and seized are not causally connected; they are the fruit of the execution of the judicial command, not of the knock-and-announce violation.
well, i'm not sure. when you have facial discrimination against out-of-state products, i think you're  the bar is a little higher than that.
thank you, mr. kasner. mr. hungar.
i thought, if you sue a, and then it turns out a doesn't own the building, well, then you've got to sue b.
the answer to that, i think, is no, if i understand your hypothetical, if the employer was not intending to classify on the basis of gender.
we would submit that that is not testimonial within the meaning of crawford for many of the same reasons that  that are present in this case. but it is a different case from this.
and could it be if the officer knows that this package  let's say it's loaded with dynamite or guns or drugs  is going to be delivered at a certain time and it  the delivery occurs, and then the officer busts in and says, there's exigent circumstances. they're going to take those drugs and they'll be off the premises. that might happen.
 in a common law ejectment action that we are supposing that what's going to come up is the tax sale.
well, neither does due process.
 do in those circumstances?
but you couldn't get summary judgment. your reply brief said, "this case is so clear that we should get summary judgment." if inducement is the theory  you have just said, you have to show intent 
i 
yes, mr. chief justice. but actually the term  the definition of enterprise in rico starts with the word includes and it also states any union or group of individuals associated in fact, though not a legal entity. the word union is not defined. according to mohawk, union should be interpreted to mean a labor union, but that makes no sense structurally because the first part of that definition includes legal entities, and if reference were being made by congress to a labor union, then the union would have been inserted in that part of it because at the time rico was written in 1970, congress had already enacted the labor management relations act of 1946, which made labor unions suable entities.
well, i  i think that this court has made clear that the core element of fairness is protecting the defendant's ability to have a lawyer there at all, and if the lawyer is not there, the essential fairness of the trial is in jeopardy. and it's for that reason 
 appendix 2 
have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?
 fighting a war.
may i ask this question? suppose the police report had been ambiguous and referred to both a boat and a house. what would  could  would it be  what would you do in that case?
why was that a middle case? because in merrell dow, the state of ohio had product liability tort law 
yes, your honor, which 
under texas law  and the court of appeals opinion, the grinnell opinion cited by the court of appeals opinion, says this, as does dean powers. under texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort. it is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. it is an element of a  the tort  the claim of product defect related to warnings. and so it is not possible under texas law, settled texas law. other states are different, but texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of defective product by failure to warn, and that 
your honor, because of 
dealt with includes, it seems to me, 1231(a)(6).
well, presumably, your honor, that  only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be attributable to the  the named representative's recovery would be included in the named representative's gross income. i don't think that the named representative would be on the hook, if you will, for all of the attorney's fees that would relate to other class members' recoveries. but i think what all this points out is that 
yes, your honor.
i've looked through the appendix, actually. i read the joint appendix, insofar as the opinion cited it. and it cited, in the opinion, several  five factors  and i guess there are no others, though you can bring them out if there were  that supported you. and the only two that seemed to say that it had something to do  - that seemed to have anything at all to do with suggesting that there was no diversity  was mr. fred chaney, which said that it was a partnership and not a company. i read that. that didn't seem to me to be what he said. and then somebody called mr. lebeau, who said that franzen is a senior vice president and  a virginia resident  and partner in lincoln property. so, i looked up that, and it was on, like, page 273 and, i think, 173 there. and they asked mr. lebeau, and he says, "lincoln operates through many different structures, and i don't know what they were using here." am i right  -
 that really no one else 
1331 was applicable there as well. right?
your honor, under section 1519, now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior, because it  congress has now, basically, required you to preserve documents. but, at the time, no, that would not have been a crime. and if you could do it yourself, then asking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what congress really had in mind under section 1512. you know, hypothetical, the man could throw it out himself and not go to jail, but if he asked his wife to do it, then he goes to jail for ten years.
i think  i would disagree with you, justice breyer.
the westfall act makes an exception when you are making a constitutional claim. that is, in 1988 when the court passed the westfall act, there were two exceptions 2679b(2)(a) and (b) were constitutional claims and statutory claims.
then it is still wrong to take out 100,000 latinos using that assumption. i mean, the  the act that was done was to slice through the most latino county in the united states, 95 percent latino. the people were not removed anywhere else. clearly, the state removed latinos from this district and then said, well, we did it because we were aiming for democrats.
 you would say that the same situation would apply if the university faculty does not favor the particular war that the united states is 
what about the fact that it's under protest?
no, i said  i said they  in  the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination between the item, or items, the  in respect to  the purchase of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination existed. insofar as there were items, or items, purchased, there is no discrimination. at least there is no discrimination that  in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind of injury. in respect to instances where you have a strong case of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as i just defined it.
the solicitor general made that position clear before the argument  before this court in tesmer v. kowalski. so we have not been advancing that claim. in fact, we've been advancing a claim 
well, no. if we were a partnership, it couldn't be in an enterprise with  with an association of individuals. the question is 
yes, your honor, in my view it is.
what was the public disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?
 what they did.
yes.
if you're going to have a residue, hans is it i suppose.
one still 
well, if he is convicted and a civil action for damages is then brought 
respectfully, justice ginsburg, the evidence was precisely that he had been sweet and kind. over 90 percent of the evidence that defense counsel relied on in closing was the 15 character witnesses to show that he was a big lovable teddy bear and went to church, and was sweet and kind, and he had overcome these obstacles, and this was a momentary aberration. that was the central theme of defense's arguments. and in fact when the court 
 1-year time limit.
well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in federal court, there's not a constitutional error under chambers and related cases, is there?
you do have  one thing that seems concrete and clear to me  correct me if i get this wrong  michigan is kind of deferring to occ in its primary jurisdiction sense. it says customers, if you've got complaints about what this operating subsidiary is doing, you go first to the occ; and then if we think  we, michigan  thinks occ has not given you an adequate response to your complaint, we take over.
oh, there's no question there's a rube goldberg character of the whole thing, i  i realize. but  but that would be a way of  of solving the second habeas problem and still accepting the government's position on the  on the date at which the  the 1 year for filing starts.
then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you're from for the extension. get another month for the opposition, at least two months, month and a half, for us to dispose of it. it probably comes out to about six months.
i think 
we have the second lowest  smallest legislative districts in the country, 4,000 citizens per single-member legislative district. sure, that's what it costs to take out an ad in the free press, but there's nothing in the record to show that house candidates, legislative candidates, take out those size ads in  in the burlington free press. the record is otherwise. the record reflects that it's primarily door-to-door campaigning for legislative races. if you're taking out an ad, it's in  it's a flyer in one of the  the weekly papers. petitioner donald brunelle admitted that he ran a competitive race for the house, spending $1,000, that included yard signs, a mailing to his constituents, and flyer advertisements in  in the newspaper.
i don't think that williamson county ever contemplated that you would have to take your case all the way to the supreme court of the state. now, it may be that you had no choice once you got into the state court.
right.
it lists  it says "nothing in this statute is meant to alter the protections of," and then it lists a whole number of statutes, and those are all statutes that protect labor unions.
so you've really got three arguments. you've got the rule. you've got the statute, and you have due process.
doesn't  doesn't all that 18 bear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense? 19 isn't the reason that  that one considers these factors 20 mitigating is that they reduce the guilt at the time of 21 the offense? i  i thought that that's the whole 
and the same existed here, justice scalia. shell and texaco were  operated basically independently for at least 8 months, and certainly before they were major competitors. but look what happened here. all of the costs that were  all of the cost savings in this situation  there are  to show how  to show the anticompetitive effects of what happened, in this case, the crude oil was down to its lowest since the depression. the costs were being reduced under the so-called joint venture substantially. plus, there was excess supply.
if there had been a question certified to the colorado supreme court, and the colorado supreme court said we weren't intending to create any entitlement here, evidence that we don't even have a tort action that's willful or wanton conduct, no liability at all in the municipality. so suppose the state supreme court has said, we didn't mean to create any entitlement, then where would you be?
well, certainly in the civil-case context, generally, the interpretation has been pretty broad. and i suspect if we try to narrow it a lot, we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.
yes. the result would be the same. and i think you're asking me to put aside for the moment whether the fcc was correct in saying it was a covered practice.
we don't contend that the instruction was perfect here, but if one looks at the instruction as a whole and 
well, why isn't the motive irrelevant here? we don't want our facilities to be used for criminal activity.
so why isn't that, as justice breyer prefaced his question, an issue of preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of jurisdiction?
ms.  ms. woodman, you know, i  i have not, you know, gone along with  with most of our walton jurisprudence anyway, but  but what i have really always thought it demanded was really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be given the opportunity to grant mercy. i  i'm not sure i would describe any of it as any more precise than that.
but you are  what you are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, i don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence, and the trial court said, do you know what that means, and he said yes?
well, i think it would  it might depend on exactly what the statutory definition of "murder" in the state was.
mr. nager.
i think we would, your honor, to the extent that whren is about motives and this case is about something very closely related, still the inner working of an officer's mind, what legal conclusion he draws from facts.
i don't think they would do that, justice ginsburg. but there's a proposal that i'm aware of, already, to change the specific language of 2244(d)(2), and it was made by a congressman in california. it doesn't suggest changing it for california; it suggests changing the language. but that hasn't happened.
as i understand, the allegations are that there was random procedure in effect, and he thinks maybe he's been tested more frequently than some other people. that's all.
and it's a direction to 
you are  in that situation, you're waiting for the very first piece of equipment. in the tum case, you show up at the cage at the beginning of the day. you are engaged to wait. the regulatory citations are two: 790.6(b) and 790.7(h). there's also a case that's confronted this, which is the metzler case, 127 f.3d 959. all those authorities make clear that if the employer tells you, "show up to do something, show up here to put on your clothes," and, because of the way the employer has designed the system, you have to wait, through no fault of your own 
thank you, mr. garre. mr. jones.
he might conceivably have brought a due-process claim. and if he had brought a due-process claim, the court of appeals could have considered if that due-process claim met the substantive standards of the aedpa. he didn't bring a due-process claim. he brought a treaty claim. and that's the question upon which he sought certiorari review by this court.
well, but you're just hiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't in retaliation. your assertion still puts them in the position of having to defend a constitutional claim on a case-by-case basis every time there's a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior about, as in this case, what brady requires.
but it  but it is also a statutory fact, your honor.
not as it was applied. it came close in the sense that the district court was laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the guidelines held some control.
and is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to? i know there are cases that say you look to states but you only look to states where the state law is, in fact, consistent with the federal right.
they thought they had  it 9 was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that 10 this man might not even be competent at the moment to 11 stand trial, that he  that they might have a  a basis 12 for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to 13 rely just on what he told them without looking at the 14 record that was in the prosecutor's hands?
the question is, if i think the text is perfectly ambiguous on this, i look to the purpose, suppose i came out the way i just said. how would the government be hurt? is what i want to know.
but that goes to in navigation 
so, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year.
no, i think they mean what a district judge honoring his article iii commission concludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety of the complaint, looking for that strong inference, putting on his sort of motion to dismiss 12(b)(6) hat, says okay 
it seems to me how it reads. am i reading the law wrong? it says, shall not operate any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.
well, it's not that a right is waived. what it is 
and that most states do have such statutes. and we had this case because michigan chooses to go on  on a separate path.
and it's unreasonable to think congress would want the rights of those different federal employees to differ just because of where they live. and so what's the answer to that?
and it doesn't matter whether he knew those facts and circumstances.
well, what courts in  in your view have to make the retroactivity finding? the district court? the circuit where he's  which has jurisdiction over his case? any circuit?
if you're right on that, you're right on the ultimate question, too.
now let's take section 3.
why, why wouldn't it matter? i mean, other things being equal, suppose that he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles beyond the speed limit. and scott knew the whole thing or scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is a young kid who is frightened and he has his license number and he could get him later. i mean, why wouldn't it be nutty to  to try to bump somebody off the road, when all, that's all that's at stake?
but why is a categorical determination important? i threw you a  a bone a second ago, and i said maybe it's because of 
thank you, ms. mahoney. the case is submitted.
 let's hear your 
so you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of state law in  inasmuch as they apply to  to immunity.
no, i'm afraid i do not, your honor.
well 
but i think i'm violating.
we don't have anything like that here.
i'm making the distinction you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking about. now think of the second affidavit  when he reduces it to writing. that's different, calmer, clearly motive to testify, et cetera. fine. but now what mr. friedman pointed out is if we make it turn solely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp, et cetera, they'll just avoid that. so we're going to have to sweep into the second the circumstance where everything is the same but the formality, and that's where i have the difficulty.
we disagree.
well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but  but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court  they're all bollixed up with this foreign sovereign immunity act, so we're going to agree. you agreed that the case would go forward in delaware, the trial in delaware. is that not so?
well, in order to abrogate the state's sovereign immunity, there has to have been a valid exercise of congress's power, and there has to be a statute that represents a valid exercise of that power; otherwise, there's no basis for subjecting the states to liability. so, i don't think it's enough just to say, "maybe there  maybe there is an eighth amendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe, therefore, in this case, the state's sovereign immunity can be abrogated." it has to be done pursuant to a legitimate exercise of congress's power. reason number two, justice kennedy, is that, as in boerne and garrett, even where constitutional issues are implicated, title ii effectively imposes heightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject to rational-basis review under the constitution  for example, access to the law library, religious services, associational rights, those sorts of things. and that, i think, is the key distinction between this case and lane and hibbs. and so, as the court put it in garrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the statute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses that would be reasonable under the constitution, but would fall short of imposing an undue burden on the employer. number three, as in garrett, title ii prohibits standards and criteria that have a disparate impact on the disabled, even though that obviously wouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional violation if the disabled were a suspect class. and, again, the court need only look at the justice department's regulations to see how they impose a disparate-impact requirement. and, fourth, again, as in kimel and garrett, title ii reverses the burden of proof. as the court held in garrett, under the constitution, classifications based on disability are prima facie 
no, i don't think so. i think it is perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule, justice souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual place where you perform, not just any activities, and not just the activities that are integral and indispensable to your working activities, but to the principal activities for which you're hired  and, admittedly, there can be more than one of those, but that doesn't  you know, donning and doffing is not a principal activity 
to be sure, but that's the opinion. that's not the judgment. the judgment of the court of appeals is that this enforcement 
yes, but it would be the same rule if it was a bench trial. the judge could say to him  say, i think you may have enough but i'm not 100 percent sure yet. i'd like to hear the defense  hear the rest of the case. he doesn't  it does not really  the  the definition of a prima facie case does not depend on whether it's a jury trial or a bench trial.
well, the  the question of which standard applies i thought was before the court. was it correct for the florida supreme court to employ the cronic standard or should it have reviewed it under strickland? is that not before us? is that not 
but maybe in the prison setting, the lower courts would pay some attention to the court's recent decision in cutter against wilkinson, where the court made it very clear that a high level of deference  even dealing with a strict-scrutiny standard for religious freedom  that a high level of deference would be paid to prison administrators' judgment of what safety and discipline requires inside a prison. wouldn't that  wouldn't that carry over to the ada, were it to apply?
i  i don't think we've ever said that. i thought we've  we've said to the contrary, that the ultimate question is always, did the plaintiff show by a preponderance that  that the reason was discrimination. that's what i thought our  our cases say, not  not automatically to punish the employer for not giving a reason, he loses, which is what you want to do here.
i would have thought your answer would have been even if, even if the remand was improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the federal court. nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of review. i mean, we said in other cases that even when the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.
you also, i take it, have to have an equally limited approach on the recoupment analysis, then. i mean, your recoupment analysis would have to be symmetrical with your cost analysis.
so, there are 25-  so there are several thousand cases every year.
speaking of that case, can you give me any citation? and just give me a citation, and here there may not be one, but you give me a citation where texas previously said that a defendant who raised an objection before trial to the application of the statute to his client, he said it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give me one example in texas law where that was raised and the state appeals court of any  at any level said, i'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because you should have said it again during the trial.
as a whole, anywhere in it  give me language anywhere in the whole treaty that 
can you tell me  this is just basic bankruptcy. i should know, but i looked it up and couldn't find it. a standard promissory note which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the bankrupt  the maker of the note goes bankrupt. the holder of the note gets his attorney and says: file a claim in bankruptcy. and the attorney sends him a bill. is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?
i don't think it  it certainly doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. there are, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the disclosure of classified information, but i think that the 
yes, but you're 
because the broadrick facial challenge analysis that you engaged in in mcconnell is not completed because that includes future as-applied challenges. the government argues that there were 
a settlement does not deprive a federal court of subject-matter jurisdiction. that's the narrow point that is before this  before this court.
if the issue is jurisdictional, all the pendant state claims don't belong there and they've got to be chucked out; whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant claims are properly before the court.
well, it depends what can 
so the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?
and the wires would get worn, worn down, right? and the invention here is well, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move, and so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down.
i'm sorry, justice 
justice kennedy, i don't believe that's been applied in the tax code, but i can answer your question, i think, by saying this. congress on many instances has made provisions of the united states internal revenue code exclusive. congress knows how to write those provisions into the tax code when it wants to do so. in this case, it was not done. and i would also like to point out that after the decision in united states vs. williams, congress amended 7426 to add a special provision. and in that special provision, it was made exclusive. and i use that to exemplify the fact that congress can, when it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.
it's consistent with the rule not to enter an order that you're extending the time?
 care was.
that is precisely what robinson-patman is about.
we are talking about money, not property?
you are correct. but the ignoring here, the allegations are in the complaint, your honors, is that castle rock has this custom and policy, this pattern and practice of just ignoring these types of complaints. and the ignoring, as the law enforcement amicus brief filed on our behalf points out, the ignoring is a classic example of how police have traditionally responded to these types of complaints.
 i know it, but i've said, about three times, that i want to get beyond the peculiar position of california to any other empirical evidence that cuts for you or against you. and i take it there really isn't 
that's true.
thank you, mr. frederick. mr. hallward-driemeier.
and you rely on the statement in (a) that the  the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to  to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
you certainly may.
but the basic question i think is this. all of us  or almost all of us who are here  spent an entire summer reading through one of the longest set of opinions i've ever seen from the lower courts and going through a record that they had compiled over months reflecting 6 years of congressional effort. and what that record showed with dozens, hundreds i think, of examples was the basis for congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or isn't. and the only way that we have a hope of stopping rich people or corporations or labor unions from simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham ads is to have the rule that we had. now, you have a very good argument, but it's an argument that i heard right in that case. and we considered right in that case issues like yours, just ads like yours, ads that were even less sham-like than yours, if you want to call yours a sham  i don't mean to be pejorative. but we considered all that, and then we used them as an example. and of course, it was close. 5 to 4 this court said ads that are even more apparently neutral on their face than yours, congress can impose this requirement. now, what's different about your ad than the ads we put right in that opinion as examples of what we'd allow congress to control? what's different now or are you asking us to go back only a year later and undo what we did?
isn't it 
it has to be a primary purpose.
all right. so somebody has to say what price it's being sold at. equilon's gas. who decides it?
our position is that those are the two alternatives for where venue would lie for a conspiracy case.
and they made that decision under state law. they  they 
thank you, mr. marcus.
 it made. i  i mean, isn't it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a treaty, it may do so? now, if this rfra can trump a statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a treaty.
if he said $20 was going to be put towards the  the state instead of  instead of $100?
okay, but wait. who did the  who was the last person the state pointed its finger at? you  you told me in  in response to earlier questions that when the case back before the two remaining members of the panel, that in fact the state brought the  called to their attention the fact that wesley had confessed and  and it was  it was clear one way or another that  that they had argued in wesley's trial that he was the triggerman. when they  at that point when they are back before the two remaining members of the panel in stumpf's case, did the state say we now go back to our original position that stumpf was the triggerman and wesley wasn't, or did they say we think  we think wesley is the triggerman and stumpf wasn't? or did the state simply stand there agnostic?
under  under florida's scheme, yes, we have to wait because they have the complete discretion. we have no access to be able to get the public records. in fact, we've been denied throughout.
but the  the justice department has no authority to  to consent to suit which  which congress has not consented to. i don't see how this strengthens your case.
i read them, and i  i just perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but i just can't find the verification directly there.
 wouldn't be speaking in his capacity as a prosecutor, but that doesn't necessarily mean that his interests would be outweighed by the employer's interest. in 
and that would require a determination by a different tribunal that he was not a pow, in default of which he would be treated as a pow and be entitled to a court-martial? is that the point?
okay.
mr. chief justice, in  in response to that question, both potentially. in this case, again, there was no surface water connection, and due to the nature of the clay soils, it was found that there was no groundwater connection 
well, if we looked at garfield and cleveland, what would we find?
what about moore?
what are they? i see your white light is on.
well, but 
 because the time would fly. and so if they also represented him on the underlying plea and sentencing issues, then this person would not  then the underlying defendant would not be a person with standing to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have counsel.
if b could pass through the holmes wicket of causation, justice stevens 
it is a discharge, because a "discharge" means what?
no.
absolutely right. suppose you think in this federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. now, why? not just because of decorum. but because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury. and suppose i also think  i'm not saying i do, i'm trying this out  but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons. it is pretty hard to draw lines among banners. and the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole  is to have a wholesale rule on this. no buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters. how would you explain  you just say the law just doesn't permit that.
there were three named indigents.
i think it would have to be stronger than that, although i don't know how to translate that into percentages, justice stevens.
well, you may not  you may not rely on the distinction, but i would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, justice holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract.
when he bought the truck, he got the sale, although he earned less profit. put those to the side.
 at all.
i  i'm assuming that the court was being careful in its  in its choice of words, and i believe it was because that  that 
then what is the defense?
thank you, mr. grant. the case is submitted.
the answer is no.
 in drugs.
well, i  i think that 
no, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction. the statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers. it requires much more than that. it requires that they  it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer. so, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers. if you allow any other employer, you have to give it to the military in the same manner.
not in  not for  with regard to equilon because why they care, justice kennedy, is that  that they licensed these brand names to the joint ventures and they maintained control of the asset that they licensed, their name, because they operated in other markets where they weren't in competition with equilon and motiva. they did do business in other countries around the world, selling branded gasoline, unbranded gasoline, and other petroleum products. but as with any licensor, they care that the  that the goodwill that they're licensing is not impaired. so like any licensor, they put restrictions on the ability of  of the joint ventures to disparage those names or to undermine those names. but the decisions as to how to market and what to sell and at what price to sell was the single entity equilon in the western united states, and that's why it's not covered by section 1, much less subject to per se analysis.
aldinger dealt with a pendant party issue, yes, your honor. kenosha, however, dealt with  as the chief justice has indicated, kenosha dealt with a definition that excluded counties from section 1983 and that was found to be implicitly brought into the  the jurisdictional grant for civil rights actions. so i think the mere fact that something is or is not in the jurisdictional statute cannot be determinative because ultimately you do need to go back to the question of did congress want to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower federal courts. my question would be why would congress seek to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower federal courts for a whole category of cases where, in the words of this court in hishon, it has granted these businesses complete immunity from title vii?
can i ask you, where  one of the passages that i thought went a little far where is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to into your head; this is far more important than william weaver. this case goes far beyond william weaver. this touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world. that's the message you have to send. it just doesn't pertain to william weaver. it pertains to all of us, the community. the message  there are street, et cetera. okay. now. that struck me, as you argue this is rather extreme. its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from william weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons. now  to execute him. but where do i find in the u.s. reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make?
your honor, one of the pieces of evidence  and i would  out of 55 witnesses and 500 documents, was that there were certain people who were using too little cement. there was also evidence 
right. i think what you have to do, though, is go back and look at what michigan does. michigan has a  a state statute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carry property on an interstate basis in michigan, you must register with the psc and you must pay the required vehicle fees. the registration standards are what they do as in accordance with ssrs: insurance, service of process, and operating authority. then you have to pay a fee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle. in the case of michigan, those vehicle fees are set forth in two different sections of the statutes. one is .7(4), which is the $10 ssrs fee. the other one is subsection  it's 2(2). that fee is $100 
it comes with the money.
no 
some of the 
of course, if the  if the stuff was already there that supports the warrant and the search, we don't even reach the question of a  of the anticipatory warrant.
english is english. you said it was in the chair.
 to collect 
where does it say in the statute that they can't?
absolutely, your honor. because of petitioner's delay for more than a year and a half in a court that did not have jurisdiction, these bonds still have not been able to issue. and petitioner responded no. as a practical matter, the bond market will not support issuance of these bonds until attempts to undermine their validity have been brought to an end. and so the guam government has been doing different means of financing in a positive manner. the economy of guam has returned because of many of the devastating world events have taken, have passed in time, and the economy is recovering. the u.s. military is returning with a very large presence there. but they are still, my understanding, approximately two years behind in getting back tax returns.
all right. but what i'm getting at is let's assume he doesn't draw that inference. ultimately at step three, he says, no. i am going to reject the challenge. i do not think that the burden of persuasion has been met. what  what considerations might lead him to do that, assuming that step one has been satisfied?
all right. where is  where is 
isn't the definition of public welfare extremely broad?
that's correct. you file a 
but you 
it depends on whether the federal question has to be pleaded or not.
can you think of anything that's enacted by congress as jurisdictional?
i am asking. in analyzing the program, there are some things for it, and there are some things against it. and in trying to make that weighing, i do think it's different, because the basis of the program is commercial regulation. and so i want to be certain, in your view, that's either correct or incorrect.
but the 
if the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative, i assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative.
so you're saying you satisfy (e)(2)(a)(ii), because there's no lack of diligence. don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(b), which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty, in other words words subject to 
i'm hypothesizing that there hasn't been.
i'm sorry?
and that's why we came out the other way in smith, by the way.
is that because you never met a plaintiff you really liked? (laughter.)
one that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not raised by the state.
well, what i can say to that, justice breyer, is our opponents have repeatedly pointed out in their briefs deposition testimony that the parties refused to discuss price with each other before they had an actual memorandum of understanding out of concerns about the antitrust laws.
i would agree that would be a strange proposition because it suggests that they would ignore the merits of  of the proffered evidence itself. and i don't think that's what happened in this case, and i don't think that's what the south carolina supreme court 
is the level of potential risk the level that exists in extortion? right? that's what the otherwise refers you to.
isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm? supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd of people.
because this class of activities  because it's been isolated by the state of california, and is policed by the state of california, so that it's entirely separated from the market 
justice ginsburg, i'm not sure that i could the jurisprudence that said this court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the capitol can. now, if there was any difference drawn at all, i would assume it would be a difference based on history.
i mean, walking 
as an  as an empirical matter, i think that's right, justice ginsburg, but i'm not sure that that necessarily means that that's a legitimate expectation or a reasonable reliance interest of the type that the court would typically take into account in its retroactivity inquiry, because at the end of the day what it is, is a reliance interest that's predicated on essentially lack of prosecutorial resources, or a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion in some sense. and the court hasn't attached significance to that sort of reliance interest before. it's 
may i 
there might be criminal sanctions for willful  basically, in essence, it's sort of an idea of theft, you know, by not disclosing assets, but it's a relatively high bar for criminality. but that won't protect the creditors in the chapter 7 case.
so why shouldn't this operate as so many things do in  in an unfolding proceeding? if someone stands silent  and we're not involved with a fifth amendment privilege  there's an inference  an adverse inference. worse, take a  a discovery and one plaintiff asks for discovery from  from the  the defendant, and the defendant says, sorry, i'm not going to give you what you want. what is the consequence of that if the defendant, being presented with a opportunity or a requirement to give a reason or to produce something, says, i won't?
but the 
then i, then i don't think he is a very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he is entitled to violate blm rules or regulations. there is a certain amount of give and take that we think is inherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think that the just compensation clause tolerates. these are, the just compensation clause or property rights here are protected fundamentally by state law. that's why any unauthorized action by the government is a trespass, which is, which is dealt with under state law. the just compensation 
she did.
to put it this way, it seems to me the burden should be on you to  to tell us why a police  police officers are so stupid that they  that they go around and  and continue to give reasons when that's  when that's going to make it more difficult for them to sustain the arrest and subject them to  to personal liability.
because it says rate, and the 1980 psc regulations say that the relevant rate is tons per year. they use the word "rate" pervasively. i would also say the preamble to the rule makes conclusively clear that "major modification" is epa's definition of the statutory term. this idea that epa, it's completely inconsistent with not only 
thank you, counsel. mr. gilreath.
now i guess  my question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of limitation, is this an implicit additional, i realize it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.
 the petition has to be dismissed.
well, the content means a category of speech as opposed to what is the political position you're taking.
 black hole in the law 
whereas this just refers to a right and it includes statutory rights. and, of course, the odd thing about that is that normally when we construe a statute, we say it always meant that. it's not  it's not a new right in the sense as a right as of the date of enactment.
but defendant never took the position, "not me."
but isn't that almost a fourth point? i realize you didn't get the third point out yet. but isn't  i remember your brief and isn't there sort of a fourth point? and that is, i will assume that the government does have some basic health and safety objectives and the objective to protect its citizens here.
well, there's often a dissent. it's  it's hard to know from the standpoint of a researcher when  when it is that the judge who heard the evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting, unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because again, there's no original opinion issued by the tax court judge who first heard the case. that's kept confidential by statute, which again is an important point. congress has mandated confidentiality of the initial reports prepared even by tax court judges, and it has given the tax court plenary authority to promulgate rules governing special trial judges. it is hardly surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or due process clause, for the tax court to follow a similar process for special trial judges.
thank you, mr. waxman. mr. olson, you have, let's see, four minutes.
would you agree, though, that, if you had a separate sentencing jury, one that did not have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that at the guilt phase a determination has been  that has  it has been found that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the scales in favor of imposing the death penalty?
a likelihood  
they spent about ten pages in the appendix trying to do that.
does he get what i just said?
well, justice scalia, i think it's a risk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial testing. it is the possibility that it could have an impact.
do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers? judge dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term. the special trial judge is appointed by the tax court and his job is at the tax court's grace. and if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, i think it's worlds different.
but i don't  i don't  excuse me. i don't understand how that makes any sense. if you had an  a  a case that's litigated entirely on state law grounds and in the state supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua sponte deciding this on the basis of the federal constitution and you, state, lose, your argument is that state is just out of luck. they can't seek review of that decision?
 vehicles, as was done here, so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on land.
that's right.
obviously, you're right, justice kennedy, but obviously, there are concerns that are implicated when somebody is running in cycle and the ad has targeted the electorate in the immediate run-up to the election that aren't present there with senator kohl and, therefore, the congress has  has struck a different balance in that case. but just to focus on the timing of these ads, they were run on day 4 of a 45-day august recess of the senate. now, that timing, if what you were trying to do, is to influence a pending legislative vote, is very, very odd timing. it could hardly be worse. if, on the other hand, you're trying to influence the upcoming election, the timing of that ad makes a great deal of sense.
no?
you're going to say yes. so all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether  the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.
i mean  i mean, it's  it's that they honestly believed that wesley  that in the wesley trial, that eastman testified truthfully. they believed that.
to decide this case?
well, it  it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained 
that's the nsps section. then you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the psd regulatory definition, and it comes right back to emission rate, or the regulatory history that says the emission rate as used in this provides is identical 
did  are  just as an initial matter, are you sure that one congress can bind a future congress that way, that congress can pass a law that says, you know, "in the future, no statute shall have x effect unless it says"  and then it writes in a phrase that has to be said?
if you want us to say that 
and you also acknowledge we're not here to try to make sense.
 prevent it. i'm not sure that it is necessarily desirable for jurors to do that. and there is some suggestion, in the empirical evidence, that what actually goes on in the jury room is that jurors with some level of doubt about a defendant's guilt will actually negotiate with other jurors to ensure that a defendant is convicted, but ends up not being sentenced to death.
well, i don't think 
and what i want to know is what's your rule.
could  could i get one fact? wesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed. he  he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?
why, why, why do you say there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter? i would have thought every case it mattered. look, isn't it an absolute rule that there's a federal issue in a case and there's a state ground, the state ground typically is a failure to raise an objection, and a state court says the federal ground is what we're talking about. they say nothing about the state ground and they decide the federal ground. the defendant goes to a federal court and he says, i'm entitled to be released because they got the federal ground wrong. i thought it's a hundred percent the case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's now too late for the state to raise the state ground but the state's waived their adequate and independent state ground and that if they try to raise it again the answer is always, not some of the time: i'm very sorry, state; you're out of luck; you should have decided it on the state ground and not reached the federal ground.
the respect of other countries for our country is something we should totally ignore.
the house report 
if pickering balancing is done, is there anything special about the situation where the employee's speech is part of the employee's job duties? is the test applied differently in that situation?
the vast 
privilege.
there  there's an appeal from  they could request certiorari from the state supreme court to this court, i assume.
and what's the difference between that and a police report that makes it quite clear that in the circumstances there was no possibility of a boat or a car being involved? what's the difference between that and the police report?
the record is unclear as to that. there are certainly many indications in the popular press that cecil b. demille together with his movie, the ten commandments, worked with the friends of eagles to have these monuments put around the country. but there is nothing in the legislative history that links this particular monument to that.
justice scalia  justice alito, if this were a final  if this were like a criminal proceeding, we wouldn't be here. the whole point of this is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal itself. this isn't a challenge to some decision that a court makes. this is a challenge to the court itself. and that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal context that you're positing. the ordinary criminal context you're positing  and i'm thinking of a case like schlesinger versus councilman, a court-martial case  what the court has said is that it's the  the predicate for abstention is the idea that congress has fairly balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, and has  and has made certain determinations. here, none of that has happened. it's all been made by the executive. and the difference is crucial in military justice, because, as justice kennedy said for the court in loving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military tribunals. and the thing that makes it different than the ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this court said, stops military justice from being lawless is the congress of the united states setting clear limits on the use of military justice. now, if those limits had been observed, if this court  if the military commission complied with the rules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here. our whole point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the well-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial cases. in addition, we believe that to further  to further on  justice alito, on your point  this court has already said in the military commission context that a different rule applies. in quirin, this court rushed in to hear a military-commission challenge before the commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it said that the public interest required adjudication of these issues. and the public interest is no less severe in that case than it is here. that is, this is a military commission that is literally unbounded by the laws, constitution, and treaties of the united states. and if you adopt the government's position here, it effectively replicates the blank check that this court rejected in hamdi.
but, mr. kneedler, i understand your argument to be they should be treated just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no distinction between a constitutional basis and a common  and just that he hated his brother-in-law. i think you're saying they're the same. that's what i understand justice scalia to be asking you.
your honor, in the barnett case and in the atherton case, in order to have the kind of problem you're talking about, there must be a significant interference with the business of banking or an incapacitation of the business of banking. our michigan law doesn't incapacitate what 
the injunction just speaks for itself. it doesn't say what  doing what you used to do or anything like that.
what am i  you said factually. what am i supposed to assume? you said in light of  i mean, i looked at the tape and that tape shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving around automobiles that are coming in the opposite direction with their lights on, goes through a red light where there are several cars that are right there, weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other way, weaves back, goes down the road. now, what in fact  am i supposed to pretend i haven't seen that? what am i supposed to pretend to here?
and we  we would  and again, if this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be  it would be fine. but the fact is as in scheiner, the out-of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is  is operating 
if the firearm  if looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, he may not have been entitled under the  the factual prong that  that the washington courts use on lesser and greater offenses.
how do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness, if any?
obviously, i wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute.
well no. accept, accept my premises. what do you think i should do?
it's a new hampshire rule. (laughter.)
in 
if we descend from the level of parsing the  the statute to what's going on in these cases, in your cases i take it there was an injury to a child.
suppose, on the commerce-clause question, i  on assumption, i don't agree with you, either  then do i have to decide? [laughter.]
yes.
thank you, counsel. ms. underwood?
every  every newly recognized is an  is an initially recognized, although every initially recognized is not necessarily a newly recognized. is that it?
well, that's true. i mean, we can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's a transaction or occurrence, i assume. and is it open to us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?
sort of at the second stage, again she spoke of youthfulness. then at a third stage, she said, well, it's a combination of  of age, gender, and inexperience. then she realized she was in trouble, and she said, well, i really didn't mean gender because i  i'd be in constitutional hot water there. then she said, well, i really don't mean age because there are other young people on the jury, and i'm  i'm not challenging them. so that the only thing that was left was possibly that element of age which refers to ties to the community. and at the end of this long colloquy, in which she has gone back and forth and back and forth and  and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial judge says, well, i didn't see the eye-rolling, and i guess i'll give the benefit of the doubt to counsel. i don't know whether the judge is talking about the benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of the doubt on  on ties to the community. assuming it's ties to the community, that has nothing to do, i suppose, with  with the  the fear that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a defendant who's up for the third time with a small amount of drugs. and at the end of the day, it seems to me we have what justice kennedy's question in the first place suggested. we simply have an incoherent colloquy and a response to the judge which simply does not tell you what the judge is ruling on or the basis for the ruling. all we know is that ultimately he's saying i'm rejecting the batson challenge. that's the problem with  with deference in this case. what  what is your response to that?
and you say he was not 4 diligent in challenging those convictions.
it doesn't lie damages here. can you get damages under 1983?
well, it was incomplete, your honor, because i  i had turned around to answer the chief justice. the  the way they have this set up with the right of reimbursement and the  and the kickers that blue cross blue shield puts in the statement of benefits creates a situation. they  they add that these rights of reimbursement apply no matter how the cause of action for damages is delineated, in other words, whether it's seeking damages for medical benefits or damages for pain and suffering. and what blue cross blue shield has introduced is that  that kicker. and  and what that does, in effect, from state to state is change the outcome for the employee because, for instance, in new york where we have a collateral source rule by statute that says, you may not prove medical damages in a personal injury case for which you've collected insurance. so, for instance, in denise mcveigh's case, i can't prove her medical bills. yet, blue cross blue shield is going to come in and pick denise finn's pocket on her claim for pain and suffering for the $157,000 in medical bills that they say they've paid. whereas, if i go across the river  and i don't know the law in new jersey, but assuming that new jersey uses the older rule where, if i had the good sense to buy myself medical insurance and i collected medical insurance for the benefits that were  if i collect the medical payments for the medical bills, i can still go into court and prove those medical bills as against the tortfeasor. in that particular instance, blue cross blue shield comes in and it takes money at least that i've gotten from the other side as opposed to in new york where they take money that i haven't gotten from the other side.
competing harm.
it could arguably be a felony murder, which is a separate statute in mississippi.
well, with all due respect, mr. chief justice, if mr. guzek does not intend to rely upon the eighth amendment, i think that this would moot the case and that the  this court could then vacate that portion of the oregon supreme court's opinion.
that's important. they say they want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in relation to its proposed therapeutic indication. the reason, i take it, the word "efficacy" is not there directly is because that word has a history, the kefauver hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do anything. safety is a different matter. but of course when you consider whether something is safe, you must know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its effect in curing people. so how could you possibly, particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that are  that are harmful? if i knew that there was any answer to that question at all, i might be tempted to agree with you, because it doesn't use the word. but what's the answer?
but in  in respect to glacier bay 
no.
 your position is. i just want to know what your position is.
 with respect to the out-of-state distribution 
i mean, you'd deterred him more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do that.
yes.
i know, but would you  would you expect to come to the same result or not?
 coach  coach jackson would have sought, and  and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case  if you're down in birmingham, alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is  and it's the reason 
could you just back up just for a second? supposing at the time of the bankruptcy that the services have not been performed. it's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.
well, isn't there 
yes, your honor. this constitutional violation was not harmless for a number of reasons. for one, character was the key consideration in the jury's analysis of whether this person should live or die. the court is saying that even 7 years after this crime occurred, that carman deck is so dangerous that he needs to be in both belly chain and legirons to keep the courtroom safe, to keep him there. the court is saying that he's dangerous in the courtroom, that he remains dangerous and therefore he 
that's correct. if the officer terminates the chase then he is never going to be liable because number one he is acting prudently; he is going based upon department of justice studies showing 70 percent 
thank you, counsel. general sorrell.
well, if  if that's so, then maybe mr. chemerinsky is right. we  we shouldn't have injunctions. if you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.
the bankruptcy court could certainly do that. the procedural safeguards of due process require, obviously, notice and hearing of the court's reasons for wanting to say that.
you  you want us to adopt a 9 constitutional rule that at least in pennsylvania counsel 10 have to consult these  these records 
okay. but so far as the fourth circuit  tell me if i'm wrong here  it sounds to me that the fourth circuit took the following position, that for purposes of determining diversity, it is not enough to name a principal who may be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without naming the subsidiary, or, if you name a  i'm mixing up principal and corporation 
this didn't make a whole lot of sense.
the judge was bound by those.
but under the old rule that plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar to recovery?
oh, but you don't mean that, because you're prepared to concede  at least i thought you were, until your last argument  you're prepared to concede that if a person engages in a crime that is punishable as a felony under south dakota law, and it is also punishable as a felony under federal law, under 801, et seq, well, that counts.
well, it was there first, but you can argue in the defense alternative, i think nothing happened. but if the plaintiff can convince a jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince him of is within the scope of his employment. now did that happen in the district court, that they said something like that or not?
absolutely, justice souter. what  what the text of the statute says 
no, no, i say that there are a number of  what i'm thinking of is a lot of interim decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is placed  whether in class, whether in that class, whether with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether not. i mean, they're  these are very complicated matters, and there can be important overall matters, and there can be what i'd call interstitial matters.
oh, i see.
yes. i  i thought  i thought the district court said i'm going to deny the motion to certify because the issue is clear in my view, but if you think you have a collateral order doctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal.
mr. hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, i was very curious why the government is defending this practice because the government, after all, is on the other side of every case. and aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the government's favor and then the government loses the case before the tax court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were? i mean, i  i  the government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge  special trial judge was?
it would be permissible because the  if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the registration process, in order to be qualified to engage in interstate trucking. the $90 would be charged to the owner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned basis under irp.
in newspapers and also the criminal investigation, but i think what's important is that the standard that rockwell seeks to have this court adopt would actually require such a great level of specificity that is not in the public disclosure at all. and i think, justice stevens, you asked that precise question. the public disclosure was very general. and the tenth circuit 
so you're  you're basically arguing he was not a credible witness.
your answer is no, i gather.
sure.
it's strange to talk of reducing  is  is not required to reduce funding for a new program. i mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. how can you reduce the funding for a new program?
well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work.
in my opinion, the better policy, the better practice, is that there should not be. now 
yes.
i  i think we alleged that in terms of the ability of mr. mcdonald to perform on the contract, even though it was 
and that sounds like a factual question that ought to be developed.
mr. dreeben, this touches on what troubles me about this. i wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented, whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error, without considering the nature of the alleged defect here. i don't know how you can answer  if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place.
no. he drives.
and is that the law here?
no, but the 
i'll have to confess i don't  it does say something like every person shall have the same right as  dot, dot, dot, as white persons. but so the  the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point i'm trying to make is that even if that's true for  for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as justice kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a spending clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the birmingham board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. if you can imagine 
yes, your honor.
your honor, i would submit that it is  it is more  it is much greater than 4. but whether it represents something that is unexpected by the inmate, in reality the inmate has an expectation of having his liberty essentially extremely limited in this instance 
that's 
but that's a different provision. i'm now thinking of the "normal case," where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the sentencing phase, and it says here, under oregon law, "judge, tell the jury that everything they previously heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes of what sentence they should impose." i just wonder what that sentence is doing there in oregon law, unless the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's really  "i'm completely certain he's guilty."
there's  there's specific knowledge.
the object code has several jobs. one job when embodied on the golden disk is tell a  is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to put a message on a hard drive. another job that the object code has is when the object code gets on the resulting disk or the hard drive. but in fact, the manifestation of the object code on the golden disk and the manifestation of the object code on the resulting disk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable from what is constructed.
you're right.
taylor said you don't look at facts 
there's no supervision of people outside the united states, mr. chief justice, but he is still subject to the jurisdiction of the district court, and still subject to the conditions of supervised release that are not dependent upon supervision.
i believe the particularity requirement also does not assume that the officers seeking the warrant will be the officers serving the warrant.
justice souter, i  i do want to reserve the remainder of my time, but the point is that a defendant who has his second-choice opportunity of counsel is able to express his autonomy interests in a much more significant way than a defendant who is denied the right to self-representation.
wait. what happens in that situation?
well, the way  the way i would view it is that the damage remedy is disproportionate to congress's legitimate goals in this case, for a couple of reasons. number one, as in  as in florida prepaid and some of this  some of this court's other decisions, the abrogation of sovereign immunity is not limited to the specific areas that congress and the courts have identified as the greatest concern, from a constitutional standpoint. and, number two, the abrogation of sovereign immunity is not limited to the states, or categories of states, where there has been a finding of unconstitutional action. so, we do think that that would be a sufficient basis to invalidate this statute's abrogation of sovereign immunity, but we also think that the statute is not at all congruent with the requirements of the constitution. and, as 
that's right, your honor.
correct.
but state courts are perfectly capable of  of applying and we assume that they would apply and adhere to constitutional law from this court.
well, i think it  it did adopt the rule, though, as a basis of the wording. and if you look at page 733 of the court's opinion, it was adopting the rationale, in the sense that it saw birnbaum as a construction of the language, and it adopted that. and then in note 5, when justice rehnquist's opinion says, "it would be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale' to give a," quote, "'cause of action to everybody in the world,'" i think it's clear that that was suggesting that state law could recognize something that this court said was not recognized under federal law.
can i, again, make sure i have the hypothetical in terms  we are, in a sense, talking about the first wait. you show up at the first 
 because we  we will say  in every single time, following your argument, you will  we will say the  the violation had nothing to do with the authorization to seize the evidence. the violation simply had to do with the  with the  the niceties and the risks involved in entering. so if we accept your argument, no-knock is  is a dead duck, isn't it?
excuse me, justice scalia.
well, you're not urging that the constitution requires the officer on the spot to state the cause of the arrest, or are you?
what about a policeman who smells marijuana coming out of a car or a residence. he's walking down the street, public street, and he smells marijuana.
 so, in this  or, weren't there previous california cases  or, again, correct me if i'm wrong  where california says the reasonable-possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial? i thought that was the california law. or am i wrong?
mr. chief justice, the government has argued successfully in this court that we don't make any assumptions about whether people will consent or not. there are innumerable cases in the lower courts 
it is certainly official true that the district court 
no?
he has tried way more of them than i have as well, and i can't speak to that specifically. it's not an argument that was ever made in the briefs. but again, i have no reason to believe that the federal district court can't take account of whatever it needs to take account of in order to avoid 
oh, yes.
mr.  mr. becker, if there is room for the agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the fair labor standards act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the agency is subject to the fair labor standards act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. so why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?
 the type of argument?
that's how this statute was interpreted by the kansas supreme court.
but you  but so would the word "transmission" if you  under your reading, you don't need the word "miscarriage."
 of 
even though 
 scienter requirements for  and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the requirements of the pslra. none of those could be brought in federal court, because they're barred by the various provisions of federal law.
 and i don't see anything contrary to that.
it seems to me anybody you sue is a real party.
thank you, counsel. mr. kneedler.
 "administrative procedures aren't all that  they're cracked up to be. there's a good reason to avoid them." i 
no, no. i don't want to give you a win 
well, there is a distinction that's made in terms of fourth amendment protections that are given to homes and people versus cars. ever since the carroll case, it has been recognized that a warrantless search of a car can be done if they found probable cause.
yeah. and i think the reason that that exists is because, up til today  and mr. moran's correct, most courts go the other way  up until the stevens case, the assumption had been  and i think the assumption has come from miller and sabbath  the assumption has been, if there's a knock-and-announce violation, you exclude the evidence. so, questions of causation have not been explored until the stevens case, and then the seventh circuit, in several opinions, has also reached the same conclusion. but i think sabbath and miller present very different circumstances. sabbath and miller, as the court will recall, were arrest cases. and the arrest situation does not translate into the execution of a search warrant, because knock-and-announce serves a different purpose, an additional purpose, in the arrest situation, that is not served when  in the search situation.
is it your position that we owe deference to the interpretation of the sec?
but then  but you were  you are including at least wetlands that abut 
counsel, i don't  i don't see how the interference with the probate court that you're articulating is any greater than the interference in markham. in markham, it was a decision by a federal court that these claimants were not going to claim under the will. why is  isn't that even greater than the interference you're complaining of?
 a case in which it would be constitutionally protected. but you're saying if he says it publicly  assuming we pass the balancing test  that if he said the same thing to his boss directly internally, no protection.
i think it's a question of degree and while over time the importance of the purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully diminish and the effect does not change substantially. it is a question of degree, it is a question of line drawing. here there is not an effort to incorporate the ten commandments into a neutral display or a neutral course of study such as a compare and contrast of ancient moral codes or a comparative religion course such as many of us have taken and schools clearly can offer. it is not a neutral display of law givers like the frieze in this court. it asserts the primacy of the ten commandments. it says the ten commandments are the moral background of the declaration of independence. it doesn't say there is some commonality between the ten commandments and some american laws. it talks not only about law. it talks about our system of government. it says the ten commandments, the revealed word of god is the moral foundation of the declaration of independence. that in itself is an endorsement of religion in this context and i don't think that can dissipate over time.
i thought you told us earlier it wouldn't survive turner. i  i don't understand your argument.
mr. shapiro, you have about 4 minutes left.
that's a 
how do you describe dealing with a case like manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?
getting back to your question, maybe this answers part of it: although the court  you asked, justice scalia, you asked a question about why can't we make this basically maybe a fact-based inquiry. and if you were to do so, the whole categorical approach that we're dealing with in all the other sections would almost become irrelevant because if something doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to a fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole official purpose of the categorical approach.
do you think  do you think, do you think i should do this? i'm still looking, i'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding. i'm worried about that, as are you.
right.
no, they won't, and they haven't. if the employee  employer has a concern about the manner in which it's communicated, that is a valid employment concern. i mean, suppose ceballos had gone a had a big meeting with 
 step of the analysis.
the language  the language is on your side, i think there's no doubt. but it's not unambiguous. imagine a prison rule that says that the  after the prison board, the  the prisoner has 2 weeks to appeal to the warden from the time of the decision of the board if the prisoner has been notified. the prisoner isn't notified for 3 weeks. i think we'd read that to say he has 2 weeks from the time of notification. you  you can use can if in that way. it's not impossible. and once i begin to think it could be open, i think, well, let's look for the most practical approach.
is that what you're saying?
thank you, general. mr. drozdowski, we'll hear now from you.
the reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the eighth circuit has stated in  in the huebner case, it  it said that it's a minimal penalty. however, there is still the unfettered access that's available.
all right, well 
 the court.
that's absolutely right. in that case, where the court did refer an antitrust issue, the agency declined to take the reference. and here there there was a factual issue the agency was supposed to opine on. here we have a pure legal question, the court has held, of potential repugnance with the sec scheme. that's for the court to decide.
it can, your honor, at that point.
oh, no. they  they do modify and reject. it's just it's hard to determine, when they are doing that. in the old days 
you said that? you said that, "and we have a  we have asserted all the elements of good samaritan"?
i was  i was simply trying to point out  the  the court had asked how long are inmates generally in the long term segregation unit, and  and the point that i made is that it's not unusual for inmates to remain on level 2 for periods in excess of 1 year.
your honor, it's no more of an exception than brady, which is exactly the same situation where you have a right that you don't know either the violation has occurred, because they didn't tell him and his lawyer didn't tell him, and you don't know the evidence that could have been developed. here, once that  once that missing piece, that one critical part of article 36, direct notification and contact with the consulate, once that key is removed, everything else follows.
they  they argued generally in  in the record, and it was  it was somewhat cryptic. they argued that it was unfair 
well, doesn't that make it a contract case? if you're talking about the party who's contracted with, say, a private inspector  i mean, i have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house for termites, and i assume, if they don't do a good job and the house is damaged, they're liable. but that's under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.
can i ask about that? i found persuasive solicitor general garre's point that in the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain. is there anything wrong with that response? it seems to me 
i was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoner's option to say i don't want the whole case dismissed. i will amend my petition so that the court will have, will retain the exhausted claims. you are saying not like habeas, i don't want it to be like habeas, because if it were like habeas, the prisoner would have the option to stay in the federal court as long as he lopped off the unexhausted claims. you don't want it. you don't want it to be like habeas?
as  well, my  i leave that to other people. (laughter.)
i'm sorry, you'll just have to bear with me.
well, suppose that happened, and then the court of appeals said the united states should have been substituted?
justice o'connor, we  we would like to move on to  to some of the other evidence because it  it is substantial. and we've set  we've set out a lot of that evidence beginning at page 6 of our reply brief.
correct.
well, sometimes you have to let them get away. in garner, it says, even if the guy has just broken into somebody's house in the middle of the night and committed a felony, if the choice is letting them go or using deadly force when the factors authorizing deadly force are not present, you have to let him go.
what if the court of appeals does that? what if the court of appeals says we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of them do not take military service into account, one does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the interest in uniformity. and so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion i'm going to depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?
there are a variety of taxing schemes all across the world. the question that the united states has to make when it determines whether to prosecute a wire fraud scheme is whether it's in interest  in the interest 
well, i mean i don't think it should figure in this court's decision. i mean principally because the other side in neither case makes a challenge based on the commerce clause, and i suppose there is two reasons for that. that legal reason that they don't bring the challenge is because there is a jurisdictional element that i think would address the challenges as a doctrinal matter. the practical reason i think is because this isn't the only instance in which the federal government has gotten involved to address issues related to the abortion context.
but it's so odd.
and is the obligation enforceable in state court?
$750,000, your honor. and  and i would suggest that we never had an opportunity to introduce any facts. it 
oh, i realize that, but it seems to me your basic argument, if i understand it, is there is simply no search here, and because there is no search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with a house or a parking lot or a car on the road. no search is no search. so for purposes of  if i  i want to understand your case, and as i understand it, for purposes of your case, there is no significance in the house because there doesn't have to be. the question doesn't arise because there's no search. is that 
no. they're panels of three. they issue about 4,000 opinions each year. so each judge is responsible for authoring 
well, when does  when does it occur? i mean, if  if  first you say the  the house is  is a matter of significance for kyllo analysis. we're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one, between kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the house. they can sniff the foundations. they can go to the front door, et cetera. i don't see that the house, in fact, is functioning as a distinction at all.
if  if we find or if there is a finding that the  that the attempted shuffle on this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case, even though the shuffle didn't take place?
it hasn't decreed otherwise. congress essentially 
but that's just a conclusion of law, justice ginsburg. so the  the facts that you know are the facts as they're described 
no, sir.
i  i wrote boyle and what i thought i was saying was that the common  (laughter.)
no, no, no. it's  it's both. with respect to defective design, what we said is, your claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the jury on defective design without impeaching the label. if we're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment submission.
some affirmative order of the court not only saying we're going to extend the  the time, but to give an alternative time. that  subsection (b) does not allow for  for an indefinite withholding of a mandate.
respondents don't concede that the joint venture is lawful, though.
okay. the flip side of that, if i can  the  the title of section 2244 is finality of determination. if you are seeking to upset a final determination, you are governed by 2244 not 60(b). if you are not seeking to upset a final determination, let me give you the two  the two circumstances that come to mind right away. one is the fraud exception recognized by the court of appeals, and there could be similar errors like that  and this is what we talk about in our brief  that essentially vitiate the existence of a determination in the first place. they are that profound and that rudimentary. then you are not upsetting what our system recognizes to be a determination and what congress wanted you to have. the other exception is essentially 60(a), clerical  you're not  errors. you're not really upsetting anything. you're actually trying to implement or effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals. the only gap  i'm not sure it's a gap at all after the argument here  is that we don't limit it to fraud. we recognize that there are some other foundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that conceivably could occur. i'm not aware of them happening, but something like a biased judge addressed by this court in toomey v. ohio.
the texaco product being a product that comes out of refineries that previously belonged to texaco or the texaco product being gasoline that comes out of either refinery but is sold to stations labeled texaco, or both? which?
 that's not  that's not the hypothetical. so, suppose that a supervising district attorney tells the deputy district attorney, "go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or conceal evidence," or whatever 
i will concede it was, i will concede it was a difficult case.
but i think you have to tie the causal connection to the purposes  as i have tried to indicated  to the purpose, or purposes, served by the principle violated. what is the purpose of knocking and announcing? and i think  your honor indicated  it's to protect against injury to the police, injury of people inside, and property. it has no purpose to protect against the invasion of the privacy of the dwelling and the discovery of the evidence. in fact, if the police knew in advance that the defendant might flush the drugs down the toilet, they wouldn't have to knock and announce at all. so, i think we have to relate the causal question to, what is the principle violated? what purposes does it serve? and, in the case of knock-and-announce, it does not serve the purpose of allowing evidence to be destroyed. that, in fact, serves as an exception to knocking and announcing at all.
does that apply to all the provisions of the organic act? i mean, there are provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue that we are considering here as well. do we defer to the guam supreme court's view on that?
well, rule 50(a) doesn't literally say that the motion can be denied. it simply says that it can be granted. but i think we have to infer from that, that it can be denied. and i would equally infer that a lesser remedy is possible once the 50(a) motion is made. but i don't think it's possible to read the rule as saying that the only way these remedies are available is through a 50(b) motion, because that's inconsistent with the provision that the motion can be granted under 50(a). the  it, further, seems to me that if the  if the motion is  if decision on the motion is deemed to be had  to have been deferred, then that motion is still before the court, even if the court has denied it. and the court can grant it later on 
but, you know, when you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens imposed by the federal government. it eases burdens imposed by state governments.
are you saying that congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.
your honor, that's not before, and if there were other reasons 
well, if 
absolutely. but i think, your honor  because i think it would be impossible to satisfy it under this instruction. in addition, i also think that the  that this provision really just demonstrates that the government's interpretation of "corruptly" is wrong, to begin with.
justice stevens, it would be only in the context of that one particular application as applied to that physician, which would have stare decisis 
well, certainly the district courts would do that. the more appropriate course of action would probably be to find the motion at that point untimely because it does not fall within any of the  it  if it is outside the initial year from finality but doesn't fall within any of the other exceptions stated in paragraph 6, then it  it would be untimely and the court could dismiss it as such. i mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it, it could well count as a first motion so that any motion filed thereafter would be a second or successive motion. and this would be  preclude litigants from filing prematurely and burdening the courts with premature filings until it is clear they have a cause of action. i mean, what's strange about the government's reading of the statute is that they believe congress intended for a limitations period to begin to run before the litigant had any right to relief. no one has a right to relief in the collateral proceeding until the right at issue has been made retroactively applicable to collateral cases. and so that this kind of disjoinder of the statute of limitations and the cause of action creates this problem where people will be  feel compelled to file protective motions.
our  our test for significant nexus would start with the  the basis that there must be an established, existing hydrological connection between the wetland and the body of water adjacent 
yes.
all right. thousands.
yeah, that's correct. but that's from the docket 
there was jurisdiction, your honor. our position is the same in both of those cases. and indeed if that issue of jurisdiction had been litigated in this case, petitioner could have brought a writ to the ninth circuit judgment and litigated jurisdiction in this case. but if the courts ultimately determined that there was not jurisdiction, it had 
 in 
that doesn't affect 
what if, what if the ninth circuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction? would it be the same?
i'm not 
 be a restriction.
that was not the basis on which the judge rejected it. he didn't reject it on the basis 
yes, your honor. two responses. first, the procedures that we submitted in our supplemental brief that were approved by the new hampshire supreme court made quite clear that there is no procedure for getting the judge on the phone. and in addition, any delay 
has it happened to you before?
yes, your honor.
conceivably, if it's too short, it's not reasonably available. i guess 
no. but in taylor and in seidler this court used the model penal code as a shorthand for the generic definition of a certain crime. but we don't rely on the model penal code.
may i ask this question. supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order had been entered on february 10 or february 12. say his handwriting was illegible. would that be a dispute that would remain open throughout the appellate process?
that's right. and that's what the attorney general did here, certified that mr. haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose. and as several 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
leaving aside the conflict of interest that the lawyer would suffer on two additional reasons why the  why the lawyer is not 
i'm sorry. i apologize. the  the defense counsel.
justice scalia, i'm happy to do that.
i would be happy to  to, in a different case, make the argument that although richards says a court cannot say that knock and announce is forgiven every time a drug warrant is executed on the theory that experience teaches that drugs and guns go together. i'd be happy to argue that that holding does not apply when a judge determines, in issuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together, so i'm putting it in the warrant. i'd be happy to argue that case. at this time 
as a result of his reentry five  within 5 years of the date of his 1981 deportation, he would be ineligible for readmission for 5 years, had he left the country.
unusual. i 
which  but it's a perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion that our political power enables us to  to provide for. legislatures redraw the maps all the time for political reasons. i mean, to say that this is, you know, something horrible is ridiculous. you acknowledge that political motivation is fine.
 that was, therefore, preempted.
of guilt, but not necessarily of the  but if the evidence of deliberation occurred at other events in the chain of events, than the alibi is relevant to the sentencing question the jury must decide. it's also relevant to  perhaps, to provocation. so, there are factual determinations that the sentencing jury has to make.
all right. i'm on 23. what are we 
well, why would it be  i mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not have been likely to make a difference with the jury, and therefore it could have been excluded in the first instance.
you don't believe in harmonization, mr. olson? [laughter.]
i mean, have you gone back to square one? and it's just, there's no diversity at all? or is there substantially more diversity? can you tell us about that? because it's important. it may mean that you don't need to identify students by the color of their skin in assignment.
your honor, we're not aware of any cases in which the u.s. attorney general has ever attempted to de-register or to prosecute a doctor who was acting in accordance with state law. we have a history that we're  to  at least since the controlled substances act, in 1970, where the u.s. attorney general has never attempted to suggest, as he does here, that something that is permissible under state law is, in any sense, a violation 
but does the givhan case fall within that?
i see. so you're  you're not conceding that  that hydrologic  hydrological connection is adequate. you're just  is sufficient. you're just saying it's necessary.
well, it could enforce the injunction.
it's only after  one would expect in a merit system that there would be some level of variation in the area and that would work out over time. it's only when it doesn't, when the disparity persists, when the different treatment accrues again and again and the overall disparity in the wages increases, that the employee has some reasonable basis to think that it's not natural variation in the pay decisions but actually intentional discrimination. in the paycheck accrual rule that's been applied by the lower courts for more than 20 years without incident, adequately balances the interest of employees and being able to come forward once they find out that there is a reason to suspect discrimination, with an employer's reasonable interest in avoiding having to defend stale claims. i think it's important to note that the equal pay act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck accrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on employers that respondents allege would have led congress to never impose a paycheck accrual under title vii.
that's correct.
this is true.
he is saying it's a trespass; get off my land.
not for using canadian facilities to do so.
absolutely because they  a refusal to deal  it covers rights to make and enforce contracts, and if  if the defendant said, i will not deal with this company, then i think that they have a right. and in this case, there was a claim that was brought by the company for  based on  for breach of contract.
they do.
they had everything they needed to 13 challenge the aggravation 
it's the key, because the consideration of the circumstances of the crime is not the problem that we have. what we have is that the jury's told to consider this fact or this finding that the jury understands makes the defendant  because the state has said this is a reason both to make him death-eligible and a reason to impose death  creates a weight on death's side of the scale.
no, your honor. we have found no case, either way 
i  i know that our office handles all the habeas  habeas corpus 
no. but when someone has a conviction, when you have a felony conviction, you're on some notice of inquiry.
so if we had exactly the facts of this case and there's a common law ejectment, you would not say that it goes to federal court. it would stay in state court.
yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?
it's obstruction when you refuse to give them what you give what you give everybody else.
but the reason for that, i take it, is that fifra does not  i mean, i think you agree fifra does not provide an independent private right of action.
 not like most incentive programs i've heard about.
i don't think it's pushing it, i think it's there.
whatever the reason for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say that the pleading requirement being different and much more specific, the amendment process should be different.
you shouldn't defer here because in williamson county, you required that parties go through two litigations.
but medellin's theory that avena should be applied as a binding rule of judgement, even without subsequent proceedings before the icj, could be taken to support granting habeas relief in other proceedings for individuals whose cases weren't litigated, particularly given that the icj in avena purports 
which is happening in the  in the truck when it has an accident.
i 
mr. hallward-driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions. if the court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to impose such conditions; isn't that so?
but there are a number of states that do 
are there any 
i do  i do ask that the state legislatures think about what they're doing. and as i demonstrated 
that's  that's right. but 10 why is the requirement on your reading to challenge it 11 promptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not 12 a just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be 13 met and will result in a consequence that all state 14 convictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect, 15 insulated from later collateral attack when  under  16 for purpose of 2255?
but the 
and if the employer is presently applying, and knowingly and intentionally doing so, a 20 percent differential for male and female employees for no reason other than the gender of the employees, that's a present violation.
no. no. what would happen is you just dismiss the complaint. so  i guess again the reason they have these things is they get a certain number of complaints, they have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth, they don't know what the claim is, they don't understand it, there are a lot of things written here; the person wasn't represented; it's hard to make out. and for, the judge thinks i have to go through all these papers; i have to figure out if there is something here that was exhausted, we know something happened; it was something exhausted  so the simplest thing is just dismiss it. now the prisoner can always refile it with the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted. now is  and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.
the 
 assistance of counsel claim 
that's right.
well, if we owe deference to both, and i would have thought that we did, then i think in the nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the court came to the conclusion that the statute of nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases. so if giving official deference to nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we reach a different conclusion here?
they asked the district court to resolve it. they said the district court should resolve it in the first instance, and then they would review it, presumably.
no. what flast makes clear is that you can challenge a congressional statute that is a taxing and spending statute. and i think to understand the circumstances in which you should give rise to taxpayer standing, you need two things: you need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the government. and that's precisely what 
he stood at the door. he opened the screen door and said, police 
and what  when would it be an abuse of discretion?
no. but, you see  but my point is 
certainly, your honor.
i think ultimately it's a question of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment.
did you come here having researched all about dogs in 1790? (laughter.)
so, doesn't that put them in the position of sometimes having to file that  the habeas petition while the cert petition is still pending, if they file one?
this court has identified it on several occasions as to avoid unnecessary violence to the property, avoid unnecessary possible injury to people, both to the officers who are executing the warrant and people inside, and to allow the person inside to prepare to answer  as mr. moran indicated, if they might be in a state of undress or something, they could avoid that embarrassment.
that's a report. is that not a report?
 the speech externally, i think there  that he ultimately would have lost, as well 
no, no, but i  i'm not saying that it  it does. the state can do nothing if it wants to. but the statute that you just quoted requires her to assign to the state her right to recover for  for her medical expenses. she says, i have done that. in fact, i've done that as a matter of law, under arkansas law. you've got your assignment. number two, i'm giving you the portion of the recovery that i got with respect to medical payments. you can have it. now, there's a difference between what you paid and what i got attributable to medical payments, an amount, by the way, which you stipulated was correct. so if you want the difference, sue for it. go ahead. it's fine with me. why isn't that the answer?
excuse me.
and they  they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on hurtz, apart from maples?
 allow 
and as justice scalia said and as i was considering in asking my question, in your case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and intentional, in some sense, act when  when the person bought  bought the weapons. she says the intent, of course, was induced by  by the threat. it seems to me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity case.
this charge is different and you're correct in that, justice ginsburg. however, future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this case, just the same as it did in graham, and so  and in johnson. the court said that this kind of evidence, the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect within future dangerousness in some manner. and granted we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to culpability, but the court explained  and this was what the state court was working with at the time it considered this claim  this court explained that just because we can imagine other ways in which it might be relevant doesn't mean that we have got eighth amendment error. it's just important that the jury had some way of getting to it. and i don't see how this is markedly different than the evidence that the court said fit within future dangerousness in graham. now, in  i think another thing that i need to mention about cole is, is that my colleague noted the expert testimony that cole lacked impulse control. now, i think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in this case becomes especially apparent when you realize that, that cole planned this crime 2 days in advance. he planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days before he did it. and so i don't think that an impulse control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime in any way and i don't think any reasonable juror would ever see that. so i think that the mitigating significance of that evidence in this case is severely diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury heard in penry, for example, which is that he'll never learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a murder and a rape. and so the mitigating relevance of that evidence was only aggravating within future dangerousness.
that's not my question, and  and it relates to what is the burden of the state in these situations to use the visible restraints?
and isn't there a distinction between unitary status and unitary condition? unitary condition is a descriptive situation. it describes a district in which there is, in fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure segregation; isn't that correct? there is such a thing as unitary, a unitary condition?
that's true. it's  i meant in the 
if in 1/10 of 1 percent of the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation, that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.
 the office of legal counsel and the comptroller on this issue. and congress actually stepped into the fray and created an exception. but it created a limited exception 
i think 
no, but you would agree that the officer could testify to some of the things that happened during the emergency, and he's a witness to that extent.
but craig against boren was 
that would  that would be the  if you  if you're correct about the limits of the probate exception, that issue would be open for review by the ninth circuit.
that's discretionary 
thank you, counsel. ms. mahoney.
but how can you say 
and i  and that's just, it seemed to me, so far been missing from the discussion.
yes, there was. the eighth circuit did so and the  the lowest limit there was $275 per election, which would be $500 for  for the  the entire election cycle. and the  and  but really that  that was on a  a record that this court found to be, frankly, inadequate to  to raise any serious questions about the  whether the amounts concerned gave rise to a realistic threat of corruption. and the record here demonstrates that  that the  that the only time really there is a actuality or perception of corruption in vermont is when they  is when we're talking about amounts in excess of $1,000. that was the prior limit.
well, i  i think the logical reading is that it  it modifies payment.
but it could be the slightest direct cause, which is justice scalia's point.
exactly.
with respect, your honor, we'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute of limitations does bring to the officer. and as far as the burden on the court, whether all cases are stayed or some cases are stayed, of course, we're content to have this court or the district court handling the case figure that out. but the main point that i would make is that a rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes of the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's interest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as i indicated, at a minimum every victim of a fourth amendment violation has the right to some damages. that is actually precisely why we say that fourth amendment claims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction.
what would  if they had done that, what would have been different from what happened in this case?
the  the individual in that case, your honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have to show specific facts demonstrating injury, redressibility and traceability. now in this case 
i would be happy to represent the cattlemen in that circumstance, saying, "you still have not an associational right, but a right not to be singled out to support government speech." but it would be a different and more difficult claim. one. two, this court doesn't have before it the possibility of rewriting all of this. three, there was a severability provision in an earlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if you could lop something off, it would be okay. but that was eliminated in the current law. and, finally, any attempts to analogize this to the cases like lehnert and keller, in terms of remedy, that maybe we can create some scheme where only the objectionable part is returned, is fundamentally incoherent, because what is objectionable here is homogenizing all of these people into some one message, and putting it out through this elaborate structure that purports to represent them.
it's not brought by the united states as long as he's still there.
well, the challenge does cease being peremptory because the equal protection clause has overturned the state statute that provides that challenges  peremptory challenges are challenges for which no reason need be given.
what  which said what?
mr. waxman, it seems to me that the  the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one  or at least i think the best  is the one that mr. lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's  there's a 30-day provision in there, which in effect says congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. and that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of  of damages litigation, including depositions, and  and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously. what is your argument? what is your response to that incompatibility argument?
but isn't the effect of what you're arguing that you can't do it? because you  the government would have to pay the same amount that  by the  that the rent is being reduced. we'd have to figure out how much higher the rent would have been, and  so it  it would be a  a nonsensical thing for the government to engage in.
what was the acreage there?
well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? is that your position?
the respondents concede that the question is "private person under like circumstances." we concede that point. our point is simply that, on a motion to dismiss, the ninth circuit was faced with trying to decide: what would arizona law be with a private person under like circumstances?
right.
 and a summary of the evidence relied on. now, i'm just reading that. what is it i'm reading?
that is correct, your honor. jurek was a facial challenge. but in johnson and graham the court made it pretty clear, i think, that as long as the evidence is relevant in some way within those special issues, some mitigating way 
well, how about excluding from the forklift forever or a year? you can't work the forklift for a year.
if we  if we are unsure, if it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws of canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?
so the reason that i thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of states. say, new hampshire, i think, for example  when i was in the first circuit, there were several states that on the books permitted the death penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. and  and that's true across the country. there are a number of states like that. so if we look at the states that actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of the population are in such states. you go back 15 years, and you get these three other states, which raises the percentage. how  how should i understand that? i'm interested in both sides 
well, i'm just  let's focus on what is a vessel because someone  it may be a vessel but the injured person may not be a seaman. those are two different things. this is only the first step. so when you're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a croupier or whatever, the only question that we are considering is, is this dredge a vessel? we're not involved with the question of whether the worker is a seaman unless we pass that basic threshold.
and that might be an issue that on remand  and this case is being remanded on a couple of issues that aren't even before this court.
i agree that it's  it's somewhat confusing, your honor, but we would submit that the government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if two people conspired in  if two people in florida conspired to commit a money laundering offense in california, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy would lay in california.
why isn't this a classic willful-ignorance case?
i think an answer i need to give to  to cut through all of this is that third party standing is never predicated on the impossible. third party standing is never predicated on the idea that third party standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some indigent to make it into court or some third party or the person whose rights are being violated to make it into court. all that must be shown from this court's precedents is a hindrance. so this court did not require in craig v. boren that it was impossible that some young man could get his claim in front of the court.
yes. i was going to get there, your honor, but in fact, your honor, respectfully, i hate to disagree with your honor, but i believe you're incorrect. is that what you see in the class action fairness act, for example  and we filed it in our brief  the house and senate committee reports which discussed this case and the fact that the majority of circuits of the circuit courts have agreed with our view  there has been no class actions of any materiality filed. in fact, they made the note in 1999 or '97 more class actions were certified in one county in illinois than filed and certified in the entire federal system. and the reason they said that is because most plaintiffs lawyers, notwithstanding zahn  it isn't  zahn isn't the issue. snyder was the issue. it's aggregation that's the issue. all plaintiffs lawyers had to do to avoid removal is simply put named plaintiffs that don't meet the jurisdictional standards for diversity, create imperfect diversity, have amounts in controversy of less than the amount in controversy required, and then they could never be removed. so zahn is simply a footnote, and it got it  all the billing of zahn, zahn, zahn  the reality is the predecessor to zahn, which is snyder that says that you can't aggregate under 1332 the amount in controversy, that was the significant decision. and what congress has now done a few weeks ago is to take up the snyder case and has overruled snyder. and what they've done is to say, when there's an aggregate claim of more than $5 million, it goes into federal court. but look at what congress has said. look at 
it seems to me your argument is much like arguing on the merits of the  at the original trial that his defense was alibi or something like that, therefore you don't have to worry about the prejudice that arises from the restraints.
well, what the state is protecting, justice kennedy, is not the first amendment right itself which by definition is protected through the hudson process.
well, i'm just 
i realize you may disagree with me on that, but  [laughter.]
right.
good catch.
 on that.
well 
justice scalia 
could you do it concretely, mr. verrilli, for this case. the defendant is being rather obstreperous and says: i don't want any mitigating evidence; i'm a really bad guy. and that's how he's trying to portray himself. what  you said, and you allow for the possibility that there could be a knowing waiver of mitigation. what would have had to transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?
thank you, ms. zapp. ms. lovitt.
and  and there was no further discussion of it after  after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?
that's a holding? they  they held that?
and that would be unconstitutional as well.
to the extent you're suggesting that we just look to general theories of tort law, i think that would be incorrect. the  because the tort claims act  the language of the tort claims act makes the united states liable only where a private party in like circumstances would be liable. and in indian towing, this court defines "in like circumstances" as looking to the same character of conduct of the  of the person. so, you would have to find a private person who's engaged in the same character of conduct, and then ask the question, what principles of liability does the state apply to those persons? here, the 
well 
obviously, if there's just an anticompetitive act without a violation of the statute, then there would be no basis for damages.
mr. rosenkranz, the items you listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what i took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that the decision below was wrong because the federal circuit simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared for purposes of the ind, as opposed to materials prepared for the  for the drug application, later on. are you abandoning that more expansive position?
social security  social security said it would be  it would be a  it would  a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read it, on social security setoffs for educational loans.
all right. then is that an issue that we should consider on a question of preemption which arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?
mr. chief justice, it  it just doesn't hang on a particular number. it  it turns on whether or not the district is an opportunity district, and if it isn't an opportunity district, why is the state sitting down and using race for its own sake to be able to say we got 50.9 percent latino voting age population? we managed to zigzag that boundary through the streets and  and through the neighborhoods of the city of laredo so that we could say it was a latino majority district.
your honor, the california supreme court reasonably applied boyde's holding, that factor (k) did call for consideration of character evidence, and that's precisely what payton presented 
 would be true. but 
thank you, general. mr. bagenstos.
for purposes of this provision. there  there are other provisions where the word located encompasses branch locations, but for purposes of this provision, we think location is synonymous with main office. and i would say that the court of appeals assumed in its opinion, by the way  and this is at pages 8a and 11a of the  of the petition appendix  that it's rarely going to be the case that a national bank's main office will  will deviate from the national bank's principal place of business.
i  i believe the state might dispute that. i'm not sure. what the michigan constitution does, justice o'connor, if i may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have  they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal. and so the michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method. and so michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other states, virginia, west virginia, and  and several other states have guilty plea appeals.
between a variance  official
there is no harmless error question, correct, mr. chief justice. however, i think when we're looking at the boyde standard, which is  and in johnson  a reasonable likelihood that the jury was precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the reasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of that possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the jury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of that evidence. and so evidence of intoxication, for example, while it does mitigate culpability in some manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of eighth amendment error in that sense.
this would be a good equal pay act case, wouldn't it?
justice ginsburg, i believe that both mrs. williams and the trust are in the same position. both of them paid the tax. both were third parties. neither was a taxpayer. in the case of williams, the taxpayer was her husband. in the case of the trust 
"plan to do anything in violation of this section," which is not just obstructing commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.
i'll reread it. [laughter.]
sorry, i'll 
justice alito, that's why i qualified my answer to justice stevens, because i think that the question his hypothetical raises, like your question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence necessary to prove intent during the charge filing period. and i don't want in any way to be heard that there is anything in our position in this case that tries to answer that question. the reason i'm not trying to answer that question in this case is because that question is not before the court except with one small respect. if the only thing that the plaintiff is relying upon is discrimination outside of the charge filing period, that is legally insufficient under this court's cases in evans, ricks, lorance and machinists before it. what bazemore dealt with was a case very much like your hypothetical, justice alito, of an allegation of an ongoing racial classification during the actionable time period. and it was because of that allegation of ongoing actionable racial classification and pay that there was both a timely claim, and according to justice brennan's opinion for all nine members of the court of that  in that case, a very serious potential error by the district court in that case as to whether or not it had been clearly erroneous in holding that the united states had failed its proof of proving an ongoing intentional race discrimination case 
mr. kasner, the  does the securities and exchange commission have enforcement authority in this  in this area?
i thought (b) and (c)  tell if i'm right about this  but suppose an individual bankruptcy, and sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an automobile accident and ran into a state building and wrecked it. all right? now, i take it that, in a state that hasn't waived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something. each is claiming the other is negligent. i guess the person wouldn't 10 be able to file. and the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't, 11 either.
well, although we would submit this district is reasonably compact.
the trunk of the vehicle did not have to be opened here. you're talking about a dog sniffing on the exterior of the vehicle that was legitimately stopped for a traffic violation.
does it apply in the prison in this case  the rehab act?
could i  could i bring you back to your  your earlier discussion of a spy who is also a  a government employee? are you telling me that he  he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because the work he was doing was  was espionage? i mean, he's  he's a gs-whatever, gs-16, and the government just doesn't send him his monthly check.
what limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action? where do they come from?
so you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive. you can't take race into account if it's not compact.
well, one of the problems for me is the ninth circuit seems to think that it has a theory  and it is the theory of your complaint  that's different from, say, the third circuit. the ninth circuit says we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an inflated price, and the ninth circuit thinks that's different from a circuit that says you don't have any loss until somehow the bad news comes out and there's a drop in price as a result.
right.
what?
i still don't understand the distinction between the california system and a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review. let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred years. and let's say you have two judges who have these cases. and one sentences the defendant to zero, probation. the other one sentences the defendant to a hundred years. without saying a word of explanation for either sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen zero or why you have chosen 100? and if the trial judge provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the judge believes to be true about the offense and the offender?
yes.
my point was simply that this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse. this was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night, so that the  the police response was to the noise, not to the violence.
this would be at  least your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would  would be more administrable if we're dealing with the elimination of a district than if we were dealing with the question of creating one. do you take the position that the naac brief does that there really should be distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking to create something new or preserve something which has been in place?
in other words, you say the  the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor other than age. your question is whether the use of those factors was overall reasonable.
mr. meade, the government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code.
ms. sullivan?
well, just to  stop there. why is the trial court better suited to apply the edwards rule to a set of facts that we would  we accept based on deference to the factfinder?
let me ask on that, ms. bonner, what typically in florida is the time elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral relief?
if you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out.
or suppose you have a fraud where the only party that had relied was the government, in which case you don't need them for civil rico. and the strong argument, i think, would be where that's the case, cut it off because of all the indirect problems that holmes goes into. i'm not  i'm not accepting it. i'm just trying 
it's a federal writ, isn't it? it's an application for a federal writ. it's not an appeal in state criminal  state case.
i think 
well, the state certainly could have moved webb county whole out of the district. it depends on how they would have done the overall 
black had and almanza had.
so  so that if you charged 
causation.
yes.
would your answer here be exactly the same if there had been 12 african american prospective jurors and all 12 were struck? does that make a difference?
because the statute, which is now in effect  and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of prudential standing 
but there are other provisions than "no action shall be brought." take a statute of limitations that reads "no action shall be brought after two years" or something like that. there is no action shall be brought. does that make it no longer an affirmative defense?
it's not at all mitigating.
you  you want a trial-type proceeding.
where does it say that? let  let me come back to the  to the section of the statute you're quoting. you didn't finish the sentence. it says that it's not an unreasonable burden when the state registration is completed under standards of the secretary under subsection (c). subsection (c) is entitled ssrs, single state registration system.
see, he goes  there's nobody. all there is is the ring. nobody else makes any claim to it whatsoever. now can the  can the trustee get it?
 is unreasonable 
mr. van amberg, they were essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they not? and those regulations had gone through the notice and comment process.
the  i think it makes no difference. the fact of the reality is that it's in the contract.
but if 
well 
the  the point is what if we don't have that simple of a situation. let  let me ask you this. maybe we can short-circuit this. i mean, do you represent as an  as a statement of vermont law that this court should decide the case on the assumption that the presumption is a disappearing presumption, once evidence is offered against it?
no, because they  i mean, the argument made by the government: "of course not, because the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this congressional legislation." they didn't exist, before; and they've become common, afterwards. now  you know, i  you can say 
does not require premeditation. and i 
that seems to be very strange, because i think our cases require  require that for death eligibility, and 
we did not, and do not. now, i  there may be arguments that might be made, that are not before this court, with respect to the whole idea of 
i think the court 
yes.
the other point i think with regard to that, your honor, is in looking at 3553(a) that statute gives the district court the dual commands of first considering all of those factors and then imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary. the statute does not give to the sentencing commission that obligation.
the  the citation to what is now 
i don't believe the court should 
mr. mitchell, my  my problem is even more fundamental than justice souter's. conceding that the rule in mississippi is exactly the same as the federal rule in beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing mississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as federal law, amounts to raising a federal question. let's assume you have a  a state law against wire-tapping. it is unlawful. and you  you come in and you ask that the evidence be  be excluded because it's contrary to the state law. have you raised a  a federal  a federal question when all you cite is the state law, even though the effect under state law is the same as the federal effect under the fourth amendment? it's not my understanding that you've raised a federal question.
which was a question you said 
yes, okay 
there might be. i don't know.
and this doesn't have to do with whistleblowing.
 but that his expectation is irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case, we assume, had the right to admit them to an area which was under her control, as well as his. is  have i got it correct?
that conduct  it could be conduct  you could say exactly your same question, just as the chief just said. i mean, i don't know how to get around this. you could say the question was, does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being pursued for a murder 
well, we have disputed petitioner's position that this is a search, although suspicionless, that it is  that discretion is not circumscribed is our position. and it is, because 
he thought he was killing another individual.
can you 
i'm asking, if i disagreed with you that i thought  we take the facts of moore, where he's a drug pusher, the doctor, and, for some unknown reason, the state says, "that's fine, it doesn't violate state law," but the attorney general says, "do what you want about state law. i think it violates the federal law." suppose i think the attorney general does have the right to do that for  assuming it  assuming it  then what do you say about this case?
 why the government would want to police the one, and let the other, you know, proliferate, seems very strange to me.
i guess what they would say is that there  they insist only that the agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2, and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader agreement is enforceable.
in its order, it references 276 and 201. in the regulations  i thought i was being asked official about the regulations  it leads with 276.
our  our standard of prejudice, our preferred standard of prejudice, is the same as under strickland. we would not require the defendant to show that his second-choice retained counsel performed incompetently. second-choice retained counsel can perform fully competently and have made a significantly different strategic course of action than the counsel who actually went to trial, and that could easily be established by having an affidavit or testimony submitted. it's actually easier than conducting a strickland inquiry because in strickland, you're looking at the way counsel performed and your hypothesizing how a competent counsel would perform.
why can he get a discharge if he's disabled?
thank you, mr. casey. the case is submitted.
with respect, i think it is not  it is not a fiction with respect to the constitutional issue because there's a critical difference between, for example, a lawful permanent resident  a person does not acquire lawful permanent resident status by something like adverse possession, by living in the united states for a long period of time. it is an affirmative grant of status for permission to reside permanently in the united states. it is a grant of a status 
correct.
the confrontation clause bars under crawford police interrogation. and the  the situation is one in which we are not going to be able to examine the individual motives of officers in every case and individual declarants in every case. what we are looking for is a categorical rule that is going to capture the likely motivations in both cases, and when you have emergency question, you're likely dealing with the situation with  both from the officer's side and from the declarant's side, you're going to be having people attempting to resolve an immediate danger of harm. and you get 
no.
we ultimately rely upon the text of the statute, your honor, irrespective of all of the policy or the political arguments that have been made to the court. we believe and have maintained throughout that the text of the statute requires 
his contract with  with the corporation?
 informal process 
no. well 
you said remand was proper. that's the 
well, except for this problem  i mean, the other problem you have is that we don't  all we know is that it wasn't  it  it came back unclaimed. so we don't even know that it didn't get delivered. all we know is that no one was prepared to sign for it and accept it. we don't know, as justice breyer's hypothetical 
on page 12  26 to 27.
thank you, general clement. mr. pincus.
alaska is arguing, as i understand it now, that the  the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law, which is a point that you disagree on. what  what is your response to their response to 
 would be an injury rising 
i  i don't believe it is, 2 justice souter. i don't think there's any kind of time 3 limitation there the way there is in the guidelines. the  the 
so, it didn't  it didn't depend on the entry or anything gained as a result of the entry, right?
in those cases, your honor, they work differently than slusa for two reasons. one, they're the whether  not whether it will be tried, but where it will be tried. and when congress  and when it was only a where question, congress puts in a specific provision. the other is cafa, for example, is expressly jurisdictional. it amends the diversity statute. so there's no argument that it would be within thermtron. every cafa question is a 1447(c) issue. congress had to make it. here, congress knew about thermtron. congress has known about thermtron for 30 years. this court reaffirmed thermtron while they were debating slusa. and congress knew that this question was not jurisdictional. congress decoupled them, just as this court described in arbaugh.
if  if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why  why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?
so that means that the defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. only the lawyers arguably could.
well, i wouldn't say he could immediately reconvert. again, there is the due process requirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be heard on the issue.
well, the fifth circuit reserved that question.
well, you had no  - i mean, you had no real reason to do it. you had somebody there who accepted responsibility, in the sense that they were willing to defend on the merits, right?
if it is applied here, i  i thought we just granted question one. there were two in the cert petition. i  my notes say we just granted question one. and that means what they have is the screen. we're going to screen out absolutely any such claim as yours if there is probable cause. now, the reason they advance for doing that is that in the  a reason is in the absence of a screen like that, here's what's going to happen. every single case  not every one, but millions of cases or thousands, anyway  involving companies  well, companies are going to congress all the time. they have ads all the time. they run into agency hostility all the time. the hell's angels? that's a pretty unpopular defendant. they say things all the time that investigators disagree with. and what will happen is in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to bring a bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every statement that the  the investigator made to the prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare of tort cases. and they say that's unfortunate to cut off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors totally cut them off because they have absolute immunity. now, we're saying at least let's restrict them, where investigators are involved, to cases where it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise the criminal process itself will be seriously injured. now, i take it that's the argument. i'd like to hear your reply.
do we take judicial notice that a ceo knows these things and that's the strong inference.
and it's putting that on the disk and then it makes other things happen.
yes, but the government 
so i don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.
 this court 
in mcconnell against fec, you stood there and told us that this was a facial challenge and that as-applied challenges could be brought in the future. this is an as-applied challenge and now you're telling us that it's already been decided. it's a classic bait and switch.
it's possible that the cia would assert that there is some reason that it gave less than its regulations that would be a state secret. it's hard for us to imagine what that would be, but in fact that is open on remand for the  for the cia to argue that.
no, your honor, none whatsoever.
really?
it's continuing.
but you're telling us that some do this and some do that and the question is why wouldn't following one protocol rather than another protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?
but don't you think that the telecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at least as important as the information aspect of it? the information is useless unless it can be conveyed.
 would he be guilty, or not?
that is the  it is the chief of the air and waste management division, james official wolburn, giving guidance to region 4. region 4 is not only alabama, it is also north carolina and south carolina. and then, in the wake of this, right? 1982, north carolina and south carolina submit their sips and in their sips, certainly the south carolina sip expressly incorporates the concept of modification. north carolina a little less expressly incorporates the entirety of the regulatory scheme under title 50  under part 51 of the code of federal regulations.
two, three, four, five years.
there can be no  no  well, i assume you have a  a tort  tort claims act that waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances.
 they needed to know. but 19 still, if you say to me i'm going to put on certain 20 exhibits, a, b, and c, and the defense says i'm not even 21 going to even take a look at them before you put them on, 22 i find that quite unusual.
he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
well, they 
yes. our position 
that's correct, your honor. because the guidelines don't take into account all the myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into account the military record, the employment record, mr. rita's health concerns. the guidelines specifically did not take those into account.
i would like to even sharpen justice breyer's hypothetical. let's assume that the indictment did set forth what the overt act was. it did. but there was no evidence of that overt act introduced before the grand jury. what would the result of that be?
i see.
i'm happy to hear that. that's all i was trying to establish. you  you don't assert that that's an independent basis.
no, because it's a  it's simply a product of where the 
thank you, mr. phillips.
if the particular protocol that was alleged in the sentence, yes, it would be ripe at that point in time as opposed to florida's system where it's within  it's within the discretion of the department of correction to change it at any time. we've seen that happen whenever the electric chair litigation was going on, that they changed these procedures over time, adding and detracting different things.
well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the government actually will have available to spend?
but we come back to the historical derivation of how this statute came into  into being, and it did come in in response to smith against robinson.
 where we had, you know, a pumping of water from one polluted body into another, and it was held  we held that that was not a discharge?
the  is that  is there any reason to believe that the judge, of course, would clarify it and say the ends of justice, if we took your remand solution.
well, mr. chaney's testimony has to be viewed in contact  in context, justice ginsburg. he was not called as a 30(b)(6) witness as a corporate  for a corporate form and structure. the testimony that was being elicited was to see whether lincoln had other entities and ownership of properties in virginia so that they could attempt to prove that there was a problem that the parent company, lincoln property company, knew about. there was a high degree of imprecision in the deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, i think, that the lawyer and the witness did not understand what each other were talking about. yet in the discovery process, not a single question was presented that would get at the organizational structure of lincoln. there was not any attempt to get behind the management documents between swib and lincoln property. it was one very small snippet of a deposition which has been taken out of context and, we would submit, blown out of proportion by the respondents in their submissions in this case.
no, it was not involving a party or noise.
 do with the case. the lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of the case. but, what about the words "on the merits"? and there, what i think the court wrote is that the fact that it says "on the merits" doesn't prove it  what  it doesn't prove that it was timely. why? and then i listed a bunch of reasons. there are reasons. sometimes courts say "on the merits," even though it's delayed. all right? they say "on the merits." or because they want to tell the prisoner or  there are a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed. so, we send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month delay, given the excuses, was still timely. we  all right?
 so long as it's clearly expressed.
do you think, as a minimum, that they authorized a military commission?
 "substances act."
well, i  i think the 
i think so, your honor, and the penry court was not specific about what that definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to the jury in this case and in taking account some of this evidence that was before it.
justice stevens, i don't think we have taken, the federal government hasn't taken a definitive position on that. i think it could be interpreted either way. i think my understanding is the face context, a free clinic would be covered. there's not a jurisdictional element in the face statute. so there may be differences as, in application.
i don't think that the district judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.
but it was in the 1991 statute.
so that you do say that you at least will give the state the opportunity to decide whether it wants to try and remedy it in an informal or hasty manner.
what about a defense that i was on drugs and  and didn't know what i was doing because of that and couldn't form the requisite intent? does the government have to disprove that as well?
the master  well, at&t has taken two positions on that. we 
all right. isn't it the case that the two texas determinations can be respected and still, in the federal court, enter a judgment for tort liability against your client?
and he killed one, at least one. and that one sued and said: i want extra punitive damages because all these other people were subjected to the same risk. wouldn't that be a proper consideration?
 there are about 3,000 
so you're saying there just is not a logical connection there within 
may i ask two questions? seems to me you're  if we're using social analogies in what happens, i imagine that it would make a difference if the person who wants to  who was invited in by the wife, is larger or smaller than the husband. [laughter.]
because the group of voters who had withdrawn their support were latino voters. the district court discusses the  the interrelationship of these phenomenon in its opinion at jurisdictional statement appendix 128 when it says, the state acted to shore up the incumbency of congressman bonilla, and the next sentence is, his support among latino voters had dropped to 8 percent. it was, in fact, the  the voting behavior of latinos as opposed to anybody else who had caused the incumbency crisis, and it was latinos as latinos who were removed from the district. at the same time, however, the redistricters sat down and figured out exactly how many latinos they wanted to leave inside this district to achieve a bare, razor-thin latino voting age majority population, and that was done to give the impression of latino support for the incumbent. the chief redistricter 
yes, but here it was a warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular goods. so, the entry of the home was not illegal. the entering of the home was perfectly okay. what was illegal was not knocking and announcing in advance. it seems to me that's quite a different  quite a different issue, and the causality is quite different.
what fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?
but 703 has the language and 704 doesn't. i mean, 703 has language limiting it to  to employment, prerogatives of employment. 704 doesn't.
excuse me?
why there's a necessity for an ongoing suit.
communicated that to her, which they never did. instead they just kept telling her, you can call back later, call back later. they never made the probable cause determination and conveyed it to her.
right.
if that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that mr. schaerr read?
were you 
how  how is that different from the forgery hypothetical?
thank you, mr. fermino.
 (i) 
well, let's go to 
i think something probably like that would be. but this  again, this went way beyond that. the other thing that you have to look at here is that then he goes on to say, and if you don't give him death chaos will reign, society will fall apart, there's no point in having a death penalty, and the animals will reign in the jungle and you can't that have that in a civilized society.
that's correct, justice scalia. now, the 
but  but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?
necessary.
his claims here  if his claims here are correct.
again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over. you really didn't know that until the trial. for all you knew, they might have found in addition to the confession, they might have found eyewitnesss who would have identified your client. you couldn't tell that until the trial.
no, no, no. i'm saying the state typically decides against the defendant. they decide against the defendant on a federal issue. there's a perfectly adequate state issue. it's called failure to object, and they don't mention it. i'd be repeating myself. are you following what my, my  and i'm saying is there any case you found anywhere which says after that occurred that the state when it gets a hold of the case again can say, oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate state ground, bad luck? i've never seen such a thing. i doubt that you have.
well, you can  you can say the same thing of  of res judicata, that there is a complete bar. i guess my concern here is that this seems to be, with respect to the employee, something much closer to a res judicata case than to an immunity per se case.
are you telling me just based on your experience that in justice kennedy's hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?
yes, there is and the reason why there is a difference is that the  the fees that are paid for plating are under the  under the international reciprocity plan, the registration plan, the irp. and that is an apportioned fee. it is charged to all vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-state or  of interstate. so everybody pays their apportioned amount based on mileage.
i  i mean, again with the caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the administrative 
you  you say we don't know whether the  the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?
well, except that it is none of their business.
well, your honor, i think that the state's concession, as justice scalia pointed out, is not the beginning and end of it, in the first instance. secondly, it 
20-  i'm sorry. at the time that was enacted, were there any limitations in other statutes on the commencement of administrative proceedings?
well, except the four commandments and moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the ten commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two.
that's correct. and it's sort of interesting that neither the petitioners, the united states, or any of the amici have cited a california whistle-blower statute that would have been applicable to this claim. i  frankly, i think that there was one that potentially might have been applicable, not cited by any of the parties, but the law was in flux, and it really wasn't all that clear. and that's  and california's probably one of the better states, in terms of whistle-blower protections, compared to  and we're talking about a local government employee, and the odds of protection  it's just hit or miss across the country.
that's correct, your honor. and it's certainly is not our argument that it would not apply to the penalty phase. however, there simply may be other considerations, because the fundamental fairness standard essentially answers the question, did the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.
 are going to be.
i mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip. i mean, justice ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?
well, if one thinks of upstream waters and downstream waters, it  our view is that upstream waters simply become downstream waters as they flow through the dam. one doesn't discharge into another. i would  i would concede that very bright people working very hard with virtually any words in the english language can find some way to reach a point to say that perhaps something fits something. but, at some point  at some point, i think we need to ask, is  if congress uses the same word throughout the statute to always mean putting something into water, then how do we get to the conclusion that what that really means is doing anything to the water is always  - because 
because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.
well, what this  what  what happens under rule 56 
what  what do you we make of the fact that two senators apparently don't agree with that position? i mean, i  i'm referring to the colloquy that was quoted in  in one of the  the briefs about the recent legislation, and the  the substance of the colloquy was we're not making any change in the law, we're just clarifying it. well, in fact, if there is no textual difference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it concerns these  these so-called discrimination recoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the same problem that justice o'connor is talking about, shouldn't we infer that at least the senate of the united states assumes that this does not get into gross?
but black had.
yes. yes, but 
 a pretty easy case, wouldn't it? i mean, if you have a mechanism saying some  an alien in this position can apply for, you know, this type of relief, this type of relief, or another, and they say, "well, we're not going to allow this type of relief anymore. we're going to change those"  was  that's a pretty easy case, under landgraf, isn't it?
the court didn't like that either.
 and can't think of any reason why that would be an additional constitutional requirement. and i'm putting that directly to you, because i want to hear you give me the counterexamples.
that particular issue, i think the appeal of the second case is pending before the district court. i think that the bankruptcy judge disposed of the case pretty summarily and decided that while this particular debtor, just looking at the schedules, does not have the eligibility requirements for the second case, and therefore dismissed it. that does not necessarily preclude a finding official upon the facts in the first case which is still pending, that it could be converted. i think candidly, i need to say that.
 mr. kneedler, i think everyone would concede that there is a compelling interest, governmental interest, to have the controlled substances act on that level, yes. but then, congress has passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject to rfra  shall be subject to rfra. so, we can't just look at "is there a compelling state interest for the controlled substances act?" in a vacuum. we have to take what was a later statute, rfra, to which the controlled substances act is made subject by congress. and i thought the argument was: is there a compelling state interest in that context? how can there be, given the situation with peyote and, "we're just like the native american church in that regard"?
what would you do then?
but why  why couldn't you use it in the other case? couldn't you ask the police officer what he  who conducted the investigation what the facts really were?
well, i don't think congress can be said to have intended or envisioned that they would cure every problem in the world. it's a very, very narrow category of american citizens convicted abroad who come back here.
and if lawrence had gone the other way, then it also  then it would be right. in other words, whether aedpa applies really is a function of our decision in lawrence?
that's a principle that you derive from what? from the sixth amendment? from the sentencing reform act? from where?
 borderline case 
what was the second  the definition of "second degree"?
justice breyer quoted from the osterneck case. there was another statement of the rule which goes like this: there is a sharply honed exception covering cases in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct rather than incorrect information. this case fits right into that description, doesn't it?
she says that.
well, that's easy. if you are a foreign national, you  that's easy too. i don't  i don't see why this is so complicated.
thank you, counsel. mr. himmelfarb.
well 
does a  someone relying on appointed counsel have the same right? why can't he say to the first person who comes through the door, you know, i've got a  i'd like to see the others before i make a choice?
so it's just  just like an ira.
all right. if it's an abundance of caution, where's the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution?
well, let me tackle that head-on. there were a number of improper comments made in this case. most, many of them  a number of them were objected to and the objection was overruled. some of them were not objected to. the only instructions they got were two curative instructions on two points and a general evidence, not arguments, instruction. so nothing was really done in the context to ameliorate the presence of these comments. and despite what the petitioner says, this was not a strong case for death. the evidence of guilt was circumstantial and hotly contested. even the prosecutor in his penalty phase acknowledged, look, he might be innocent, but kill him anyway. the state presented no additional evidence in aggravation of punishment. mr. weaver had no prior record other than a misdemeanor conviction. there was substantial mitigating evidence presented regarding his character, his good deeds, and other things he had done in the community and his adaptability to confinement. this was not a strong case for death. so you take these comments, which were  they're trying to contrast  this argument is worse than newlon in most respects. it was made five weeks after he was told that this argument rendered another trial fundamentally unfair.
well, your brief says determined. and did  did you 
 rule that would sort of encourage people to go public rather than 
even if i were to grant your assumption of clarity in sullivan, which justice harlan, i presume, would not agree with  he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the court was trying to do. but even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that  that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is  is passed under congress's power under the thirteenth amendment, which is the broadest conceivable 
no, no. they  they say my client is able-bodied now, but we  we need something because  i don't know  there's a history of family illness or something.
it  it certainly may, your honor.
mr. kellogg, the federal rules of civil procedure assiduously avoid using the word fact throughout. and from 1938 on, it has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead facts. the index of forms, the appendix of forms shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is, and you're not required to plead facts. and yet that's the central  seems to be the central thrust of your argument.
no 
well, your honor, i think that if ruling on that motion 
i  i think this is going to be a line-drawing question, but when you have a situation like this one where you have an officer who's just on the scene in the immediate wake of a  of a domestic dispute, he asks a single question, what happened, in  in circumstances in which he needed to know the answer to that question to make sure he could leave and leave her there safely. that's not interrogation. if he sat around for a half hour with a back-and-forth and give-and-take and trying to press and get to the situation in that kind of back-and-forth, that would be interrogation colloquially. and it's  it's that kind of line that the court is going to need to draw.
 then wouldn't that be strong evidence for the defense?
well, what's  what's wrong with that?
well, we believe that that would be permissible. and i think, going back to the joint opinion in woodson versus north carolina, which was really where this constitutional requirement of mitigation was first recognized, this court did not suggest in any way that, to the extent that individualized consideration at sentencing is mandated, a jury is entitled to consider any and all factors that it might think is relevant. instead, the court really recognized a category of mitigating factors that is limited to factors that are traditionally taken into account at sentencing  namely, the character or record of the defendant and the circumstances 
yes, there was, justice scalia. in fact, you know, mr. nixon was  was very much engaged in the guilt phase of this trial. he objected to the introduction of evidence.
because the hispanic population is dispersed enough that one can't  one can't draw 
and if you follow the normal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then, then the burden would be on the prison to do just what it did in the jones case. why, why would we say, depart from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an affirmative defense when we know that the party best equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is the prison, as the jones case showed so well? they, the prison, had all of the grievances. they had all of the responses and they presented that to the court. so the prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers than the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes the most sense because the one most likely to have the information is the prison?
well, you cannot get damages against the state 
the export bans that this court has struck down either created local 
the only 
he can 
of the crime. you could say it. yes, his  his later conversion extenuated the gravity of the crime, not the  not the  when i try to think of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, i say, well, plausible. plausible, not perhaps the best, but plausible, isn't it?
no, your honor, i would - i'm sorry.
normally you don't put in evidence unless you think it will support a proposition that you  that you're in favor of.
but there have been  haven't there been court decisions that have held that buttons didn't compromise a fair trial right?
your honor, if you are referring to the amicus brief, your honor, there are  assuming there are amicus briefs on the other side. the ballunas amicus brief  i think it is fair for the court to look at, to look at the document that the agency had before it. that  that document produced by the national research  research council, that's the research arm of the national academy of sciences. and it's one of the gold standards of research.
 does  can you have an associational enterprise that extends beyond individuals, that gets  that goes beyond the gangs and their family.
that's right?
just out of curiosity, it has nothing to do with the case, do they market this product with color charts, just like paint companies do?
but we don't do that with other provisions of void contracts. i mean, if our contract had a liquidated damages clause  if you didn't go ahead and murder somebody, you'd owe me $1,000  we don't say, well, that part is enforceable even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable. we treat it as a whole. because the subject matter of the contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is  is void and illegal.
that's right, your honor.
the reason that my  i was able to give my hypothetical before 
justice souter was  was a state court judge as well. (laughter.)
not  not harmless you mean.
mr. goldstein, your time is almost up, but i want to know if you place any weight at all on the fact that the husband was the target in this case. the target said, "no," and the one who wasn't under suspicion said, "yes." does that make any difference?
well, it talks about contributions to an employee benefit plan which one would not normally think of as paying insurance premiums.
class action fairness act.
where do we find that evidence?
 a standard proviso 
that would certainly be evidence that black jurors and white jurors were treated differently.
because the way congress structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the fourth one.
 to make 
suppose the  suppose the officer  excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are police officers. we do have a warrant. we're going to proceed with a search. please don't be alarmed. we're going to  does that do it?
 and that is 
that, justice stevens, if this is what the state is saying with respect to the public sector employees as to which it has the authority to regulate the agency fee. this is perfectly constitutional. this is the kind of 
yes, justice souter, if it were part of a  an agreement to a permit that the  that the out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just fine. so, yes, the state can, through internet, so to speak,  internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring  do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the out-of-state winery is paying taxes. and, by the way, michigan does not collect taxes, justice kennedy, through the distributors. michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers. so michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state wineries have to go through the distributors for tax purposes. they're not using the distributors as their tax-collection agents now.
i had asked you if they were still race- and gender-coded. you hadn't gotten to that part of the question. these cards were race-coded and for other things too. right now in the state, do the prosecutors code cards  cards for race and gender?
justice scalia, the patent examiner gave us a patent, initially rejected this patent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after considering all of these things, a statutory presumption of validity attached under section 282. so we have what we say is clear and convincing evidence, the question isn't presented here, but whatever. the other side comes in and tries to knock our patent out. they file a motion, and the motion rests on a piece of prior art. and so what the federal circuit said is, if we're not going to knock all of these patents out by hindsight, all we want to know is one thing and you know, on remand, they may well be able to prove it. we don't think they can. but all it's asking for is for the district court to make a finding that says the other side is right, that it would have been obvious to take asano, which is their only example, and combine it with electronic throttle control in this way. that is what's so 
well, you only 
that's  that's not the same in the state's scheme, is it?
you're lumping them all together, but i think the tests are quite different.
yes.
but we go into that question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity. i mean, if in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to be able to appeal every case.
what about general, mr. cruz's comments that this was a minor point in counsel's summation before the jury?
will you  will you just help me with this? justice stevens answered my question. the word anticipatory. the word anticipatory does suggest it isn't valid for a while. nothing else in the warrant does. what am i supposed to do if i think there's adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right now in respect to 12 of the things? and it's really pretty hard for me to try to understand what this warrant is about if i'm supposed to understand it, by reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and there discovering somewhere in the back of it some  the post office says i'm not going to execute this until this other package gets there too. now, that does make me nervous. that  that supports you.
counsel, i'm looking at the quote, the statement, the reference to patton, and i have to say i don't read it as imposing a duty. it says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk death because it's right. his point is that at some point, at some times, you have to impose death because it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier. now, where is the reference to you have this duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?
he gets the  the accusation. he knows the accusation is made from the report form that is prepared by the prison officials. so he knows 
all right. so  so are you talking about those 98 percent now?
but yellowtail 
well, i think that your honor's point illustrates that this issue of federal law is one that congress has mandated be resolved at the outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for certification over the attorney general's objection the statute allows the attorney general to remove the petition to federal court and the statute states that the district court shall find and certify whether the employee was acting within the scope.
the virginia habeas statute provides a cause of action if you are held in violation of federal law, and in sanchez-llamas, the cause of action is the criminal prosecution. that's what the court did in rauscher where it allowed him to 
but what if  your friend says, what if we never get assessed for any other case? where do we make up this money?
i would  i agree with you, your honor, there is that  there is a possible sliver of a distinction, but i  and, i submit, any lawyer advising a client and any lawyer advising himself or herself  would have a hard time differentiating between the two standards, in practice, so as actually 
can a district court do both? can it say i've reached personal jurisdiction, i conclude that i, we do not have jurisdiction over this case? and in the alternative be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?
 i'm making it harder and harder for you to accept that saying 
and $80 towards irp?
did you say 
yes. i don't perceive a limiting principle to the other side's position. in fact, there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or two stops in the united states a year, and under their view, that ship would be governed by the ada as well. if  if congress wants to enact these limits, it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex area and ships are different from land-based accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate people within 30 minutes. and so when we train people, we have 
 that. and i think  but, equally, i don't think a state would  is required to have a diminished-capacity defense. and 
and we didn't get that.
all right.
i thought that the department of labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers. that was the original department of labor position, wasn't it?
but  but we're not asking for a compulsory license because it is not our intention, going forward, to infringe this patent. we've made it very clear to the district court and the district court recognizes that we not only intend to but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a work-around to this particular patent. and that's what we expect will happen. so we're not asking for the right to continue to infringe and a willingness to pay as we go. our concern  and this does go to the business method patent because it does go to the  to the uncertainty. the problem we have here is we don't know where the line is going to be drawn. that's why the district court said specifically, you know, there's going to be unending litigation on this because it's very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this particular patent, and we're going to have to fight over that, so that the traditional reason for injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't available in this case. we're not going to have peace under these circumstances. and when you have that situation and you have the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method patents generally  that's  that's where i was i think probably giving up too much immediately. i don't think the fact of a business method patent is per se a problem, but i think analyzing the specific business method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate consideration for the district court to take into account in deciding whether or not, in a particular circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how the work-around develops, and take it into account, but without the sort of 
that is correct, and 
thank you, counsel.
yes, your honor. there may be more jurors that have been subject to voir dire if a six pack is used, but challenges are only made to those in the box when the box is full, there's a full complement of jurors.
mr. kneedler.
have you said that before this minute?
doesn't  doesn't that get them at least to  through the motion to dismiss, and doesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?
i don't how 
with respect to whether the presidential determination is authorized, any  that matter will be resolved in subsequent state court litigation. any responsible state attorney 
by our public records request, yes. if  if your honor is asking if i spoke to the 
i think that would be a valid argument if we were attempting to raise an equal protection claim here, mr. chief justice. that's not what we're doing. what we're saying, we are making an argument based on what the state supreme court held, namely that this is a violation of the  the union's right to engage in political speech, and this is one of the reasons for it. granted, that particular justification for the ruling was not argued below, but this is not like we were attempting to argue equal protection, a totally new basis.
not entirely because both in the opening and in closing, the lawyer said to the jury, he did it, but i want you to know from my very opening that this case is about life or death, and that's the ultimate decision you will have to make. he said that in his opening and he said it in his closing. it wasn't simply a case of saying, my client did and now the prosecutor is going to go through the motions. he told the jury, what i want you to focus on is the decision you're going to have to make whether, in the counsel's words, to spare his life.
but 
well, i guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.
was there a basis in the record for making that finding?
but, doesn't that approach  it doesn't make any sense, because you're only looking at half of the equation. presumably, if you have a special set of principles for governmental actors, they include immunities and defenses and all that. and you just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't want, i take it, the immunities and defenses that go along with it.
 in the government area, it happens 
so the rule you would have us follow does result in a  a super technicality in a sense of what  what was on the record at the time of the plea.
i don't think you need to make up 
fine, and then it doesn't go in that.
no, that is not our reading of the statute. the 
or is there any  is there any, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're talking about, smalis?
justice breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?
yes, i agree, your honor, that we could.
mr. clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.
does it matter exactly what the nature of the escape was? are we supposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough? well, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an hour. let's say he obeyed the speed limit. he just wasn't going to stop. does that make it a different case?
it's not 
they routinely 
well 
it might have been a  a means of warning congress off one area, but not the other. that is to say, just because we think there's a constitutional doubt here and therefore congress might be sailing close to the wind if they tried to overrule our opinion by statute doesn't mean that congress couldn't in this other area alter the result in zadvydas.
no, i 
i believe 
certainly here it would have been simpler had the trial court been a little wordier, and that's not the case. that said, i think the test should be, looking back, has the trial court done something that's reasonable. and then to get into the prejudice issue, i think you have to look at the facts of this case. in terms of whether or not the restraint could prejudice mr. deck, one thing to look at is the defense that he offered in mitigation. his defense in mitigation was not that he was not a dangerous individual. it was not that these murders were an aberration 
well, your position, i take it, is that if somehow we follow your suggestion so that the president's suggestion may be put into effect in the state courts, that there would still be a habeas jurisdiction, ultimately, over the result if you're dissatisfied with what happens in texas. do i understand you correctly?
well not, that's not quite correct, because the signals that the higher input prices show, yes, they do generally incent more production in a, in a typical market. here, however, where you have a product that takes 30 to 50 years time and production, the price, higher price signals when they are sent by a monopsonist, like weyerhaeuser in this case, actually send a very powerful message to tree farmers not to replant alder, despite those high prices. and there was evidence in the follow-on cases that reference that. it was alleged in our complaint in this case but not actually backed up by any testimony at trial, that tree farmers in oregon and washington were actually electing not to replant alder and as professor noel notes in his law review article in the issue of the antitrust law journal, which by the way is the only area  half of this issue is devoted to this subject. it's the sum total of literature devoted to predatory overbidding in this area. and what professor noel notes is that where you have localized monopsony, the result is when the monopsony is in full flower a misallocation of resources between regions. the highly productive forest lands of the pacific northwest won't have as much alder in the future because of the significant signals sent by a monopsonist, even when they are engaged in that scheme. the seller is happy if he has mature alder to sell at that time to get the good price, but he is not going to replant, because he sees that 30 years down the road he will not have a competitive marketplace within which to sell his timber, and that was the reality in this case.
the california supreme court said that the fourth amendment applied to these searches, but it only protected in a limited way, along the same lines as we said in griffin. and the standard they applied was, it protected against arbitrary or harassing or capricious searches 
yes.
mr. 
that is a respect for privacy.
i think  as i say, i think it's on face of the statute.
the right-of-way was for 30 years which was long than the 20-year easement that the government got in exchange. and this something that was negotiated at arm's length by parties that didn't have the acrimonious relationship that developed between respondent and the blm.
in 1982, justice ginsburg, my client reasonably presumed that the act of reentry, while itself a crime and while itself rendering him deportable, wouldn't categorically preclude him from seeking relief from deportation if, at a future date, he might become eligible to adjust in some way, either through suspension of deportation by having been here for 7 years, or by marrying an american citizen, or by having a reasonable claim for asylum. all of these were routes to stay, despite illegal entry or reentry.
well, why  why is that true? let's assume that they could establish that there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this  this tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to undermine and  and injure the competitor, and they show that this scheme began to work and that their reputation as a lower-cost competitor was  was well established. why  why isn't that enough?
and where is it? it's  it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in  in a court of appeals, the  certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists 
but it's not retroactive. but even prospectively, there will be situations where this precise issue will arise in the future. so there is reason for the court to go ahead and resolve this question that has so badly divided the courts. but, justice o'connor, to answer your first question, i would have  i would have thought the conclusion was exactly the opposite, that what  what  the statute says you don't have jurisdiction over civil actions over which you didn't have jurisdiction prior to 1990, but you do have jurisdiction over claims that then can be appended to those for which you have jurisdiction in 1990. so i would have thought the more sensible way, at least from my perspective, to read this case  to read this statute is to say, is this a claim that could have been brought in 1990? and the answer from zahn is absolutely no, it couldn't. and similarly with the  with the joinder cases. they could not have been brought 
if that were true, i mean, congress when they wrote the statute, and in 924(e)(2)(b)(ii), or (e)(2)(b)(ii)(1), they specifically enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that violence. so it has an element, use of or attempted use of, or threatened use of physical force. but under prong two, they specifically deleted that word "attempt".
no. only  the only requirement is that there be an allegation that it's in excess of diversity  the diversity amount.
not the $8 million or $9 million.
 assume, for a moment, that we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active inducement 
so does the  what is it  the unfair competition restatement?
that's correct. but the trial judge ruled, under mott, that he was precluded from considering all mental health evidence, all evidence of mental disease or defect, on the issue of mens rea. so, even though it was admitted, and there's no quarrel here that all of the evidence that we sought to present was admitted, it was not considered by the trial judge. he could not. because the mott rule itself is categorical. and i quote from the mott decision, as follows, "arizona does not allow evidence of a defendant's mental disorder, short of insanity, either as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea elements of a crime." that states "all evidence," and the trial judge understood it to mean that, and that's the way it is applied in 
i agree with you. why  why aren't they filing  why  why are they all filing so many, 36 percent filing in the wrong court? why is that?
that's correct. it  it is thought 
good. i would like that.
the 
that's true, but we are  we are engaging here in trying to tell the california state courts how to dispose of these cases, which i am really not sure is an appropriate thing for us to do. they're 
over here. (laughter.)
 can you collect  can a patentee collect license fees based on an  patent that has been determined to be invalid?
where is there a limit?
well, i think 
even though  you mean even though it says that the policy says you should be noticed and you're  it says, attached to the notice will be a copy of the  i'm sorry. i'm looking  am i looking at the wrong place?
they've held that in this case. we have a massachusetts decision. it's their law and under their law in massachusetts, the judge can revise it.
no, your honor, i don't believe that at all. and in fact, again, going back to some of the court's prior cases and the roth series of case law, if you look, for example, at logan versus simmerman brush, there was a good deal of discussion about whether there was a tort law remedy and, in fact, there was in that case.
would you have a different result if they were related? supposing the lawyer is a cousin of the client.
so you charge two counts for violating the same section?
i think the answer, justice ginsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte mcardle. what made ex parte mcardle so unique is, congress went after this court's appellate jurisdiction, and that alone. what congress has done here, which is not that unusual, and it's certainly happened several times since mcardle, is that the court has modified the jurisdiction of all the courts, and that has had the effect of eliminating jurisdiction in this court over a pending case.
i don't think that's right, your honor, and here's why. to  it's not just the absence of commercially significant noninfringing uses that demonstrates contributory infringement. i mean, you have to demonstrate that you're making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're doing so. the inventor, at the outset, is not in that position. they're not making a contribution with knowledge that they're doing so. do they have absolute certainty? no, they don't have absolute certainty.
i mean, i don't understand. is there any authority in the commerce cases for  an x, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other  now, congress' power does extend to the x if the state doesn't say something about the x. but if the state says something about the x, then congress' power does not extend to it. that's hard for me to accept, because i don't see  whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and i can't find any support at all for that in any case.
yes, you may, of course. mr. hungar.
if the parties have a concrete dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would affect their rights and obligations in the way that it would here  in other words, that money will no longer be due to the respondents if the patent's invalid 
absolutely. and the court made a similar point in southworth, where it specifically declined to impose, on the university, a requirement to make judgments that would enable people to opt out in particular cases. and we think that the problem here would be even greater. but they would be particularly great under respondents' proposal that individuals who don't want to pay, without even having to express an objection, because the whole system would collapse. this is a classic collective-action, free-rider problem.
well, i think what i was talking about, the public-private distinction, it is different in kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct, some kinds of government conduct that are permissible like a subsidy, for example, take your south-central timber versus wunnicke case. the court said in that opinion you can't impose contractually on the people who buy the timber the obligation to process it in the state; but what you can do is you can subsidize it, so they can't want to do it. so this is something that has 
i mean, my goodness, all it requires  look, the problem is not a technical problem. it's a human problem. a judge is a human being. he gets the petition. there are 28 different issues. that's a lot of work. he goes down one, two, three, four. he gets to this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and what it says is, there should have been a lesser-included offense instruction and it cites three mississippi cases, which in turn cite one other case, and that  that other case says that the mississippi rule has constitutional implications and cites beck. well, i mean, if that's supposed to be sufficient, i as a judge would have to, in every one of these cases that's cited in these 28 different issues, start looking up the other cases in mississippi to see if there's some other place they cite some other case that says something about a federal case. i mean, you see it's impossible.
mr. landau, i'd like to know how you read section 2. what  what meaning do you give to a written provision in a contract?
i see.
well, certainly to  i mean, that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion requirement, the court would have to find that the  the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in the csra.
that's correct, justice stevens.
and in all of those questions, you'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out whether it was timely or not.
justice breyer, i wish we were talking about just a few rare cases because i think if we were, there would be, the statute would be amenable to not being applied in those rare cases. but this is one thing that i think my colleagues on the other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure in rare cases. they think it's a safer procedure every single time. and that's why doctors like dr. chasen and dr. frederickson try to do the d&x procedure every single time, and they don't do it because they are indifferent to health, i suppose. in their best judgment they think that's the better way to go. and it's just a question ultimately of whether you're going to defer to individual doctors' judgments, even when it's very much of a minority judgment; i mean anything you want to say about this procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the orthodoxy. most ob-gyns are going to do the d&e procedure, not the d&x procedure. even in the nebraska case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the intact removal, so i think that just gives you, just a, know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure. and so the question is when you have a perfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors who like to do is it a different way, can congress countermand the doctors' judgment or do the doctors get the final word?
but, your honor 
has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable.
let's say he's being held because the government insists that it's not retroactive and the government is then proven wrong. would that let him qualify under (2) because then the  the impediment to making the motion was the fact that he thought it was not retroactive, but then  and that was government action because that's what you insisted on. but then that's removed. so does  so would  does entitlement under (2) apply?
under the majority's opinion  now, you're dead right about what justice blackmun said, but 
but you are.
oh, i do too. i don't have any trouble with the distinction.
i  i don't make much of it. the parties here and  and the parties in the west fully understood for 20 years, after allen orchards, that the farmers were intended third party beneficiaries. that's  we settled in 1986 with that understanding, and this parade of horribles just has not come to pass.
a person just says, i was  i was on, you know, pcp or whatever and  and i couldn't form the requisite intent.
because of the error in scoring?
well, in this particular case, they found that the facts that we alleged did not give rise to a right to compensation under state law. and this court in williamson said once you've been denied compensation in state court, once it's certain that the state courts will not provide you relief under state law, you have a ripe federal takings claim. at that point, the federal courts must be able to look at the factual questions underpinning the federal takings analysis, so that the questions of whether in fact this law substantially advances a legitimate government interest or it interferes unduly with the reasonable investment-backed expectations under penn central, which requires a detailed ad hoc factual analysis, that that must be done by the federal courts and cannot be precluded by a state court determination that is not considering the federal questions at the time or  and it cannot even under this court's decision in williamson county  cannot consider the federal question that's at issue. the  the city  the city contends that  that a decision in our favor would result in 
thank you, mr. salmons. mr. moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.
60 percent of an award by statute goes to a crime victims fund of the state of oregon and as soon as the judgment is rendered then the state becomes a judgment creditor. official
which  which brief 
your honor, mr. olson did collect, under the state workers' compensation statute, from the mine operator, that is correct, as did mr. vargas. and, in fact, the state of arizona was sued  the state mine inspector  alleging that they were negligent, and that case was resolved. that  a point of interest in that case is that in that case, the state  because arizona is a pure comparative-negligence state  alleged that the federal mine inspector was partially at fault and that, therefore, mr. olson and mr. vargas' damages should be reduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond the motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as is common, that the federal government would have identified the state of arizona and the mine operator to be non-parties at fault, as well, so that those individuals  the negligence of those individuals would reduce the plaintiff's damages against the federal government.
that's in  you may be right on that, but that's not what  what we're here for.
that is one way of approaching the case, but i think under aedpa, what you'd look at, which would be the more appropriate way, is how the california supreme court analyzed the claim and not first conduct a de novo review about whether there was a reasonable likelihood. i don't think that in the end that there's much difference 
no, but we haven't had this problem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the most efficient answer to the problem that we've got? in other words, isn't it time to do something different?
oh, i agree with you. but the act that involved  the act that constitutes the  that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. i'm trying to help you here. i mean 
that  that seems to me an  13 an extraordinary non sequitur. i don't understand. they 14 didn't want to deal with it because they thought he was 15 innocent. i  how does that make any sense?
in other words 
you really think it has to trace the molecules.
well, if you  if you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with the same identical background and everything else, one judge says, i think military service should be taken into account, so i'm going to depart from the guidelines by 3 years. the judge next door says, i don't think it should be taken into account so i'm going to impose the guideline sentence. both cases are appealed. they're consolidated for argument. what is the court of appeals supposed to do? uphold both of them?
 "for that claim" 
okay. it's like a lawyer knows what to say and knows what not to say. this has been established for years. you cannot say in the securities business, your honor  and we don't know this; we know what to do as lawyers. you cannot say it's a quid pro quo, i'm going to negotiate with you how much you have to purchase. that type of conduct created pools during the 1920s and the early 30s which manipulated prices to unsustainable levels that led to the great stock market crash and maybe the depression. the legislative history said: we want to stop pools. in section 982 of the securities and exchange act it says, quote, "one person or more cannot work together to raise prices." we allege that the first part of this horizontal conspiracy, across underwriters and across ipos, was to require the laddering in order to raise prices.
yes, that's inducement.
it would, well, it would be a horrible 
thank you. the case is submitted.
 stage one. then the defendant has to come up with a nondiscriminatory reason, and then you find out if that was pretext. you kept saying in your brief what you said a moment ago that you have never seen a case. you said it never happens. it never happens that the prosecutor stands silent. so this is a hypothetical, academic question. but i think you're being pressed to say, well, suppose it does happen, and i take it that your answer is in that case the person who's raising the batson challenge wins. but you're  you're not willing to say certainly. i mean, you seem to say  well, why are you uncertain?
okay, but you're one step ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, in effect, any exposure. here there isn't any certain default on the note. so far as we know, here, there may never be any default on the workers comp obligation. so that your contingency is a much more remote contingency. why should that, why should this case fall into the same category as the promissory note?
 go along with you when you force this terminology on me, whether congress intended it to be retroactive. as i see it, the issue is whether congress intended it to apply to reentries that occurred before iirira was enacted. i would not consider that retroactive, but it's still an open question what congress intended.
 go through 
we think none, because the trial court did not focus on the proper analysis. the trial court focused on a causal connection analysis that this court has 
least 
well, but wait a minute. you  it was suggested that the state could require a license of an out-of-state supplier, and that that license could be conditioned upon submission to michigan's jurisdiction in all respects. is that not feasible?
 direction on the terminology.
the charge itself is one of conspiracy. joint enterprise is, itself, not an independent charge in international tribunals; so you can charge, for example, murder. and your theory, in an international tribunal, of how you get to murder is joint criminal enterprise. but you'd have to charge the underlying violation, itself. here 
why don't you let the guy go?
and by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?
that was their decision to trust us with that, and ironically under the government's theory of this case, the does 
and when they have  they believe they identified such children, and they request the parents to subject them to the evaluation  congress placed on the school districts to at least conduct an evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree 
 and i make all the relevant payments to that state, but they distribute, don't i get a piece of paper saying i did it?
well, the problem is that some lower courts have held that if you  you file a motion that's untimely 
not in my view. and i think on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on. it's not a fact that the government 
no, but it seems to me  and i think what bothers me is  is what bothers justice kennedy. it seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that justice ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten  that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. and that, it seems to me, is  is something that we  we are not here to touch. that's a question of california law. what we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here  that we have a question about the  the breadth of the case we took. but maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. but i  i think we're not here to decide whether california could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. do you agree with that?
 the validity is the  is the nub of the provision.
mr. eastman, would you comment on the extent of deference that we should give to the court of appeals' interpretation of colorado while in view of what we said in bishop against wood?
you acknowledge the existence of things called commissions. or don't you?
what do you  excuse me. what  what do you make of  of this argument? let's start with the premise that congress wasn't thinking about overt acts at all. start with the premise that you argue from that what congress was concerned with here was primarily penalty. however, congress did this in a context in which there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized kinds of  of conspiracy formulations. and if one has the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got to prove an overt act. in the other variety, there's no reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't have to prove overt acts. why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to say, look, when there are recognized models and congress, in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going to get into the question of did congress really mean to make a change when it picked one model rather than the other? it simply picked one model, and the  the clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law is to apply the model. if it didn't talk about overt act, there's no overt act requirement. why isn't that a sensible way to  to work our way through these thickets?
but the problem is, justice souter, we would then have an issue of michigan law inserted as to whether 
we did file an ineffective assistance claim in the state habeas petition.
and what's the evidence that there is a virginia resident, in there?
but where does it set forth agreement?
your honor, the  the deprivation is  is perhaps marginally greater, but i would suggest that it is marginal, and therefore 
may i ask this question, mr. lobel? putting aside for a second which policy we look at and so forth, were there findings that particular inmates were improperly sent to this facility?
the government  is the government of the united states somewhat behind the state of california? it's not efficient in  as efficient as california in supervising its parolees? because you don't have this rule.
but the electorate will know that this issue is presented to them in connection with this senator and that your organization has linked the two very clearly.
even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge. district judges make mistakes.
well, what am i supposed to do with the case? i read them quickly. i don't necessarily pick up everything. i'll read them again. but if i don't find empirical verification for that statement, what am i supposed to do with this case?
 the state's sovereignty.
you're saying  you're saying that a state cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.
that's correct, your honor, no crime, and the reason for that  i'll go one step further  is because there's no way of knowing whether the government 
language in the statute but not in the conference report.
maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. were you taking core samples?
they were.
oh, i understand your point.
 would be an easy defense.
well, he also raised an  an entirely different claim, didn't he? i mean, it goes to ultimately the same point, but he raised the claim that the court had not engaged in an adequate colloquy 
i think that that's an extraordinary position you're taking.
yes, it can be looked at 
all right, if that's 
what does the term "micro color" describe?
what do you mean? it's a separate 
why? one, he didn't  let's assume arguendo that he received the death sentence. he had an opportunity 
well, it doesn't eliminate it completely, justice o'connor. the class action fairness act only applies to claims where there are plaintiffs who exceed the number of 100, plaintiffs over 100, and  and the $5 million amount-in-controversy 
and you didn't sue b.
but as far as the actual client, you moved to dismiss. so that's why there's no  was no back-development. you moved to dismiss. therefore, you have to assume whatever facts 
it is the case that in extreme cases, for example, the beneficiary has collected the medical benefits, does have some leverage over the plan, and in fact, the plan  and  and can say, well, i'm not going to bring the claim, i'm not going to, you know, do what i can to collect the money unless we come to some kind of agreement. and in fact, the plan in this case provides  that says, the company's share of recovery will not be reduced because your  you have not received the full damages claimed, unless the company agrees in writing to a reduction. and they leave it open there, in appropriate cases, for the parties to negotiate that. but there was no bar in equity for an equitable court to enforce an equitable lien that arose out of a contract where that satisfied the  the standards for an equitable lien.
but on the other hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do if you're applying a new decision that's that been made retroactive. so i would have thought that meant you can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't apply.
well, this, of course, was a police officer, not a parole officer.
i recommend that. (laughter.)
 any case 
846, yes, in title 21. petitioners also argue that because prior to enactment of section 1956(h), the government had to prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under section 371, that this court should presume that congress intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense. but this court looks, first, to the text of the statute to discern congress' intent, and had congress wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement, it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h) on the language from 371 or on the language from any of the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that contained express overt act requirements. congress chose a different model, the drug conspiracy statute, which as i said before, this court held in shabani does not contain an overt act requirement. by choosing that model, congress manifested its intent not to require proof of an overt act because at the time it  because at the time it acted, the background rule of statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring would be construed to follow the common law. petitioners point to silence in the legislative history, but the silence in the legislative history on the overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling evidence of  of contrary intent that would justify departing from the text of the statute and this court's bright line rule. finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy statute at issue here. that venue provision reflects congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in which money laundering cases can be brought. it does not reflect an intent to redefine the  the elements of the substantive money laundering conspiracy offense.
 the average public, you had a constitutional right? i mean, you might have. i might be surprised. but, interesting.
isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? i mean, that  that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.
no, the burden's not on the state to disprove it, justice 
pardon me? pardon me, justice?
 state decides that, what's unreasonable about it? "they're" 
the government's position is that it would depend on whether the defendant could satisfy the high standards required for mandamus. and certainly if the government believed that the disqualification was 
 congress addressed the  only part of  of the problem. but as justice stevens recognized, plaintiffs would want to sue the solvent defendant, and that's why the  making the government itself subject to suit was part of the deal. and  and congress understood that plaintiffs were going to take up that option. and that's why, up until the  this court's adoption of bivens, there were virtually no decisions about 2676 because plaintiffs just didn't try. this court in gilman, an early case relating to 2676, recognizes that  that the statutory provision was intended to address precisely these types of concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns that have led this court and congress in other contexts to recognize other forms of  of official immunity. and this one is equally subject to immediate review. respondents suggest, considering for a moment, what congress would have expected in 1946 when it initially enacted this, and  and i think that that is helpful. there is  it is quite clear 2676 is explicit, that congress did not expect the end of the litigation against the united states under the ftca to mark the beginning of the litigation against the employee in his personal suit. and  and respondents offer the example of the postal carrier as one of those quintessential cases that congress meant to address. but, of course, the postal exception to the ftca, another exception in 2680, 2680(b), would bar many claims against the united states relating to a postal carrier's misdirection of the mail. now, respondents would have the court believe that if that suit was brought against the united states and the united states was found not to be liable because of that exception, that the plaintiffs were free  and congress intended that the plaintiff be free  to then go sue the poor mail carrier himself personally.
i think i said it when i said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under pittsburgh press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. and that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, justice breyer. we know that. and the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from mr. cochran.
yes, but justice stevens' question is you buy the ticket in liverpool. is the ada  an  an american buys the ticket in liverpool to come to the united states.
but it begins with the exception as provided in subparagraph (c).
the utah supreme court seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the utah protection against the  the counterpart to the fourth amendment. they seemed to suggest that their own constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy of the home. was there a reason why you argued only the u.s. constitution and not the state constitution?
well 
justice breyer, i think that the 
so how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?
 that one is kind of a lesser included.
so why couldn't they say, the date on which the right asserted was newly recognized by the supreme court if it has been made retroactively applicable? wouldn't that have been a more 
were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers? if state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were  they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the fair labor standards act.
no. but in fact, this was a  the search warrant was for two premises. he was picked up at his mother's house. and in fact, officer muehler had  was  was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was 
and even if it was  and i would  can point this out by an example that gets to what justice breyer was saying  if a person is squeezing a lemon  and this is a common example in law school  and it turns out to be his sister  he knows, in the abstract, that a person  killing a person is right or wrong. he knows it's wrong. but he does not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong. in this case, if eric clark's evidence showed that he believed the police officer was an alien, and there was substantial evidence in the record to that effect  and i would specifically point you to page 39 in the joint appendix, where the  where the expert testified that eric had a heightened fear of police 
 the state's proof, as i understand what the arizona law is.
would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the protestant version of the ten commandments?
yes, but you're asking us now to  the  the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. it was mere opinion. i really don't see how that's included in the question presented.
there are situations where it would be broader than 703. 704 would be broader. an example. if a ceo of a company came up to an african american male and punched him because he's black, that would not rise to the level of a hostile work environment under your test. it wouldn't alter that individual's terms and conditions of employment. however, if the ceo came up to an individual who had filed a charge of discrimination  of discrimination, and said, i don't like you filing charges of discrimination, and pushed that individual, that would have the effect of impeding individuals from complaining. and that's  that's a situation that's different because congress anticipated that  that retaliation is only as varied as the human imagination. congress could have easily 
 may i ask you this question? the warrant now says it is now  the warrant says the contraband and so forth is now concealed on the person or in the house. and if i understand your position correctly, your first argument is it should have said, will be concealed upon the happening of the anticipatory event. that would have  and describe the event properly. that would have satisfied the ninth circuit's objection.
is targeted enough? i mean, i'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in general. is a claim of discrimination  i don't know the state of the law, but maybe if a minority shareholder  a minority person is the sole shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't. but here, i take it that the corporation jwm brought an action and won or settled for $45,000. so they're out of it. now we're just thinking about the sole shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's another action here. and as to the two most plausible ones that i would like to assert an action as a third party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that you've conceded you have no right there. and as to the other one, which might be protected in many cases, that the  knowing that what was going to happen, they deliberately interfered with the contractual relation between me and the corporation. that's what we're asking about now. and you say, well, i didn't raise that. now, is there a reason you should be given an opportunity to raise it?
could they? because i thought this court had held that  that you can't bring a 1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the conviction.
no. (laughter.)
thank you. mr. hoffman.
the reason one does not use legislative history, if one does not use it, as i don't  as i don't, is not because congress doesn't expect it to be used, but because congress does not have the power to delegate to one of its committees the content of  of its statutes. the constitution provides that legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by the president, and the problem with legislative history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is this amounts to a delegation by congress. it's not a matter of what congress expected. i don't care what congress expected. it can't do it. it can't leave it to a  to a committee to  to fill in the blanks in a statute. that's the problem, and that has nothing to do with expectations.
well, what, what reason would congress have for wanting a system that says  and there are many, many, many people in the united states who would like to sue pakistan. they would like to sue china. they would like to sue russia. there are all kinds of places they would like to sue. and why would congress want to have a system that says to those countries, you can come into federal court and get your claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, china a; but by the way, if the federal judge makes a mistake, there you are in mississippi, alabama, illinois, any one of 50 different states? in front of juries, the very thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have to do. now what would their theory be?
we  we don't need a presumption here. i mean, the  the only basis for inquiring into severability is the presumed unconstitutionality of the statute. i mean, that's the only basis why severability comes up. we don't have to presume anything.
well, am i wrong? i thought that the attorney general of guam did file cert in some cases that are pending, or am i wrong on that?
yes. our position is that when you read the venue 
the most suspicious thing in the complaint that i could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000. then you date that with in or about early '01. now, i think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to march or april of '01, you would have said so.
 said they did not cure because they didn't do any of a, b 
i'd like to also point out factually that in the  in the  initially in the petition, the  and actually at trial and at the mississippi supreme court, they talked about that the defendant may have been able  may have been out there selling drugs to the defendant. i'd submit to the court that a proper review of the record, if you look at the mississippi supreme court opinion at page 98 and  97 and 98 and page 40, the defendant in his own brief admits that that was not in evidence. it came from the  from a plea where the  where one of the co-defendants pled, and it never was placed before the jury. here in  in the brief in this particular case, they talk about, well, he  maybe he was borrowing money, the sting question, whether he was borrowing money. that comment came from one of the witnesses named powell who was merely speculating. i don't know what he was talking about a sting, but it could have been that he was going to borrow money or  or rob somebody. so that  that was speculation. so the  the facts just don't support the granting of a lesser-included offense in this particular case. i'd also like to ask the court to  to note that in hopkins v. reeves in footnote 7, the  the court suggests that we don't decide that  that particular case based upon the bifurcation issue alone. i would ask that the court answer that question in this particular case and state that beck has no application in this particular case because the danger that occurred and the court's concern with in beck is not  doesn't happen here in the mississippi instance because in jackson v. state, we had already said that you have a bifurcated hearing 
of course, there can be ten commandments or any religious works as part of a museum setting. this isn't a museum setting, your honor. every monument on the texas 
i've been asked to couple so many things together, i may forget some of the coupling. please  i mean this in seriousness. please remind me because there is a very good answer in law and on the record to each of your points.
yes.
and where in this record do i find that the state carried that burden 
that's true. it does apply to state prisons, as well, justice ginsburg. however, we  you know, we obviously can't be sure that it's always going to cover every state prison. it hasn't, at times, in the past. it might not, at times, in the future. i think, you know, one of the significant aspects of the rehabilitation act is  and i think the amicus brief filed on behalf of mr. goodman by the former president george h. w. bush really emphasizes this  the ada was passed based on a firm conclusion by congress that the rehabilitation act had failed, that it hadn't worked. and i think the record of constitutional violations here shows that, that we have such an extensive record of judicially confirmed, judicially established findings of constitutional violations in the prison context, and we have constitutional rights that impose on states the same kinds of requirements, not in all particulars, but in very similar ways, as the ada does, itself. i think that's where  that's where the congruence and proportionality really comes in.
general cruz, none of this went on in the opinion and there were four judges of that court who said there's a procedural bar here, end of case. the majority never explained why they weren't going along with that. i didn't see anything in the majority opinion that said, well, never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're going to deal with the federal question.
or what happened? what actually happened in that case, do you know?
what about major tributaries?
 a rehearing 
not necessarily, justice scalia, but it's important to focus on what this case is about.
okay, but aren't we in, sort of, the converse situation here? there isn't any question about the admissibility of evidence that shouldn't otherwise have come in. i thought your argument here is: the error proceeds from the fact that, by using this label  by referring to the circumstance as a "special circumstance," having been found at the eligibility stage  that circumstance, and all the evidence that might support it, is given extra weight, and that's where the thumb on the scale comes. isn't that your point here?
yes, your honor, it could have been brought as a habeas action. if you look at the nature of their complaints, they're  they're clearly in custody. habeas would require custody and violation of the constitution of the united states.
i still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.
 says the legislature.
it could be on the hard drive.
but  but why isn't the younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem in craig against boren? it took one class of litigants unavailable but then allowed the third party to have standing. why  why aren't  aren't your opponents here just like the bartenders in craig against boren?
several reasons, your honor. it's not  it's not a close question whether this court under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial matter would impose a per se rule in this context. there is economic  there is consensus among the respected economists 
justice o'connor 
six.
well, and again, mr. chief justice, though, i mean, fair enough, but i think you also have to keep in mind that this is a context where this filibuster issue isn't some idiosyncratic interest of the appellant here. this is an issue that was identified as a campaign issue by the  by  by the candidates opposing senator feingold, by the wisconsin republican party, and by appellant's own pac. and to the extent you're trying to figure out whether this was really designed to influence the pending legislative votes or the election, the timing of this ad strongly suggests it was designed to influence the election.
well, their  the interest they claim that of supervising their employees.
that is, justice souter.
mincey v. arizona.
yes. and garner, this court's decision in garner and this court's decision in brower, which was written by justice scalia, basically to quote brower in both cases. in the brower versus county of inyo 
 the defendant thinks he will be badgered and badgered until he finally talks.
that's correct. you'll  you'll just get another hearing. but an important note on that: you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing sooner than the state has decided that you should get a hearing.
this is from appendix page 81 and 83. this is a report that starts with the term jurisdictional at the top.
in this case it was legally sufficient and i point out that this court very recently has issued a decision in the first case of the term, ayers vs. belmontes, where you looked at the question of the catch-all mitigation factor in california in the penalty phase of a capital murder case. and you looked at the instruction and interpreted it in terms of the closing arguments, the evidence and the other instructions as a whole.
only peripherally. is that an issue for us to decide in this case?
 there wouldn't have been a settlement first without taking care of the second, if they had known both were on the table. but you say the first had been  both of them had been 
no, i don't think davis was taking the position 
yes.
no.
the union can make it as difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out. they can send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.
what  what do you mean that national banking associations are, after all, corporations? i thought they were distinct entities from corporations.
our two cases did not  did not raise that issue. the issue was not decided in those cases, was it?
no.
can  can i ask you? you say counsel proposed some alternatives to  to the visible shackling. did counsel object that there shouldn't have been any shackling at all?
 seems to 
absolutely. and the difficult questions about the constitutional authority for the executive determination may come back to this court, but they're not presented by the case right now before the court. the most direct avenue, i would submit, for this court is to resolve this decision by affirming the fifth circuit judgement, and by affirming it on the grounds that a coa could not issue because this was not a constitutional claim. and that would necessarily entail affirming breard to the extent that breard noted that a subsequently enacted statute, the aedpa, to the extent of a conflict, superceded the vienna convention.
they 
well, as a practical matter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon as the employer has a sense that the employee is on to something. he doesn't have a full knowledge of what the employee knows and certainly doesn't know that the employee might have told the government and that the government is investigating. and that's the purpose of the under seal requirement of the false claims act, to allow the government to conduct a full investigation of the claim, talk to other employees about what was going on. sometimes the employee really has identified fraud, but may only have identified a portion of the larger scheme of fraud that's going on. and the government gets to investigate that while the claim is under seal. but in the course of discovery in any wrongful termination suit or retaliation suit, all of that information would become available to the employer. and so the sealed provisions of the fca would be defeated in large extent. there's also the fact of just the litigation efficiencies of litigating the two claims together.
very well, mr. layton. mr. waxman, we'll hear from you.
and i'm asking are there  are there severe costs with that when there's been no trial?
can you make an ends of justice finding for all time? could he start at the beginning, any continuance i grant is granted after my weighing the different factors set forth in the statute and it's in the ends of justice?
so, you think the alj  or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the state to go first  the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?
 that the state 
but if we just had the moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshiping the lord.
yes?
and, of course, we take the 
you don't have boyle for that.
right. well, what if i think that the constitution provides that all questions of federal law  statutory, treaty, constitutional  are to be decided, ultimately, by the supreme court of the united states. can a treaty give that away?
that's a different question.
because i think unlike neder this case involves a jury  or excuse me  the  a  the wrong entity has determined the defendant's guilt not on the crime at issue 
to that extent the two cases were the same because in newlon there were no objections either.
but  but that's not the primary purpose of  of the ship, just as the primary purpose of this scow is  of  of this dredge is not transportation.
i  i would want to know more about the system because i think strictly if there's nothing else and there's no flexibility, i think it presents narrow tailoring problems.
well, the issue that is not subject to further review for purposes of jurisdiction is the attorney general's certification that the employee was acting within scope. the statute doesn't provide that the attorney general's certification that it is a civil action is conclusive but only the attorney general's certification that the employee was acting within scope is conclusive for purposes of removal. that's the essential element of the federal defense and that's what satisfies article iii jurisdiction. and in fact, this court in the willingham case recognized that an employee could assert a claim of federal immunity even though he was also at official the same time denying that he caused any harm to the plaintiff.
to be clear  and  and i want to be clear about his allegation is  because he does not speak english  that the interpreter told him this, and this was not during a plea colloquy. this was during discussions between the lawyer and the client through an interpreter in advance of the plea itself. and so his allegation has consistently been that that's what the interpreter told him his lawyer said.
 what i'm  what i'm  what i'm getting at is, i don't  i  as i understand the kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in favor of the death penalty.
justice scalia 
 in some respects, if you're talking about job-required speech that you are  part of those duties, and the function, is to keep it internally until at least there's some decision by the supervisor, and, rather than do that, you send it to the press or leak that information out, i think a governmental disruption in efficiency can be presumed there. so, i don't think it's as  i don't think it's as clear that that  that mr. ceballos would have ultimately prevailed under the balancing. i mean, if he had taken the 
well, your honor, with respect, i would have no opinion on that question. (laughter.)
 "never had a" 
well, but  but i take it the state has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.
suppose the person is convicted.
but  but your test is  is that the judge under california law is required to find that there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable likelihood, but he must do that without hearing the prosecutor's reasons. that's your position. right?
what this court said in flanagan is that if the defendant, at the end of the day  and if was the operative word  could obtain automatic reversal, then the defendant's interests could be vindicated at the end of trial. and if, alternatively, the defendant had to establish prejudice, then the interlocutory appeal would fail the requirement that the issue be totally separate from the merits, and therefore, there was no collateral order appeal. and flanagan didn't address this issue, but in addressing it, i suggest that this court should look at the way that it has protected other criminal defendants' rights under the sixth amendment.
all right. given what you're saying  and i  you're not accepting this i think, and i  well, there is language in this act which maintains in the united states title to the park.
well, the testimony is clear. 14 counsel knew about the abuse denial dynamic and they did 15 follow up on it by hiring three experts who were charged 16 to ferret this out. and it would do constitutional harm 17 to say, notwithstanding the fact that you did that, you 18 still have to go to records because as strickland 19 recognizes, counsel, even where you have diligent, devoted 20 counsel, as here, have to make decisions about resource 21 and time allocation.
 facts of  sorry.
that may be, but is it not  is it not clear that this is one of the factors that was used to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge, just as the beard and the other things that are mentioned in the  in the manual were?
we think that's a separate section.
well, what i would say, justice stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of war. at times, there are obviously united states sources that are relevant to that. obviously, if you have a field manual or something that says specifically that certain offenses are triable under the law of war, that would be very instructive in the tribunals. in certain situations that i don't think are principally relevant here, you might also have war courts that were set up to deal with municipal offenses. but that's not what we have. and then, they would look to u.s. law.
well, they say 
the  whether it remains on the record, anything that remains on his record is obviously much more 
whatever the merit of that statement, that is not what these counties have said. what these counties have said in their resolutions is that the ten commandments are the precedent legal code of kentucky and the central historic legal document of the state. what they have said in this display itself, in the explanation of the display, that they are the moral background of the declaration of independence, to the exclusion of all others, in effect. when you say the, it doesn't say one of. it says it is the foundation of our legal system. it doesn't say it had an influence on some of our laws. it asserts the primacy, the actual text of this display asserts the primacy of the ten commandments.
your honor, two matters on that. again, the proof of innocence does not have to be absolute. this court stated in schlup that the fact that there is still some evidence of guilt or that there still exists even substantial evidence of guilt does not prevent a defendant from passing through the schlup gateway. the second matter and one which i think is important is that as a matter of tennessee law, a circumstantial evidence case requires not only that the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. so even if a jury could conclude that the blood came during  that the blood got on the jeans during the course of the crime, it would also have to be able  it would also have to be probable that the same jury would also conclude that it was an impossibility for mr. blake  dr. blake's testimony to be correct. so, in fact, it's dr. blake's testimony which has to be impossible to  to accept in order for a jury to find 
it doesn't  so you're retracting that. you, i think, were asked but i'm  i'm not sure you fully answered. suppose the police, as atwater would allow, arrested, made a full arrest of caballes, and then they impound his car. in the place where they put it, couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
so your response is they should just grin and bear it. they 
mr. grant, could i come back for  i'm sorry. i have the wrong counsel. mr. hallward-driemeier 
well, it's 
no. there was 
thank you, mr. salmons. mr. vladeck.
the state 
i mean, if i know that what i'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me i am willfully violating the law.
like in yellowstone. there is a river i think. who owns that?
would  would you allow a trial judge to reopen  to  to permit the prosecution to reopen the case?
so we do have a fairly long discussion by the lower court on the infringement issue. in order to find infringement, they had to construe correlation.
well, i don't think that that's a reasonable inference, justice ginsburg. in fact, the ibla considered and rejected each of the alleged administrative actions on which his claim is now based.
well, there's really no  looking at the document, there's no way of telling that. that is correct. there's no way of telling that, and i believe that was probably the reasoning of the court that, you know, it took three days to get mail because you didn't get  it wasn't sent out last time, obviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he added the three days, and then you have the 14 days to, you know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get it to the court in this case. so 
let me try to answer that and 
a cure 
the single message is, "join the army."
the third party perpetrator that maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was hurtz or hearst?
well, that  that would be a  a tougher case for us because we would have an explicit ruling 
but  but we've held, at least under the m'naghten version of the defense, that the state  that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the m'naghten test.
mr. schaerr, who's going to be representing some states as amici, will presumably have better information on that subject.
except in this very case, one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith.
oh, no, your honor, they argued that before the 
the  in  in this situation, it's  it's the nature of what was said and his lack of presence in the courtroom where there was no affirmative defense. and in  in the record below where the florida supreme court sent it down to determine whether or not there was consent, there was no acquiescence. mr. nixon simply did nothing. when  when asked  when mr. corin testified and was asked about whether he discussed the trial strategy and whether mr. nixon agreed or disagreed, mr. nixon simply did nothing. he  he didn't acquiesce to the strategy.
the  yes, under eleventh circuit law, the magistrate said they should have counted that additional time at the end.
well, we  we 
the at&t patent 
you couldn't what? i didn't hear the last part of what you said. you just got to the point of 
so you think any regulation would conflict with the national bank status?
so your answer is yes?
but what do we do about that? no, you have no interest in answering my question, but the question, it seems to me under the law, here is what i do  and i'm a good deference lawyer, as you are. i simply look at the statute. and i imagine some very weird case that the statute could cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing. there's no possibility in the world that applied to my client. but most charges are simply stated in the wording of the statute. and most judgments simply say guilty. so i say "see, you see, it is theoretically possible." and now when you decide what really happened, court, you're supposed to look only to the charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it didn't. so the whole congressional scheme is basically put to the side. now what's the answer to that problem, insofar as you want to answer it?
what  i don't understand what difference that makes. i mean, in both cases there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee. it was a promise. and when the money was collected, the court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien upon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.
you denied it. then they presented evidence, and their evidence was a, b, c, d, e. and i guess then you presented some contrary evidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he wasn't an employer. so i guess the odds are he was.
okay. so  so the mere fact that one is in investigating something doesn't make it a search. what does make it a search?
because that is  there must be facts to show what the overt act was. just providing a legal memorandum of what the elements of the offense are doesn't do any good. what the constitution contemplates is that the essential facts be laid out.
could the plaintiffs have filed a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the bypass procedure?
your honor, i simply observed that this court did not find it was bound by the california supreme court's finding that the bar association is a government agency, nor did it find in wisconsin v. mitchell that it was bound by the wisconsin supreme court in regards to its assessment of practical effects of the wisconsin statute at issue there.
well, part of the question whether the regulation goes too far is whether there is a basis for imposing the burden on a particular property right. here we have 
or i suppose if future dangerousness was a specific aggravating factor under state law, as it is in texas, for example 
remote, remote, remote economic effect.
yes.
well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims. so the district court or the sixth circuit has just said, we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation, which takes this out of the normal rule 8 type of case.
but that assumes that the company in effect says, we have a pay structure and our pay structure as it is now treats people differently depending on sex, race, or whatever. and that's not the kind  that's something very different from the ripple effect argument.
you have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the  as pleaded in the complaint. another point i'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title vii. the other side wants you to look very closely at title vii when you're  whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title vii and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. and i didn't  i'll have to confess i didn't hear much during the first argument. i had my head in my own book, but what i did hear is justice souter referring to the  the  an instance in which congress has a choice of two models for  for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow congress to make that choice. that's what happened here.
but is that the current ins 
in norton versus utah wilderness alliance, having to do with the regulation of off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its action.
 doesn't have 
does anybody give it to us?
you're too hungry, mr. estrada.
generally speaking, it's a matter of state law with some limitations.
well, you  you have to assume not only that the victim is unwilling or reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or not, could be subpoenaed. isn't that right?
isn't it clear that it would have been the last choice of the congress?
yes, but it's a very serious allegation for somebody who's in the position that this employee was to make against police officers. and as i understood the case, the supervisor said, "wow, i don't want loose cannons around down there who are accusing perfectly honest and respectable police officers of violating the law." now, that 
no. no, your honor. of course with that explanation, i do not.
of course, i dissented in that case. so i'm not saying this was a good idea. (laughter.)
yes.
would it always, then, be surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus fact? because otherwise  i mean, what i'm getting at is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating an element of the offense, and as i understand it, under california law, the element of the offense couldn't satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the higher range.
no, but how  how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would  would be placed in  in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns? i mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as i know. and yet, congress dealt with it.
there are some  at least it's arguable that there's federal municipal taxpayer standing. and certainly some states have said that there is. and that  and whatever ohio might or might not do is not relevant to this proceeding. we don't know that. i'm  you've given your opinion on what it would be.
well, they are two very different schemes, your honor, and one is for the situation that petitioner faces, which is a third party whose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of another, and it has its own venue provisions, its own jurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of limitations. importantly, however 
but you're using 
well, in cases where the  where the only claim is against aiders and abetters, those parties would be  would be out of court; or, likewise, cases where parties could not satisfy the scienter requirement, those parties would be out of court. so, congress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies for certain categories of claims, and that was part of the point of the act, as the conference committee report makes clear.
oh, yes, your honor. there are circumstances in which these peptides could be used as research tools to stunt the growth of blood vessels and study what happens next with other compounds, but they were emphatically not used as research tools in this case. in this case, they were the objects of study, and integra won a jury verdict based upon that presentation. and, in fact, never argued to any court or to the jury that there is a resource tool carve out. so, i was just talking about the subjective purpose earlier, and it is  again, it's important to note that the information can be used for other purposes. there's nothing in the statute that prohibits that. now, let me turn, just briefly then, to what is often one of the most important questions in these fda exemption cases, which is the timeline question. at what point in the arc of drug development is it unreasonable for a jury to conclude that the fda is an inappropriate audience for the next set of experiments? our position  and people may differ, as a matter of law, as to whether it is earlier  but our argument is, at a bare minimum, at the point in time at which a drug developer has a known structure and cures a disease in an animal with that known structure, all eyes turn to drug development; which is to say, all eyes turn to the fda. as a matter of law, everything after that, so long as it's relevant to the fda, is fda  is appropriate to view as fda directed.
why can't we say that speech that is  is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? and just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. not all speech, but only when speech is being used to  to extort money.
and so we're focusing on the message and that's the whole crux of the case.
regardless of how they would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the immunity question, our series of questions is why do we draw or why should we draw a distinction between immunity and federal bench trial? and your answer is, i take it, immunity is dispositive; federal bench tribal is not?
so, if 
isn't it true that the provision i referred to refers to the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party? so it's definitely referring to expenses incurred by the  by the plaintiff. isn't that true?
but, mr. frey, let me ask you a question. suppose this was a criminal case and the defendant was being punished for crime a and the judge in working out the sentence realizes he also committed crimes b, c, d, and e. he could take those into account in determining the extent of the sentence given for crime a. why isn't that similar?
that's correct. but i believe that it is not part of the test. it was that the branding language, as in justice brennan's  in justice brennan's dissent was not part of the text articulated by 
not when  not  not when the settlement, as here, involves the complete claim. there's never been a claim by the beneficiaries here that there's something left under state law to do or something left in the well to go get on the part of the state. but let  if i  i think it's important to understand why these suits against the  or a state could decide  and the anti-lien decision does not compel the state to decide otherwise. a state, with its discretion under medicaid, could decide that pursuing third parties is not viable. this is not an ordinary assignment. this is an assignment with strong duties of cooperation required on the part of the beneficiary. now, what does the lawsuit look like when the state goes, after the settlement, against the third party tortfeasor here? the state has no control of evidence. it has a pile of bills, none of the relevant evidence. at the point of this lawsuit, the beneficiary's interests are adverse to the state's. they're not in a cooperative mode. they're interested in 
 in exchange for services and you provide property?
i don't  i don't understand, mr. clement, how your second point strengthens your first point. that is to say, if we disagree with your first point, namely that the institutionalized persons provisions are consistent with the establishment clause, we think that they contradict the establishment clause, they couldn't possibly be saved by your second point. can you require as a  as a condition of  under the spending clause that a state violate the establishment clause?
let's 
i would say it sure is before the court, because what we are considering before the court is your objection to instruction 13. and you said it should use the words in whole or in part. and i have to admit, i don't know why it shouldn't. but i'll have to ask them that.
we don't have a weekend problem, do we?
105(a) is much more limited than that. it is only if you take the second clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been done, that it looks like an affirmative grant. it says: "no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action." that's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement that a particular party raise an issue. i  as a official source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a roving commission in equity, i think that's a mis-citation.
particularly if it is justice harlan you're quoting. (laughter.)
 because it's more 
that's very sad. (laughter.)
while you're talking about the way, let me ask a practical question. 35 years ago in swann, this court said that a school board, particularly an elected one  it didn't say that  "could well conclude that to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of negro to white students reflecting the proportion of the district as a whole." far more radical than anything that's at issue here. then it adds: "to do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities." that's what this court said 35 years ago. thousands of school districts across the country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration. you can answer this in the next case if you want. so think about it.
limitations period by statute or 10 they have a laches principle that would limit the ability.
so, you say yes, it is.
 i would say, your honor, for one thing, it fits squarely within the definition of information service, which says 
 do we have a record of what the state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees, indicating what it could not do effectively to out-of- staters? what do we have in the record?
 as a matter of fact.
pardon me?
no, your honor 
okay. what is the rule?
would that have been likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?
what does primacy have to do with it?
that's all i want 
we do not know. we do not 
suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator. would the special  pardon me. would the river master then proceed independently and we'd have two different recommendations?
i have to interrupt to say 
thank you, counsel. mr. heldman, you have four and a half minutes remaining.
well, i suppose the vermont courts could construe it more narrowly at some later point. i would hate to rest the opinion on that.
couldn't you simply assume that anything that is discharged into a tributary ultimately goes where the tributary goes? wouldn't it be enough to prove the discharge?
 scalia, that's correct, that the exception would bar suit against the government for any damage to the actual contents of the package, itself.
but the  i  you assume we got  there goes the  that  there goes any bright line administrable rule, i guess. [laughter.]
 not the regulatory matter. the statute.
it's second-best to the guy who wants somebody else.
it's conceivable that if that determination went to a  an element of, for example, a tort claim and that the person were not  were not seeking to take under the will, it is possible. this court's precedent doesn't address that precise question. the united states hasn't taken a position on whether or not bankruptcy jurisdiction, ala the logic in ankenbrandt, encompasses the narrow probate exception that we concede exists because it's not necessary to decide this case. the  the petitioner's claim is far beyond anything that the probate exception has ever applied to. the respondent suggests that states have an overriding interest in having one forum resolve all probate-related disputes. this court has repeatedly, for over 150 years, rejected that exact proposition  justice breyer, payne v. hook, hess v. reynolds, mcclellan v. carland, which this court cited last term in exxon mobil  and it was the basis of markham's reversal of the ninth circuit decision that the federal jurisdiction is not determined by the scope and extent of the state's decisions with respect to where to send its own citizens with respect to disputes that don't otherwise have a basis for federal jurisdiction. the only place in this 
well, you can't have it both ways.
the  about the character 
your honor, i would be surprised because here, if you look at these commandments, it's that god has claimed that he is the only god, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the lord and god in vain. requiring observing of the sabbath. this is god dictating to god's followers rules for behavior.
oh, the essential difference is that there are various equitable principles that were categorically applied to subrogation claims, including reimbursement versions of subrogation claims. and they could not be disclaimed or overridden by contract. the burden of the insurer was to establish that there was a double recovery. that's part of the claim. the burden of the insurer was to show that the defendant, the insured, was made whole.
you have a judgment.
your honor, this evidence, however compelling a picture it draws of past injustice, simply cannot trump the state court's finding of no purposeful discrimination. it does not address 
no, but that's not that issue. that is, i think the question is, why is it that this statute doesn't simply provide the following route? party a and party b enter into a settlement, and they say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and suffering. you, arkansas, are out $50,000. well, fine. you're in the case anyway. sue the defendant for the remaining $40,000.
he raised it in the first proceeding an ineffective 
only? only? only?
i understand that.
so we already know that  that that effort was made before he was tried in the guilt phase.
not in the venue part and  and certainly  because it does apply to which district court a case should be brought. i would say it  it's redundant to the extent of conferring jurisdiction to a federal court, but not on the venue provision 
no 
may i ask one other question about the proceedings in the trial court?
there is in this case  see if i understand you correctly.
justice scalia 
when it comes out, it just comes out in subtle ways as well as direct ways. now, do you agree with that? if they  if you do, it seems to me there's no case here.
justice kennedy, on this particular point, on conspiracy, yes, if  that you couldn't charge some other offense, like aiding and abetting, and transmute some conspiracy charge into that. rather, the international law and the laws of the united states recognize you can prosecute him for aiding and abetting as a violation of whatever the specific underlying crime is, like murder or attacking civilians. what you can't do is use the standalone offense of conspiracy. and here's why. because the standalone offense of conspiracy is rejected by international law, because it's too vague. and this court has said that the test for a violation of the laws of war is when universal agreement and practice make it a violation. the world rejects conspiracy, because if it's adopted it allows so many individuals to get swept up within its net. justice kennedy, aiding and abetting requires a much closer relationship between the conduct and the individual offender. conspiracy does not. and so, for example, under the government's theory, a little old lady in switzerland who donates money to al qaeda, and that turns out to be a front for terrorist acts and so on, might be swept up within this broad definition of conspiracy. and that's why international law has so rejected the concept of conspiracy.
 the water district bows out. it has settled its case. it's a mystery what it settled for. at least, i didn't see it in any of the briefs. why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?
well, it depends on  it depends on  on how the case was resolved.
ms. forsman, can i ask you a personal question? were you a moot court finalist? (laughter.)
well, in part because we  we're putting out a notice to the public that we're selling the property. so it serves two purposes. it notifies that there's a sale to take place. it also identifies the landowner, giving  or the property owner one more opportunity 
no. i understand that, but i mean, it's the way of visiting the park.
could they put him in a cage?
i thought that was our basis.
well, i think union is  it says union or group of individuals. i think union is something 
 where we left off. it seems to me there is something offensive about making a particular portion of the public pay for something that the government says.
yes.
it could be. it could be. but in the course of proving the aider and abettor guilty of the subsequent crime on this natural and probable consequences theory, there would have to be proof that bore upon the target crime to show what his intent was with respect to the target crime and also whether the subsequent crime was a foreseeable consequence of the initial crime.
but then you're left with this question justice scalia raised. if it's ambiguous, an employee says i did everything within the scope of my employment, i did nothing improper. they allege i did something improper. i didn't. i was a faithful servant. the negligent employee will be allowed the federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful employee has to be in the state court. does that make any sense? official
i would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness. some of the amici take that position, do they not?
 or not?
what's  what's worrying me on this is  i'll tell you my concern without the hypothetical. crawford wrenches the confrontation clause free of the hearsay rule, and therefore, testimony  it might be testimonial even though it is not hearsay or falls within an  doesn't fall within an exception. you understand what i'm saying. fine. now, you come along with a suggestion, and what struck me immediately was that, wait a minute, can't i easily think  apparently not easily  can't i easily think of instances where it would be testimonial but it isn't an accusation made to a policeman. and conversely, can't i easily think  not easily  of instances where, well, it would have come in, but it was statements made to a policeman maybe years before, maybe about this, maybe about that? maybe it's a hospital record. maybe it's a business record. there are all kinds of exceptions to the hearsay rule, and they don't run parallel to the test you've just given. that's what's worrying me. what's the test?
it is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that epa has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer. in fact, the director of the psd program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.
 under this statute, where congress wrote the word "pending." and i wouldn't have thought they did have in mind a 
yes, but redeliver  you have to be there to sign for it again.
but that might well determine whether the research was relatively directly related. i mean, if i were a juror, i would  i would say it's relatively directly related if it relates to that particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not relatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying to found out which compound to submit.
i  i think so. i don't  i'm not aware of any criterion by which  substantive criterion by which the comptroller limits where a national banking association could designate its main office to be.
that is correct.
how many  how many circuits are applying that rule?
well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected.
let me tell you, what's aberrant is the california interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do. and if california has, some california courts have come up with weird notions of that, i don't know that that destroys the uniformity among the states.
oh yes.
 which is 
absolutely right.
thank you, mr. friedman. mr. staver, you have about three minutes left.
i think you can draw that 
 consideration.
yes.
 charge murder and  and the prosecution 
i think if you build into the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was done in a way that made it express that the teachers were going to be moved, that you were basically going to have five and five, you were going to have a quota at the two schools on the basis of race, i would say that that would be unconstitutional. i would think, though, that there are many ways you can accomplish similar objectives without making it so explicit. and i do think that in this context, i mean, there is an independent constitutional value in not having these kind of express racial classifications drawn.
okay. so we're not paying for this, you pay for it. is that right?
that's absolutely correct. but the chief justice was asking me about the municipal property taxpayers with respect to the claim concerning the property tax exemption. those plaintiffs  respondents are still in the case. that's not kim's auto.
well, if  if he did, he's only strengthened our case. what i want to say to the court is  is that both of those provisions are modified by the phrase, because of age. this court in hazen paper construed the because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent and said statistical correlations with age are not sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning of section 4(a)(1). and the presumption of uniform usage  we're entitled to point to it as well that the presumption of uniform usage which would be that the phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age. and the reason why title vii is different than the age act  i keep coming back to this because this is so critical, justice breyer  is that the premise of the court's statistical cases under title vii is that it's  it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability between the races and the genders, whereas you know and i know that there is a difference in an  an inherent correlation between abilities and skills, between people of different ages statistically. and so that whereas in the  in the race and sex context, a statistical disparity by itself points out that there's something suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the burden on those occasions which would happen. and by definition, i think you and i both think, justice breyer, that it's not all that often that you're going to have these statistical disparities in the race and sex context. in the age context, they happen all the time. so it's  it  there's no basis for suggesting that a statistical correlation by itself creates something suspect, and it would rob the notion of a prima facie case of any meaning to say that  that a statistical correlation with age, which we expect to see all the time, would establish a prima facie wrong. and, of course, the secretary of labor wrote a report telling congress that race and sex were different than age for this very reason.
that's correct.
since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different?
i don't want to cut your answer but i want to know whether there is anything specifically in the record in your case that bears on my question.
it  it would depend on the nature of the restraints, but if the restraints are not visible 
uh-huh.
oh, i  i think mr. jefferson thought that. i think many of the founders thought that they were leading the world, and i have no objection to us leading the world, but mr. jefferson's lead of the world was through the legislature not through the courts.
no, but if you're looking at 
your honor  yes, essentially.
is part of the dynamic here, mr. perry, that if this goes back to the state court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation because you now have a class action that has to proceed, and that a large part of the litigation strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so that congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and in the federal courts?
it is the  it is that, "i am having to pay the royalties  that i say i did not agree to pay, because this is an invalid patent." money is being paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of money. that is a major injury.
was the court then 
right. and between the  between the time of petition at the meeting of creditors which was approximately six  six weeks later, he became employed. as i say, he had a mortgage. he had children to whom he has to pay child support. at the time he had a wife he owed a lot of money to. he was concerned about having employment so he could in fact meet those obligations.
no.
so you're saying the 
so city of kenosha was just kind of a silly waste of time.
no, your honor, it can't post the ten commandments by itself in its legislative halls because that would then be the government endorsing expression for support for that message. it cannot be, your honor, that just because there is a legislative prayer, that any religious message anywhere on government property would then be permissible. as justice kennedy has said in his opinion for 
i'm looking at page  -
well, pennsylvania actually does that and certainly did it at the time mr. pace was litigating.
if congress meant to reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why didn't it put that in? it was expanding the categories and it included failure to state a claim, which had not been there before, and it included if you sue somebody who has got immunity. but it didn't include exhaustion, so why should we read that in?
miss olivieri, you also rely on the "no action shall be brought" language to justify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even though only some of them have not been exhausted. do you have any, even a single example of the many other instances where that language is used in the federal statutes? and there are many of them. do you know any other case where it's been interpreted that way, so that claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained, but rather the whole action will be dismissed?
but may i 
the point that justice stevens made 
justice scalia, i think, although it's an interesting digression about whether the government is being candid, the objection here has nothing to do with that.
is it being interfered with?
i mean, that's another court, and  and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in federal court.
it would presumably, though, be limited in some ways. for example, if the application for state post-conviction relief raised arguments under state law, those would not be a proper subject of a petition for certiorari.
well, maybe that's the act, but when they put it in the constitution, why didn't they adopt the language, "to the same extent and in the same manner"?
 may i ask this question? that's a very  that's a very interesting statutory construction case, i must say, by the way. but the  in 1996, when they made the offset available against social security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of limitations; they changed subsection, i think, (b) to (d) and said the 10-year provision is retained. and when the 10-year provision was first put in  i mean, when the exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a statute that had a 10-year period for everything except student loan recovery. and it seems to me that if you look at the 1996 statute as saying, "we're going to allow offsets against social security," under the same scheme that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the 10-year provision to preserve it  they preserved the 10- year provision  that they seem to me to be preserving it in a statute that made this distinction between student loans and all other offsets. is 
the effect of such discrimination is that his next-door rival, in effect, "got the sale." do you want to say that isn't enough?
well, but in the case before us, the court  the kansas court said  i think it's 24 or 25 of the  of the headnote  we are reconsidering the issue.
thank you, mr. kester.
no, he thinks 
general clement 
okay.
yes, that's required by washington law. the jury 
but  but why  is that true in every case? i mean, take the timid person who's not sure  i know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's  let's assume the timid person is not sure. so he wants  he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. he  and he would take an injunction. that's certainly much easier than going to jail.
your honor, as i read the garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a definition of deadly force because shooting someone in the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly force. the circuit courts  i can tell you that the circuit courts in the wake of garner have said that garner did not create a test and have created different tests along the lines of the model penal code to reach that definition. but the point  i was going to say a point that i would like to make is that there are degrees even within the continuum that might be within a definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks, using a firearm. those have different degrees of potential lethality, so even if they are all considered deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to make.
it's  it's not, your honor.
why is he bringing his damage action? he thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me. now, how did it hurt me? it hurt me because i went right to prison.
i  the 
your honor, we believe that it should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the guam supreme court opinion stands, and we prevail under that ruling, the guam supreme court's interpretation of section 11 of the organic act.
well, more than that, and this is why the physical presence is important and why the internet hypothetical that your honor raised would not  would not satisfy the state's concerns. what the state can do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count whether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match the records. that's the best way to detect whether or not there is evasion. because if you have 
exactly. i thought you were equating the two together.
thank you, mr. clement. the case is submitted.
in that case, you then rely on the february 27 date in the order? then it must be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27? in such a case it would be okay.
yes.
i'm sorry, counsel. maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?
and  and let me make  make it easy for you. do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the united states based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the united states has  on which the united states has agreed to be sued? is  is there any such case?
 in this case.
well, i think that the same logic would apply as in 
have they issued any rules or regulations on this  on this point?
i think you quoted from 4(a).
but the reason you often need qualification is there's  there's sort of a basic question, does this include state courts as well as  as well as federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other. but i don't  i'm not aware of any precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces foreign courts.
no. i've asked a lot of questions. go on.
typically i think the 
because there, that's  there, you  you  there's a separate enterprise basically selling id cards, and that's not part of mohawk's business. but if you're just hiring them the way you hire other employees, illegally as it's alleged, that's mohawk's enterprise if there's some separate illegal activity?
that's 
because, number one, first, let's eliminate the 21 states that do not have political party registration. they would not  in fact, the  the problem that we're worried about here, draining, and  and the problem is going to happen simply because people in those states, like president bush's texas, are free from election to election to go to any primary they want to 
no, not that. the same program, but you just have a little tag on the ad.
i thought that that's what the government was getting at in the passage i read earlier where they don't make it  there must be a statement by the issuer of the correction. they have more leeway. but you  the ninth circuit  the litany that it's using, the  the set of cases  for example, plaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock than it was worth. the  the notion that's repeated, that your loss is established on the day you purchase the price, that's just wrong, and i think we would have to at a minimum say that.
i think what the court would have  the appellate court would have to do is evaluate all of that through the prism of 3553(a). is the sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction that the court below could have imposed. and if not, for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to the district court.
counsel, i would have thought your  your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the petitioner has to come up with this  an alternative is that otherwise it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method. and that if it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be brought under habeas. if it's just a challenge to the method, it can be brought under 1983. if he's unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it starts to look like a challenge to the execution that has to be brought under habeas.
i don't believe that congress, when it used the word costs, was adverting to section 1920. if that is your question, i do not believe that that is 
yes, it does because it  it goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct. but if those findings of fact are simply the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of the  the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.
but that can be changed at the whim of the legislature without any accountability to the voters because at the same time that they change the tax rate and not alter any tax liability.
mr. frederick, can i ask you a question?
it is still on the books?
mr. bedrick, in your brief you were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressing this question. you said it's just like you go through the same litany as title vii, that is, the plaintiff meets a burden which is in title vii very easy to meet 
well, justice ginsburg, i certainly think that petitioner will be up there arguing that eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those arguments will be made. without respect to that, certainly the arguments about article 21 and article 36, that are very much the centerpiece of their argument here today, would also be available to the d.c. circuit. and if there's some constitutional requirement that that review be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that seems like something that can better be adjudicated in the context of a concrete case at the point that that review is sought.
well, i don't think it's necessary, if the court doesn't want to address whether the government always needs to  or the courts always need to find a private person. the good 
well, there isn't any one correct sentence usually.
but the difference is that one of those petitions could be totally dismissed and the other one would not be. if there were no exhaustion whatsoever, they  they'd plainly dismiss the federal case.
that's absolutely correct, your honor. the court never invoked subsection (b) as authority for exaction. after  when the petition for  for rehearing was denied, the 7-day period in subsection (b) then came into play. the petitioner, or the  the petitioner below, mr. thompson, filed a motion to withhold the matter, stay the mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari, and that was 
now, in that case, are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor was insolvent? and we're assuming insolvency in the hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.
you do 
right.
now, that doesn't fit into your in rem theory, but why wouldn't you have been able to recover that on a waiver theory? if you  and i understand your waiver argument is, you can defend the judgment on the ground not  you know, any ground to uphold the judgment is okay for the respondent. but why wouldn't you have tried to defend that part of your case on the waiver theory?
he  he sent the 
just 
okay.
it  it depends. the districts were drawn such that the democrats who were running were incumbency. and the reality of congressional elections is that incumbency is a tremendous advantage, and in the face of incumbency 
well  well, do you think just as an empirical matter that in most cases where there's known to be guns plus drugs, the police will enter without knocking?
no. actually there doesn't, your honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal property  then you skip down, about halfway down  shall be transferred and conveyed to the state of alaska by the appropriate federal agency. so it is  so this is complete in terms of 
 that there's an 
that is correct.
but as mr. kaplan pointed out, all  the fact that something is a vessel doesn't mean there's jones act coverage, and i think mr. kaplan was getting to the perils of the sea. someone who's working on a boat that is not in the water day in and day out is never exposed to the perils of the sea.
that's true.
it's necessarily determined on the  any search has to be decided  the reasonableness of any search has to be decided on a case-by-case basis.
no, i  i mean, i thought  there are two parts to this. question one is, can you possibly get a judgment  what used to be called a jnov or a jmol or whatever  from the court of appeals, when you didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in, in the district court?
well, i don't think it actually  i mean, in  i think they're about equal, aren't they, in respect to language? and the argument against the other one is that prisoners are going to get mixed up about it. they  they don't know exactly what they're supposed to put. the argument against the one i proposed is it adds complexity of decision-making. sort of between the two, it's rather hard to see.
okay, but we still don't know what you're excluding. i mean, the missouri is a tributary of the mississippi, but i assume it's still covered.
but the chief's point is that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being more than 90 days because then you would have, in addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert petition, the time it takes for this court to dispose of the petition, and the statute of limitations would be tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed 90 days.
no, my point is i don't believe this is really a deterrence argument. deterrence is not a substitute for moral culpability. we allow the deterrent function of the death penalty as a justification for it, but you couldn't give the death penalty to somebody who didn't deserve it under the state's scheme, in order to further deterrence.
yes. the difference between acquiescence and  and potentially sandbagging.
if  if you otherwise demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political motivation a defense?
mr. gordon, isn't it the case that once you've achieved unitary status, which means that the effects of past intentional discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you can lose unitary status is to discriminate intentionally? isn't that right?
generally, no. there might be  there might be an occasional example where it may have been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but generally speaking no. the money laundering conspiracy prosecutions were done under 1956(h).
i'm certain that there are business regulatory crimes throughout the world.
mr. chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a california appellate court. surely they know california law better than we do.
the  but this was not an uncabined search. that's my problem. what you're  what you're  the bottom, you're saying to us, is that it's not unreasonable  an unreasonable search if she went upstairs and brought the straw down, right?
what if the dogs get a little more sophisticated in the future and can also smell a certain kind of perfume, something like that? would then the whole analysis change?
so we have to figure out in every case whether the two claims are interwoven. do you think  do you think counsel for the defense isn't always going to say that they're interwoven?
why do you have to do that? why do you have to do it first? it says you can take into account this  extent to which the program reflects additional costs in particular districts.
yes.
now, was there a finding of 90 percent?
mr. stone did not testify at trial.
well, they're not going to run into an exhaustion requirement, your honor, because if they've already been through one round of state post-conviction review, then they are unlikely to be able to exhaust more claims because there's a  there's a 
i'm sorry, your honor?
what's the difference?
if that started happening, i think you, in this court, would do nothing. i think that congress would see what was going on, and they'd amend the statute, because that's clearly not what they intended. but that's not this case.
no, mr. chief justice. working together is what this guy tried to do at the beginning. he said, i'm happy to negotiate.
but he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start.
but that is the issue in front of you, i believe.
 c, d, e, or f.
but the judge presided over the jury trial, and the judge could identify if there were four acts of violence and threats of violence to obstruct interstate commerce.
doesn't it have to go to both? because i mean, he's saying look, first i want to show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence that was not proffered, that i didn't have in mind, that i wouldn't have objected to. and he then wants to proceed with respect to his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't look to. there's a dual purpose, i thought.
i guess it's true, is it  i'm testing my own understanding of this  that if, in fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, if you had a state and that state gave a state law remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail or something, then that state law remedy would continue in existence because the thing in the law that sets aside that state court remedy is a different part of the same chapter 
no. i have no problem with any of that. if the regulations are ambiguous, take into account the statutory text, structure, policies. what the court below did, of course, was say it doesn't matter what the regulations say, these have to be the same. it forgot that in fact, these regulations were very different. the d.c. circuit said there's no statutory mandate of identity and that the  and, of course, respondent was there in the d.c. circuit. it was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence, as the court called it, between nsps regulations and psd. and the court said 
he would have to say i have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim. he has to at least assert i have a claim.
are you talking  because i think that makes a difference for the reason that once you talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the united states where the costs would be very high probably to change the ship and the benefit to americans would be tiny. all right. so i  i want to know what you're talking about.
yes, but that's under a chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to jurisdiction.
that's correct, your honor. there is no exception to that. the  the statute itself is structured in such a way that its jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the relationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate.
may i ask 
that case is engert, which is 
it  yes, your honor, it does.
i'm not sure i 
do we owe any degree of deference to the comptroller's interpretation of the provision?
well, i suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there. that's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't it? and it has to be apportioned among the states. and you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the year.
well, justice scalia 
well, what is it?
justice o'connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display. you in your concurring opinion in the pinette case made the point that in the context of accommodations, the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot of sense and you urged the court to drop it in that context. i think so too in the acknowledgment context. certainly if you have a situation where you don't have  i think in the acknowledgment context as well, a focus on purpose may not be that productive. but i would like to talk about the purpose 
if we  we altered that rule, it would make more sense.
then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about. i take it there is no way really for a ship to  they either have the right door or they don't have the right door. and we're interested in the set of cases in which they're going to have to change their doors. and what i came in here thinking was we're talking about ships that pick up people and sail in florida and sail around the caribbean. that's the  now, i've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. we are talking about ships like i'm the last human being alive that went on a swiss ship to europe. okay? (laughter.)
that is correct.
it always benefits the state of california.
there was a challenge filed to the probate of the will originally by the  the brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually yes, our client did join that some years later after it was first filed. so that would have been an alternative.
i'm not asking 
except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though.
well, abused  a court always abuses its discretion if it  if it commits a legal error. so, that is basically our position here.
no, no, it's the 
you don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence. it seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part. if you can reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction 13?
well, then the question would be is there some federal law reason why they have to. i mean, they may under state law have to apply them 
 petition?
why would she bring it then? they gave her a big raise that year.
it's  the virginia courts don't paginate the record 
your honor, that is mostly correct. there is also a family that joined the parents association back in 2000 that has a child in seventh grade, that will be approaching high school by the time this court decides the case.
and now suppose it's exactly the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to the employee if he gets sick. in your view, that's not covered.
might be.
justice breyer, this is not jerrold electronics. there's no indication that in this case there was any price discount given on the printheads in order to make it up through a supracompetitive royalty payment extracted from the end users by requiring them to pay three times the market for ink. the end users are charged three times what independent ink would sell them the ink for directly. and  and the original equipment manufacturers, the printers who put the trident printhead into the printer to sell to the end users like general mills and gallo wines  they're charged twice the price. so there is a markup on the ink. this is a case in which a supracompetitive profit is being extracted as a kind of royalty on the ink sales for life.
so, they were  they were directed to take into  they "shall" take into account an invalid factor.
or they only relate it back to the day of the conviction?
that's correct.
it does if we're bound by the determination of avena. it does if i have to believe that individual rights were created here, without reexamining the question on my own.
yes, but what if you had the same result but  in terms of the sharing of the expense and the recovery, but it was computed on an hourly basis rather than a percentage basis? would that produce a different result?
in your view, were it not for the statute, the federal statute, your view of the attorney general's authority is  leaving that statute aside, if it weren't there  the attorney general, should we have an attorney general who is opposed to the death penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop federal  state death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages in that.
it doesn't mean it isn't present isn't quite the same thing, is it?
oh, not at all. i mean, i can't see how, how respondents could argue that 
no, your honor. it was  what they relied upon was what was  what was detailed in sims, which was 6 years ago. but with the  with the discretion that florida department of corrections has and that they've exhibited in the past, that they've utilized that discretion whenever we were having the electric chair litigation going on, we can't presume that. the added problem is 
but the objectives of sentencing are not what's involved in this case.
i think they would have. i think that  i don't concede that there was really a need to, but i think they would have because they would have said it's 
justice ginsburg, there was an indictment that canada issued against the petitioners. it has charges under  for smuggling, under canadian law, which is customs act, section 159. it charges unlawful possession of imported spirits under excise act 163(1)(b), disposing of goods illegally imported, in violation of customs act, section 155. so canada has its own process. there has  there has not been, to my knowledge, any request by canada for extradition, but the treaty between the united states and canada does include revenue violations, and 
 we now get a case where it's 3 years.
 it was your honor.
the motion to reverse that was heard by a state court judge was not run  that hearing was not run by ceballos. it was run by the defense lawyers in that case. and ceballos's testimony was limited by the prosecution's own objection. so, you can't judge anything from how that disposition came out, whether the state court judge thought it was  the police had lied or not lied. and you can't judge anything by the way that hearing was conducted. but i want to return to why it's so important that the court not shrink first amendment activity in the workplace. it is of the utmost importance that public employees, who internally report matters of public concern, enjoy first amendment protection, and for two basic reasons. first, the public needs to have a government of public servants who do their jobs honestly and with integrity, and not yes-men afraid to tell public officials the bad news. a per se exclusion of first amendment protection creates a powerful disincentive for deliberation within government. the last time, i cited an example of a fema employee who was punished for saying to a supervisor that fema wasn't ready to handle the next hurricane. but the facts of this case are just as compelling, denying a first amendment protection for prosecutors who expose police misconduct. and his disposition memo wasn't just a prediction about whether  how a judge would rule on a motion; he exposed police misconduct and it 
yes. three counters. they sell perfume.
 i thought 
yes.
mr. mertz.
how do you  how do you define a tributary?
 the attorney general had not adopted this interpretation, it may be that this congress would have passed those initiatives 
no, the issue is reserved. the motion has been ruled upon. the judge says, "no, i'm not going to grant this motion before submitting the issue to the jury." that's the end of the motion. the issue isn't over with, because it can be raised again after the verdict. isn't that what the rule provides?
okay.
there is a provision of title vii that limits back pay to at most 2 years.
it does refer to the transfer before. but what follows here, refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within that  that main clause. it's obvious they don't because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. what we're talking about here  wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands. they're not used solely for  for the purpose of conservation. the purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the state would need to enforce alaska game laws. that was the point of  of that first provision. but secretary chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those  those facilities and equipment that are used by a state in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the united states.
very well, general bennett. we'll hear next from mr. kneedler.
and that's not  that's not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by expanding the collateral order doctrine.
you should have written a better contract.
well, isn't that the  isn't that the essential difference between the structure in this case and the structure in the case in which the government comes out, saying, "this is your government, saying, 'don't smoke.'"
 yes, but 
well, my 
well, i'm not sure at that point that they've entered into an agreement to share the risks and loss  of profit and loss from the assets that they're putting together. i mean, this court's decision in maricopa county says that that's the critical test.
which you decline to specify. right?
but your answer, i take it, assumes that the framers had no concern with the capacity of the court to test the  the validity or the truth of the statement.
well, your honor, the total  the total figure is 146.5 million. it is a drop in the bucket compared to the 11.4 billion that congress appropriates. moreover, your honor 
no. i just would like an answer to my question.
justice scalia, there  there are two things which come into the  into the court's analysis. first is the court is correct. the burden is quite high, and it's  it's high for a reason. it's justifiably high. we don't shrink from that burden, your honor. what we say is that along with that burden, the court also requires that the entirety of the evidence be reviewed. if the entirety of the evidence is reviewed and the effect of the entirety of the evidence on a properly instructed, reasonable juror  that's the nature of the  the determination  what effect will that have? when we look at the facts in this case, when we look at the blood evidence in this case, yes, we don't deny that there is evidence which could support conviction. however, that is not the test in schlup. schlup specifically rejected that inquiry.
well 
first of all, your honor, i would suggest that it is not we who would close the doors of federal court. it is, by definition in these cases, the congress that has closed the doors of 
thank you, mr. phillips. ms. perry?
he's convicted. and i think you're going  your position is that conviction would stand.
justice kennedy, the caveat is that 17 the court instructed the jury that the arguments of 18 counsel are not evidence and that the law would come from 19 the court. and in that context, how much weight did they 20 give on the passing reference in ms. dantos' closing 21 argument? you don't have to reach that issue in this case 22 because we know what the jury was concerned about. they 23 were concerned about parole and they were concerned about 24 that because the prosecutor 
yes, i know they did offer, but nobody did it.
are you telling me that the committee reports are  are binding law?
in other words, is it preclusive of everything else? that's what i'm getting at.
but even burglary i think in most states would be clear.
bit is that also your theory?
your honor, of course the bond issuance here also goes to the guam legislature and they are held accountable for that in the political arena. i would suggest, your honor, the question about  i agree with petitioner's counsel about the certainty of determining some of this historical material is difficult and not precise. but we have gone back and looked at the contemporaneous statutes in each of these territorial jurisdictions, and as mr. waxman pointed out, puerto rico it turns out actually uses the actual value, all of them use the actual value.
that's correct. and the  the thing that's on the disk in the foreign 
so in assessing the reasonableness of the california supreme court's decision, how could we say federal law was clearly established when other courts considering our precedent have gone the other way?
therefore, can we consider them?
that's right, they don't say  i mean, they exclude, for example, the canine cases, where you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before you show up at work. so 
absolutely, your honor. and, in this case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know, andersen retained its work papers, and the work papers were extremely extensive, and they were required to fully document the audit. the only things that were thrown away were notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been incorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the work papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this case, is that there were some documents that were destroyed. they were precisely the kinds of documents that document-retention policies are designed to eliminate, in part  for a variety of reasons, but, in part, because they are preliminary in character and they can be misconstrued. for instance, your honor, the fbi agents, generally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their notes of interviews. they take those notes, they make a file memorandum, they throw away the notes. why do they do that? of course they know the defendant would love to have those notes when it comes time for a trial. they do it because they feel that they have written it up in an accurate way, and enough's enough. that's what we're talking about here, your honor. and there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would have put andersen on notice that its document-retention policy was  well, in fact, the government doesn't say its document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a crime. instead, the crime was when david duncan asked his secretary to throw away documents that he could have thrown away, lawfully, himself. this statute does not give fair warning that that 
it didn't specifically refer to the residual category. but even in shepard 
back on your earlier part of your answer to justice scalia, that it's inherently prejudicial in the sentencing stage, if one of us were to agree or the whole court, the majority, were to agree with your position and write the opinion out, what would we cite for that, other  other than our  our own assumptions as to how the system worked, judicial notice?
there  there is in the legislative history. that is, the legislative history describes the coverage of the term enterprise as encompassing any associative group. now, we don't contend from that stray reference that congress specifically had in mind alliances between corporations and specifically intended to include them. what we do contend is that that legislative history is inconsistent with the hypothesis that congress anticipated the problem of alliances of corporations and carefully 
that could not  that's not prohibited under the controlled 
that seems to be your position. i mean, i don't think merrell dow necessarily had that effect.
your honor, the problem is the eight claims that he is now exhausting in state court, if the state's approach is taken, he forever sacrifices, loses the right to federal review of those eight claims.
so, why wouldn't that apply?
thank you, counsel. ms. blatt.
ms. maynard, before you start, maybe you could answer the question i tried to ask at the end of his argument. where in the record is the report?
 sale from the manufacturer to the dealer.
well, suppose, mr. chemerinsky, it was like moses on that frieze where there are commandments showing, but there are only the sixth through tenth commandment. would that be all right?
you're saying the federal court makes a decision which is not binding in the case. that decision can be undone by the state court.
i think that's correct.
may i  may i ask you 
it is?
he tried to do that.
and they are often anticipatory. they aren't issued because the suspect is now using the phone, but because it's anticipated in the future the suspect will use the phone at some point and there's probable cause to believe, if  if the suspect does, there may be evidence of a crime. i mean, anticipatory warrants are just inherent in the system. i don't  i just don't think your argument follows from precedent.
but i thought the idea of moore was, if you're using this, the doctor is prescribing the drug as a pusher.
no.
why should it make that suggestion? it would certainly not be in the interest of the united states.
would i make the same analysis?
mr. salmons, i  i  you've cited the  the baylin case to me and i  i've looked at the description of it in the brief, which i had recalled, and what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking by the state, and when the state didn't offer what baylin thought was  was enough, he went to court, he prevailed, and recovered a much larger sum than the state had offered him. his legal fees were, by the irs, subtracted from the award, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by the legal fees. now, how do you explain that situation there?
 your honor, in 
 as a regulator, tend to give greater priority to power considerations, as opposed to local environmental concerns?
exactly.
yeah. all right. but i need an answer to it. [laughter.]
20  15 years after a case is tried 
well, they may not be able to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather than more dilation?
i have  just have one question. if we were to adopt the petitioner's first suggestion that we should simply have a strict reading of our mandate, would that cause problems, so far as people interpreting our precedent and indicating that, by implication, we've reached this hobbs act question?
yes, but her claim is assume it's been made irrevocable. i just want some money from this guy.
mr. clement, will you tell us how the government would come out applying the turner analysis in this case?
but as paragraph 51 of the complaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways even worse. because it specifically relies upon parallel action and alleged parallel inaction.
we do not believe that we have to have  that we have to disclose anything to the district court to have standing as does to seek a fair procedure within the cia. at the time of totten, the idea of having a doe being able to sue was not recognized for a plaintiff who wanted to protect his identity. we have that now as of the last 
but is there any average or any  is there  does the record tell us how  how long most of them have been there?
 but i believe all of those are statutory fees.
suppose  suppose the  it came up under the foreign sovereign immunities act. the district court judge remands the case. in his opinion romania is not a country. that's what he thinks. never heard of it. (laughter.)
then the district court was wrong too i guess because the district court made the same 
do we 
 another 
well, it  that's the way justice blackmun interpreted the majority, but the majority didn't quite say that because it said the burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient mitigation to justify something other than the death penalty. and conceivably one could have met that burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came out even.
but in this case, wasn't it true that the trial counsel knew about the vienna convention right and, for whatever reason, thought his client would not be aided by talking to the honduran counsel  consul.
 agreement.
we believe that as long as it is making a report to a third party, there ought not be a distinction. now, of course, you don't have to wrestle with that in this case because 
 that might not slide 
there is a distinction here. this young man had not been in school today, had not been an campus, was not in any class that was released to 
did this study show what future fleeing speeders would do? i mean, i will accept that for, for the sake of argument that  in fact, it's probably true. i would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore. but did this study show what the effect of a rule that says stop chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or fleeing anybody?
i see. and the other question: of the 13,000 grievances, how many did result in litigation?
now, i had always thought  and i think the courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of decisions  that the words "discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities" meant you can't discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price exists. that's what i thought it meant. and it seems to me that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that was the general understanding of the courts. and either it's not permissible to give such an interpretation  i don't know why it wouldn't be; it's literal  or there's a good policy reason for not doing it in respect to the policy. and in respect to the policy, what worries me about the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what volvo  forbidding volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here. if it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to compete better with other brands. and that means lower prices for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt. so, if i'm trying to read that law consistent with 60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust law, i guess i would  might favor your opponents in this. i'm exposing my entire line of thought. i'm trying to protect interbrand competition, why  while, at the same time, not being  not being unfair to the purposes of robinson-patman; and, therefore, i'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been read. so, what's your response?
 you put it 
that's absolutely right.
right, i  i 
right. so the threshold issue that is  that  upon which lopez and morrison terms  turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.
let's see what it is. the  the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised  whatever they were  the 1998 guidelines? and if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, i suppose, habeas would  would not have been a possible remedy. is  is  am i correct on those two points?
mr. fisher, remind me in bringing up the plea question. i thought one of the reasons why this defendant wanted this particular lawyer is that this lawyer made good bargains with the prosecutor. was that not so?
yes.
yes. and 
come  come back here. (laughter.)
that would be an erroneous instruction, i assume.
justice scalia, on page 5(a)  or, i'm sorry, on page 3(a) 
they have made the decision. they have made the decision that the aggravators are there and have not been outweighed. they have made that decision.
thereafter, all you have to do is cite the new york state statute, and you've raised a federal question.
okay. first of all, this is no patent troll. the founder of mercexchange really did invent this innovation. he really did, as the record clearly shows, spend years of effort trying to build the system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous licensor. he has  it has entered into licenses, which are all in the joint appendix, that are very specialized in terms. he was asked by ebay in 2000 to consider selling them. he offered to license them. the parties couldn't come to terms, and ebay then stole the technology. it willfully infringed it, knowing about it, having cited this as prior art, having had one patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265. and the common law and equitable principles have  are quite clear from story, pomeroy, all the way back, that when you  when you're talking about balancing private harms, which is what equity courts do  i'm not talking about the public interest, but i mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated, willful infringer  i mean, the jury found that it had no good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing or that the patent was invalid  you don't balance private harms. but let's take the case in which you don't have willfulness. it's not this case. let's take the case of somebody who doesn't try and, quote, practice the patent. that's not this case. let's take the case of somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way to exploit the patent is to license it. license  this  so far as i'm aware, this is the first case. the district court decision in this case is the first case in the context of a permanent injunction. and i'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to preserve the status quo are different. this is the first permanent injunction case i'm aware of that has ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it to others to make use of would in  somehow be costly or disable you from obtaining the relief that section 283 and the  and tradition provided. section  section 284, which is the damages provision, talks about remedies, remedies for infringement that has already occurred. the text of section 283 says  the other side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall. that's fine. but the purpose of it is to prevent. the operative word in 283 is to prevent. and unless there is an instance in which the patent has expired, the  the infringer is out of business and can show that it couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction issues to prevent further violation.
my  my question was directed to the first amendment.
and my answer is no, that we do not consider what  the death sentence. there's two. in bradshaw 
and you say the state has to show it wasn't the fruit. that would have the virtue of making the law quite consistent here, as it is with fourth amendment/fifth amendment cases. that's a well known concept.
i thought that's what you said in your argument when you started off.
well, your honor, i would urge you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it lists twenty other competitors that sell this very product, they have no cause to use that word. it is not used in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called "pigment," they're called "ink," they're not called "micro colors," that is my client's trademark.
i think  in general, i think that the terms of the plan, both under erisa law and under these traditional equitable principles that we've talked about or i mentioned just now, that the plan would likely be entitled to get  get up to the amount of the medical expenses 
which is consistent with his failure to argue it today.
so, that 
 when the appellate court is 
is it the president, and not congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal law, under which a person will be tried? isn't there a "separation of powers" problem there?
there was the appropriation.
 of the wrongful statement.
in what percentage would you say they have bifurcated or several jury trials? i mean, more than just one.
yes, i see it. you want to know somewhere in the sixth circuit opinion?
i don't think that that would be consistent with congress's intent. the  official in all of the government 
yes.
i believe that in circumstances where it is a substantial distraction 
i see your white light is on. i don't want to take  would the other states make that same answer that you just made?
but they are inherent. they are inherent. i mean, the point is that those past acts are what have developed your client's current clientele.
let's take 
it's certainly broader  it's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't it? because if the government  suit against the government is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, what would be res judicata is only the jurisdictional question, and  and this doesn't  this goes beyond that, doesn't it?
no. we're just trying to get at what mississippi law is, and i think you've 
i take it that what i've just said is of total irrelevance to everything. is  is that right? (laughter.)
that's partially correct, but significantly incorrect, your honor. the subcommittee specifically said zahn was wrong and wrote language to overrule zahn.
so if the defendant says, yes, i plead guilty to this crime and the crime is described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's  if that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, i did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than violate the statute.
i forget your position, if you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion that is predictable or that is likely is one of the elements that can be used to determine whether the use is a fair one? do you agree or disagree with that?
that's  that's if the court would allow the retroactivity decision to be made in the  on an initial motion by the district court in that particular case. am i correct? maybe i'm misunderstanding you, your honor.
 that would be binding 
justice scalia, we copied from texas on those special issues. and so, in the guilt phase, what you have to establish is the defendant acted intentionally. and that's what's required as far as a constitutional state of mind. and the deliberateness question is sort of an intentional-plus.
pardon me?
i would, i would respectfully disagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you will, your honor, in the sense that the application 
are you sure that it's as  as prejudicial in the  in the penalty phase as it is in the guilt phase? i mean, in the guilt phase, it does make the person look like a criminal. in the penalty phase, i  i'm really not sure if i  if i were a prosecutor whether i would prefer to have the defendant shackled or not. the issue before the jury is whether to leave this person in his  in his current incarcerated state for life or to execute him. and i  i might think that showing, you know, what  what kind of an existence it is to be  to be a life prisoner walking around with the legirons and chains  i'm not sure that that is going to cut in favor of the jury's giving the death penalty or  or to the contrary, make the juror think, boy, what a wretched life this is and  and that ought to be enough.
what is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a state?
oh, but i think that's the point, which is that is an important objective, but i have little doubt that that can be accomplished without the kind of five by five quotas.
may  may we just back up to the question  your answer to justice stevens? i thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages. i thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the united states.
i  i 
we can and will.
that's  that's right.
thank you, justice scalia.
is 
no, right. i think really the question is an x or not x question. it's does the plra as a matter of statutory law required individuals to be named in the underlying grievances, and the plra is entirely silent on that question, and this court's decision in sims v. apfel lends further lends further support to the proposition that a federal court cannot go beyond what the particular administrative agency's rules require. i realize that was a plurality decision but i think the petitioners win under either the plurality opinion or under justice o'connor's concurrence. and so yes, justice scalia we agree with you that it's simply an x or y question that down the road perhaps the court could address the scenario where a prison system amends its rules to require individual defendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner can't comply with that based on the short previous filing deadlines, and then there is a question of whether the administrative remedies were actually ever available to that particular prisoner.
mr. frederick, you mentioned cutting off a whole category of claims. and, earlier, you said they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a claim. but this is not a pass, because there are all sorts of remedies retained  derivative suits, 49-person actions, and so forth. and are you aware  you mentioned the 100 years of state precedent  is there any precedent in the state law for class actions for holder claims?
actually, no. those crimes, attempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's something about an attempted arson statute that has as an element or something that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, which at least in florida that's not the case.
that's not, if you read the affidavits carefully that is not an accurate characterization of  of any evidence put in by the petitioner. that was an argument 
well, when it comes to injunctive relief, the judge can hold a separate hearing, and that's exactly what happened here. and i believe the issue for the judge on remand would be, were there four acts of violence or threats of violence to obstruct interstate commerce? and i think the record clearly indicates there were. the judge said, here, "there is enough evidence, to fill this courtroom, of illegal acts by the respondents."
 in cases where there's direct review, but this is a different sort of animal that you have in california.
well, could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach? is there a nexus between what's in the presentence report and some other charging documents, or is it just in the presentencing report?
let me  let me raise the reality check question. if  if we assume that that is not the only possible reading of that statute, why in the world would congress have wanted to impose the  the system that follows from  from your result in which the  the national banks are  are excluded from diversity jurisdiction to a degree that the state banks clearly are not?
but i can say to you that with some degree, i think, of sound legal argument, that once 1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign immunity for third party refund actions in the context of a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign immunity for levies because there is no fundamental legal difference between the manner in which the money is extracted from the third party. there is no, the core logic of the decision in united states vs. williams is that money was involuntarily taken from mrs.  from mrs. williams.
mr. roddy, i thought that the way you got out of this problem was what your opponent has called careful pleading. i thought that  that what you were saying was that your client was targeted, that other competitors were not targeted, that this is something of a family  both of these companies are owned by the same family and there's some bad blood. is  is that part of the background of this?
may i ask you 
but, justice scalia, the in light of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's still  i mean, the rule is whether it's fairly subsumed within the question. and it is a logically prior question whether or not the statute extends to this particular situation.
can you have more than one proximate cause?
but how does it do that? i mean, if there's any object that congress had in mind, surely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner claims that are coming into federal district courts. and it hoped to do this by sending the  making sure that they went through the prison system first. whether we looked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that the prison system would get rid of a large  a large number of these frivolous claims. now, can you tell me how that purpose is possibly served 
well, i 
well, you  you could  it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding. if, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted?
subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?
may i ask 
 i actually have 
was it a reasonable question whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he knew it was a human being?
well, it depends on what ground we would lose here. if the court went on to decide the sufficiency of the allegations in a bivens-type case, which i don't think it should and which the court declined the invitation to do so in harlow, then we would not lose. if you did 
under their theory, but it seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when we do get the case on a petition for certiorari  couldn't review whether it was  whether it was in fact preemption.
that  that is true. but i submit that  i would like to hear what petitioner has to say. if petitioner's client had been given 10 years in this case, i have no doubt that petitioner would be arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. but i don't see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale that's consistent with section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts, unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis. thank you.
even  even if it's a question of jurisdiction.
let's assume that the  he seeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve. and then he then goes into  into district court under the apa. what would the final agency action be in your view?
i think, mr. dreeben, at the end of the day, i agree with you on the particularity argument, but do you take the  does the government take the position that the  that the  that a valid warrant need not contain an indication of the time within which it may be served, executed?
of course, it  it does. number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it applies only to interstate travel.
thank you, mr. englert. mr. feldman? official
well, i mean, once you start that, then you're saying that  which i thought was the  i would have agreed with the dissent  the concurrence in  in jefferson parish, but that's not the law. and so now what you're saying is, well, we have to go and really make that the law.
okay. so, this 
yes, but congress, i think under this scheme, envisioned having someone make all the state claims the first time around, gather them up and go to state court, and let them take as long as they like  no statute will run until that's complete  and then go to the federal court. and this does an end run around that approach.
do you  i think this question was asked earlier, but i want your position. how often does the vertex delivery occur in a d&x procedure? i 
but i'm having, i'm having the same problem as justice scalia and justice breyer. can you say in just a few sentences the difference between the case where there is sovereign immunity, china, the china hypothetical, and this case where it's organ immunity?
these cases  the congress gave them the right to bring a civil action in federal court.
that's more, rather 
 because that, it seems to me, is  and what is it that judge carter did that was wrong in this respect?
competent paid counsel.
that 
well, i suppose at some point, someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that. i think the safer thing is just to put the order down, say application, reopen the appeal time, granted. and then it would cause someone to go you know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is allotted under the rule in connection with the case. but i don't think it's unreasonable; in these circumstances we're only talking about three days to do an act. the act was done in two days.
our  yes and no. i think there is an ambiguity in the question, justice stevens, because it is true that the abbott method 
 do it, but tell me why that is consistent with the text.
but that isn't what you've said in the question presented. why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? and that would leave the other parts there.
okay.
okay.
well, in johnson wasn't there also 
absolutely. and my point is if  if that didn't work, including magazines, which is the equivalent of  essentially of  of newspapers, they had no logical or 
no, i don't think so, justice o'connor, and i think the reason is, at a minimum, 18 u.s.c. 3596, because i think that would now stand as an obstacle to that type of regulatory impression 
that there is a likelihood that, in a pattern, customers have gone to the favored dealer? that's  that begins to come within the statutory language in a way this case does not.
pardon me?
no, i'm  i'm very pleased to answer the question, your honor. i believe that the rule permits the judge to decide the 50(a) motion at any time prior to entering judgment. and the judge can change his or her mind on that at any time, because the issue is still before the court.
i hate to say this 
there is some minimal level.
is that case cited somewhere?
 you have to give us 
 have to look at social understanding on right to privacy? and how is it that you can construe, in every instance, a right of a cotenant to override the express objections of the other cotenant, who's there, and says no? how can you say that's acceptable?
so we're not  i take it we're not in a position whereby if we hold against you, we are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process.
no, but significantly in this case, the arguments regarding disparate questioning were never raised until federal habeas corpus proceedings. they were not raised at trial when the jury questionnaires still existed.
we have the rule that you just enunciated, and i don't want, before you sit down, to  i want to find out if you have an intermediate position, a fall-back position.
no.
the lower court, no, did not discuss the 
well, we haven't thought about that because we haven't proceeded on  on the contract. there may well  we  it probably is.
are there problems in computing maintenance and cure in a case like this one?
there's another one that fits 
i see.
whereas in your 
may i ask? i'm a little puzzled by the  the questioning. doesn't everyone agree that the predominant motive in all the districts was political? you agree to that, don't you?
 ibp case? as i understand it, whatever we do here is irrelevant to what the bottom line is going to be in that case, because the determination is going to be made only under state law. the court below said that's what it was going to do. and the employees are not objecting. so, it seems that that case, as distinguished from tum, is really not anything that this court should decide, because it would be academic.
mr. chief justice, of course we believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not need further interpretation by the court.
at that point, then maybe the respondent could determine there would be some form of regulation if, in fact, the discharge was into a ditch that was, in fact, regulated. and 
 in this opinion. i mean, that would make it happen, wouldn't it?
 evidentiary hearing 
yes.
so, why isn't 
that's the position you've taken in  in the halbert case, that the court should take the case?
well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is  focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?
all right.
no, but it's  that's not  only true under this provision of 1101(a)(4). the other  the other provisions  (f) and (g) and (j) and (q) and (t) that i mentioned, that looked to the sentence that may be imposed under state law, or that was actually imposed  would, likewise, render someone in that situation who was convicted of only a misdemeanor in state court  even though it might be a felony under federal law, they would not be  they would not be convicted of an aggravated felony, because 
it is  it is broader. but if  the discharge of a pollutant into the same body of water does not constitute the addition of a pollution  of a pollutant. it obviously is the addition of a pollutant. the only reason you could say that taking it from one  pumping it from one polluted body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant, which is what we said in miccosukee, the only basis for saying that is that there has been no discharge. there's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to the  to the other body of water. the only thing you can say is, there hasn't been a discharge. it's  because it's the same body of water.
i  may i interrupt you 
page 6 of the reply, your honor, very top. the citation says "13 u.s.c. 1724(b), emphasis added." it defines "demand" to include an order to pay issued by the secretary. and, in the next line down, we say, "for grisa thus recognizes that the so-call order to pay, far from concluding the action, in fact, commences it," because the statute of limitations prepared  uses the word "commenced" to describe what the action  the order to pay does. official
 fine. but it turns out he stops the guy every hour of the day, then he has a pretty strong case that this is for harassment, and it's not 
justice scalia, everything is different about this. that is, in your posited hypothetical, there is some law that you know will govern that ultimate question about disqualification or whatever the 
well, the only  i have two answers to that question, both of them i think directly answering your question. first of all, the statute is violated only when the precise object code is expatriated from the united states, when it is supplied from the united states. that's the violation. the other issues are damages, what damages are you entitled to. what is combined with the computer is the precise thing that is supplied because it is the precise sequence of commands.
well, that the that's the problem with the  with the warden's proposed test. are these, quote, "closely related claims"? that is not, i suggest, a  nearly a bright-line rule that would help the district courts in determining what is, and what is not, part of the same transaction. so, i don't think that that's a real viable alternative. i  again, i think it's important for the court to go back  if it's going to create a different rule in habeas, it has to have some grounding 
most of the income and revenue on guam comes from the federal income tax, because unlike on the mainland, the federal income tax goes to the guam treasury rather than the united states treasury.
that particular phrase resembles the one that justice breyer posited in his hypothetical.
well, my  my question is, isn't it better to have the police go to the magistrate when there's time for the magistrate to reflect, than to have this scenario where the police will say this was really dangerous stuff, exigent circumstances? wouldn't you want the officer to apply in advance for the warrant?
it is kind of ambiguous.
well, wouldn't it make a difference in a case in which an individual understands, number one, as a general matter, that it is wrong to kill people intentionally? he also believes that there are space aliens. and he believes that it is wrong to kill space aliens. but he kills one. under the full m'naghten test, under prong one, he would have a defense. but under the m'naghten test of prong two alone, since he believed it was wrong to kill martians, he wouldn't have a defense. isn't that right?
not the 
not 1981 cases.
yes, your honor. we believe  i believe eight states have said that. three states  at least three states have said that the burden of proof is on the parents in these proceedings. some states have taken different views and said if  i believe it's 
go ahead. i'm sorry.
i was hoping for an i, yes.
yes, but you knew that  you had the file. you knew the government was going to prove this. and you also knew it was an overt act.
well, your honor, i  i agree that this involves a very small class of cases. the problem with the government's reading is that they say that they are narrowly constricting the statute, but the procedural mechanism that they set up allows for a vast number of cases that would never fall within the statute of limitations to be filed and requires the court to deal with each and every one of those cases in the first instance. whereas, my reading of statute has the benefit of allowing a  a test case to proceed. given the fact that there are very few number of these rights that are made retroactively applicable, it  it makes more sense in terms of judicial resources to allow there to be this situation where is  there is a test case 
that's right.
well, because i think it is a reality, in responding to justice o'connor's question  i think that in  obviously, in all of these commerce 
we don't believe it is, your honor. we  we don't know for sure until we are entitled to litigate the regulation.
 never found it to be 
were there  were there any state court cases said that  or even in that case you're referring to  that the shuffle usually is race-based?
in the chapter 13 proceeding.
 that, in practical terms, that is exactly what it does, because the only way they can administer their law sensibly is by using these kinds of drugs, scheduled drugs.
would the same thing happen under multi-employer plans? would not the employees typically receive the benefits even if their employer did not make the contributions that it was required to make?
and the justice department was on one side, the sec was on the other. right?
well, there's two different reasons. the tribunal is not authorized, and that the charge doesn't state a violation. now, even if we assume that the tribunal is authorized and that all of its microprocedures are authorized under the act of congress, this  allowing this charge, conspiracy, is to open the floodgates to give the president the ability to charge whatever he wants 
i mean, does it show the necessary animus so that it carries through the whole case?
 as i recall.
you've certainly done it with respect to the eighth amendment. you've done it with respect to speech. you've done it with respect to 
would  would you comment on 10  on one difficulty i have with what, i take it, is your 11 preferred position of measuring due diligence from  as i 12 understand it, from the  the date at which the state 13 conviction became final? most of these  i think it is fair to say that 15 most of the state convictions, like most convictions in  16 in general, are going to rest on  on guilty pleas. it 17 just is not realistic to assume that congress assumed a 18 due diligence system which was going to require a state 19 defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a 20 guilty plea. i mean, if  if there  if there were 21 reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and 22 worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty 23 plea. and it seems to me that if we're going to 25 measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most 1 convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under 2 your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never 3 going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of 4 applying 2255. is  is that a fair comment, or have i  5 have i missed something?
you can shoot him. i'd be there shooting him, too.
doesn't it have a  in good condition. therefore, when they put it  therefore, i guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition, so maybe that is immune. and leaving it on the porch in a position where somebody would trip over it, you might say they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you don't trip over it. and that's good condition for the delivery.
 may i  no, go ahead.
to create a district with 50.9 percent voting age population here in this part of the state, it would be obvious that you weren't going to yield an opportunity district.
yes and no, and let me explain that. yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. those are enumerated based  based upon each individual plan. however, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.
 is the, quote, individually enforceable rights.
so what? you can sue too.
 the judge 
ms. blatt.
but it's  it's a peculiar, if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of constitutional values, and i don't know of anything comparable in  in malicious prosecution generically.
why isn't "in whole or in part" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence? why do you have to read that as official departing from proximate cause, instead of simply recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which  without barring it?
that's 
but it  but that was the test that the court was applying, as congress understood it, prior to smith, in which, i repeat, the court said there were certain statutes that categorical judgments could be made about. and the controlled substances act is such a statute, as this court recognized in raich and in oakland cannabis 
i think you better go with justice ginsburg. (laughter.)
that is true, your honor, but the threshold question was whether he had an expectation of privacy at all, or to the  the extent of that expectation of privacy. and the court, in knights, before it discussed the balance, had to identify the factors in the balance. in terms of the probationer's interest in that case, by virtue of the search condition, this court said that his interest in  his expectation of privacy was severely diminished, and left open specific 
is there any  why  why shouldn't that be a habeas action? why shouldn't 1983 be limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always  and referred to it as  as that in the past?
i guess in the 
well, counsel  counsel did 17 make use of several relatives of the defendant who 18 testified. i  i think weren't there about four 19 relatives who testified?
or whether the question of property right  the property right issue is not a question of federal law, it is a question of state law.
that's  that's really it, justice souter.
justice breyer knows that. he  he's worked there.
no. justice souter and justice ginsburg can protect their own questions. part of that allegation in here is that the state wasn't forthcoming with the  with  with the information requested, and you're not very forthcoming with the answers. what is the source, what is the legal source, what is the precedent for the proposition that the  that the condemned man has to come up with an alternative? what case do you cite? what principle do you cite?
from the filing of the  the final due date of the filing of the reply brief 
i'm not sure, justice ginsburg. in some of this court's dormant commerce clause cases, competitors, who are arguably injured because they are paying a higher tax against the  compared to the company that's receiving the benefit  in a couple of cases, this court has recognized customers of companies that are paying higher products, and, therefore, potentially higher prices, for the products that they purchase. and, in one or two cases, states have been recognized for purposes of standing. but 
but that's not the way the rule reads. the rule reads, as i understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. it doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.
you think that the  that the indictment had to specify which of the many things that he did, or the several things that he did when he approached the border constituted the overt act that the ninth circuit  he walked up to the border and he did a number of things to try to get into the united states.
yes, yes, justice ginsburg. 28 u.s.c., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy court shall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction, over the bankruptcy estate, and that has been interpreted by the courts as meaning that it has paramount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal in custodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is a bankruptcy court case.
yes.
your honor, judge easterbrook read section  subsection (d)(4) to require remand. petitioners and respondent's are in agreement in this court for the first time that (d)(4) does not apply to the remand in this case. it only applies to remands for expressly exempted actions. the  (d)(4), it says, shall be remanded. the corollary to that, we would submit, is that where congress recognizes that certain cases shall be remanded, even though they're within the removal jurisdiction, other cases, such as this one, may be remanded. otherwise, congress could have said all cases that are not precluded shall be remanded. and  and, justice ginsburg, it's not as counterintuitive as  as i think petitioners are trying to make it seem because there may be federal issues that continue past the preclusion 
 what your best thinking is of what totten means. it seems to me that this just means that there can be no contract formed under these circumstances.
that's correct.
what's the case 
correct.
well, he doesn't, justice scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all. that judge will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence. and unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency. and what the defendant is entitled to under the sixth amendment rulings of this court is knowing that if the law says if i commit this crime and these are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement. that's what the sixth amendment entitles you. but no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness. that defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed. nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judge's sentence. so i don't think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the sixth amendment. and i don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or any other part of the statute. what the court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and i submit it should ask the same question that it asked in booker itself: which alternative, the petitioner's alternative in this case or the government's, conforms more closely to congress's original claim in the sentencing reform act? the petitioner's version of appellate review as i understand it is very light review, if at all, of the substance of what the district judge does. it may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer, i think probation is the appropriate sentence. perhaps the petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that petitioner can feel free to give it away, petitioner gives the court nothing, and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable. and that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle.
mr. dreeben, does this authority to let someone in, over the objection of the cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it  is it also the case that  i don't know, as a matter of, what, property law, or whatever?  that when two people have common ownership of a piece of land or a house or whatever, and one of them says, "i don't want a certain party to come on," the tie always goes to the other party, who says, "i do want somebody to come on," is that  is there any cases that establish that proposition? it seems to me an odd proposition. i would have thought the opposite.
21 a or  
the irony of your position is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare cases where there was a denial of constitutional right.
of course, that's the issue, whether colorado intended to create it.
how could it be lesser included when, as we've heard, firearm does  i'm sorry  deadly weapon does not include firearm? if deadly weapon included firearm, then certainly  i'm sorry  deadly weapon would  would  could be a lesser included offense somehow. but the two are exclusive categories, aren't they?
well, the court, in the new york indians ii, recognized, to start with, that the treaty effected an immediate session of the oneida's wisconsin lands to the federal government, and the court specifically noted that that cession, in and of itself, would be sufficient consideration to support a contract between private parties. so it simply isn't correct to say that the new york oneidas gave up nothing other than a promise to remove. the second 
well 
thank you, counsel. mr. kneedler.
but if that's true, why do you need the words "miscarried"  why do you need the word "miscarriage" in the statute?
do we have any indication in your case about the effective safety of any other aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change their, their method of operation and go to a one-day protocol?
i thought the retailer was the tribe.
thank you, mr. reichel. mr. eastman, you have four minutes remaining.
 there was no finding that this was a good-cop/bad-cop 
right, and that's 
what was 
i actually point out that california, i think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it. and there are  i mean, it  justice kennedy is totally right. there are all kinds of combinations and permutations. there, there could be distributors who are in fact regulated private companies and local distributors who are owned by the city, and i guess there, there is one generator, at least, company that's owned by the  that's a  tv  with tva. they, they make their own. so there are all kinds of permutations and combinations. and i think we're getting at, when we take that aspect of the permutation and combination and say that aspect of it which is owned by a government says: "our way or the highway." you know, that's what they say. "buy from us." period. and if you're in a certain region, i've always thought they could do that. and i have to admit i never really looked it up; i've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.
 ms. lee. the case is submitted.
yes.
they haven't  neither has been certified, has it?
but what  what this court did say, in blue chip stamps, was that, when the birnbaum decision  and it was an interpretation of "in connection with purchase or sale" by what one justice on this court described as the "mother court of the court of appeals"  it was chief judge swan, judge augustus hand, and judge learned hand  and they construed the words "in connection with purchase or sale" to mean the plaintiff's purchase 
so then, the 
well, i just tried to say where  where it was. it's a  it's a way of  with proximate cause, and that's how i think you have to deal with it. you have a case where there was reliance.
and what that tells me, mr. chief justice, is that, that the district court felt that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the judge was bound  in other words, shifted the burden to the defendant to say, well, i  unless you can show that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that that is what the sixth amendment prohibits. if the guidelines are advisory, if they are but one of many factors to be considered, together with all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use that information, can use that reference. but once it starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines  and the statute doesn't admit to that.
for historical reasons, the denominations are quite strange, but for grisa, quoted  on subsections 1702 and 1724, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of official our reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay commences the proceedings. and so, since that is the 
right.
or anything else.
so are you  are you arguing now that  that (5)(a)  (d)(5)(a), is the statute under which you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has nothing to do with the case?
but there are so many things that you could dress up as being a taking. and  and so it seems to me that it's up to the artful pleader to say whether this is a due process excessive regulation or this is intrusive to the point where it amounts to a taking. i mean, the  the  would you  rent control is one. what about  suppose hawaii had said, we're going to cap the price of gas so it will make it easier for these stations to survive.
thank you, mr. kneedler. the case is submitted.
well, when you say they pushed in delaware, you brought them into delaware and a  in a reverse suit. you wanted a declaration of non liability.
isn't that correct?
you're talking about 
does that mean that 75 percent had not?
and you couldn't have two companies say we're not going to  we're going to have a joint venture on this corner, but in  you know, down the block, we're going to compete, and then it's all right to set prices on this corner but not down the block.
yes.
page 9 of their reply brief.
we are going to visit the state capital and we are not marching down the street with 15 foot banners. i mean, does the first amendment say the teacher can't say that?
your honor, this court defers to congress, in matters of the military, when the military or the congress is especially expert and this court is especially naive. this court has never deferred to a congressional statute about military when 
maybe, the same point, isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in these attempt cases is characteristically going to be pretty close to zero? i mean, they're not in the house. they're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples we've been talking about.
no, but the standard fruit analysis is when you get something like a statement, and that statement then leads to further evidence. we're not  i mean, justice breyer wasn't using the fruits analysis in that sense. he was  he was getting at the  at the same question we're all trying to get at: was the later so-called initiation the product of the improper police comment in the first place, or was it voluntary?
yes, i'm confused.
yes, sir. you 
what about  what about  listen to what i'm about to say. i'm thinking of the standard. the standard would be where the allegations are such, where the case is such that  to go further  that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law; and there is evidence to support that, of  strong evidence to support it, or the evidence in support thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected. under those circumstances there is no immunity.
that is correct. the record in this case does not identify a connection between this wetland and this non-navigable ditch.
why, just out of curiosity  i'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot of civil cases, but when somebody  let's say the defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried and finished. at the very end, he says, "oh, my god." and now he goes in and asks to amend it under rule 15. do judges normally say, "fine"?
i would say yes.
and  and i think that's what's before us here. it  it seems to me that your best argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85 damages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to compute, but that doesn't quite work because this court  and of course, the special master  allowed damages  the interest on post-'85 damages even though those are equally difficult to compute.
they each have their problems.
is that the case in federal courts, too?
i think where it's wrong, your honor, is that it proceeds from an assumption that is wrong in itself and that is 
is that in fact how it was done?
well, i 
well, i think i disagree, at least 
i don't think so. all i'm saying is if you started with trying to compensate pay phone operators for the service they provide  that you're characterizing as the service they provide to long distance carriers, you end up with a far different number. who knows what you would end up with. probably end up with zero. because take an example of somebody who rents a cell phone for the weekend. they might make lots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be kicking back money, for example, to the store that rented the cell phone to the customer over the weekend. and i want to return, i think in justice breyer's question 
but what 
your honor, let me explain why that's the case, and there was an answer 
in  in the second he raised that plus that the colloquy itself was defective and that the sentence, the life without parole sentence, was illegal and unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation aspect. so they were different claims. let me start with statutory tolling. section 2244(d)(2) of aedpa provides tolling during properly filed applications for state post-conviction review. under this court's unanimous decision in artuz, mr. pace's pcra petition was properly filed. in fact, the pcra time bar functions in all material ways like the new york state procedural bar rules at issue in artuz. now, artuz also identified some types of rules that would prevent an application from being properly filed, for example, the aedpa successive bar which makes you go to the court of appeals first and get permission before you can actually file in the district court, and it has a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions with a prima facie chance get filed. the pcra time bar is nothing like that at all. it's like the state court procedural bar rules in artuz. there's no condition to filing. you can go and file at any time. the court, as a matter of law, has to take your petition, has to give it judicial review  yes, your honor.
but why would we have a separate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal notification?
the instruction, the paragraph that is subject to the great criticism on the other side, was a paragraph that was drafted by the district judge and handed out near the end of the trial and then commented on by the lawyers in, prior to 
but, of course, here 
 from other death-eligible 
okay.
they've used the failing company doctrine, your honor, both in northern securities and in citizens publishing, and that was the  that was the reason what  which they gave initially to join, and that was an issue. and justice harlan said, okay, that was an issue. he thought that that should be tried. but that was not pertinent to the question of whether or not the pricing, if it is so divorced  i  i must bring  bring the court back to this statement by the chief executive officer. he said that the cost savings and all the synergies, the pricing had nothing to do with it. nothing he said. so if it had nothing to do with it, then what are they doing fixing the price?
would  would you finish  would you finish please 
i understand, but that has nothing to do with whether you have standing. that has to do with the merits of the case. but on the standing point, only new cars would be affected, right? so even the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years, wouldn't it?
well, we'd look to the common core. and i think we would argue that one is focusing on counsel's performance, and the other is on police misconduct. but, justice souter 
is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not? and if it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?
well, it was correct.
well, again, because  because if you  if you broaden the right to state-paid counsel, as  as in douglas, you're going to require states to  to reallocate resources to that priority and away from other priorities. also, if you  if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that standard. and also, if  and this is particularly important here i think. if you require states to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a  of a plea-based conviction, then you give the states a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether. and  and, you know, who knows? but perhaps that's what's going on in the  in the trend in the states away from providing this right. thank you.
i think it certainly could be. in brown versus payton there was certainly a concern about the 
well, i thought you said earlier motive was not the test, in response to i think it was justice alito.
what's the  what's the source of the implication?
what would be a really expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the government here, and it takes the position quite different from yours.
yes. yes, your honor. in  in this case 
ms. mckiever.
what's your answer to the 180 days question i answered  i asked? you know, the provision provides contributions. it doesn't say just contributions to an employee benefit plan. it says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but  but the services have to be within the last 180 days.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
intentional 
your honor, the  that section was not argued to the district court, but it was invoked in the following way, in two ways. first of all, there was evidence introduced in the case that she was providing legal advice. and since it is not in affirmative defense, it really was the government's burden at all times, at least once there was evidence introduced that she was providing legal advice, to get a finding from the jury that she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services, particularly in this case, your honor, where the government argued, told the jury, that nancy temple was the, quote, "central figure," end quote, in this  in this episode. and in addition 
no, and here's the reason. the  the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on the defendant initially.
let me help you out by taking you back to my question. one of the characteristics of the affirmative action cases was the displacement of some other otherwise generally acknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown in test scores, grade point averages, things like that; and that was a characteristic of those cases. it is not a characteristic of this case, as i understand it.
and canada does not.
it is wrong, your honor. it's certainly not the case that we have an sla inspector outside every entity that sells liquor. that would not be possible. but it is true that the state liquor authority can, and does, physically inspect the premises. they do so to determine whether 
in other words, it doesn't matter it it's a watershed, i guess it is a point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters whether it is a watershed rule if you read aedpa 2254(d)(1) by its terms.
may i ask you if in exercising prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential standing, because i guess there's article iii standing here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore that aspect of the case?
but why  why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? let's  can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?
with absolute certainty, mr. chief justice, yes, because they asked the same questions. they asked where did the error occur, and that the line of the questionings were almost  on that point was identical. they asked questions where did the error come, and of course, it wasn't in the first trial. the error occurred at the motion to vacate.
now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories? you'd win this case, but i'm talking about how broad is the rule that you're urging us to adopt?
well, chief justice roberts, the fcc was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this. so the question is whether you can go back to 201. and as i said, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because we're in federal court. and that says that violations of the act are remediable but not of regulations, in contrast to numerous other sections. so the question in asking whether it violates 201, official it has to be something more than simply the fcc's regulation wasn't followed. and we need to ask ourselves what kind of regulation is it.
of boyde? it's straightforward application of boyde?
and  and in those cases, the jurisdictional grant in the jones act does include elements of jurisdiction. so it's  it's required. but i don't  i don't believe that the jones act has the same type of language, mr. chief justice, that title vii has, requiring that these cases be heard expeditiously. so 
and that's what he's arguing for here.
what are the factors in missouri that the state would be trying to prove to urge the imposition of death versus life imprisonment? what are the things in missouri that are deemed relevant?
and she continued to do that, to follow their instructions.
 to bring 
 which yours don't do.
that  that may be  that may be the  the best response. and i take it, so far as you know, there  there are no studies that have gone into this on an empirical basis. is that correct, so far as you know?
again, i'm  i'm trying to be as specific as i can. there may be situations in which, even in the class action context, there's a fee agreement between the  the class member and the lawyer so that the payment of attorney's fees is in satisfaction of a debt owed by the class member, and in that situation we think that it would be 
i mean, what's the authority for that?
that is certainly one of the factors that  that the commissioner has looked to in those class 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
certainly, your honor. i believe if you take a look at some of the model policies already in place by police departments around the country that are attached to the amicus brief of the law enforcement agencies that filed on our behalf, you'll see some policies whereby the person at the desk taking the information is required to have certain types of questions and provide certain types of responses to those questions.
they 
correct, your honor. no other remedy but  but suppression.
because  because we have a rule that says when congress wants the united states to be sued, it  it must say so clearly.
they claim that, under the licensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid claims. that's count one of the complaint, in the (j) 
but if the intent is to hit the person with the alligator that you're swinging 
even if it didn't, though, i suppose you could draw a line between people who were doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear mourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and be reminded of the person who died and sob. but in this case, they're going out of their way to do something that people in mourning do not normally do.
at the point at which she realized the police weren't really going to do anything, she found out her children were dead. that would have been at that point in time a meaningless process.
well 
if the attitude is the one that this board has taken, then the same reasons would exist for the plan as long as there is segregation in housing.
certainly, justice ginsburg.
 under their 
i'll take them in your precise order.
was that not consistent with the confession?
thank you, general. mr. goldberg, you have 4 minutes remaining.
when you tell a jury that a person 10 is a violent recidivist who learns the lesson  he's a 11 recidivist. he's going to commit more crimes if he's out. 12 the lesson he learns is when he commits those more crimes, 13 don't leave anybody behind. i  i see that as an argument that  that is 15 far beyond simmons itself as to future dangerousness. in 16 future dangerousness, justice scalia, you  you argued in 17 the dissent that the future dangerousness  that what the 18 plurality and justice o'connor construed as a future 19 dangerousness argument could have had another purpose. 20 only in a state like texas where you have a pure future 21 dangerousness argument, in every state where you have 22 other aggravators before the jury, of course you can 23 construe it for another 
yes. on the  on the waiting before the clothes, there's  there are two series of waits: the first wait and then later waits. as to the later waits, once you decide that the donning begins the process of principal activities 
what  the photographing of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and they pay him for that. and then he claims that the blm follows them just to harass them, just taking photographs. what relief could he get for that?
i think at the end of the day i would make that argument. i don't have to make that argument here because it's clear to me that the same standards of matushita and monsanto that say you have to exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading stage, so there is no disconnect. but if i were actually forced into that position, i think i would take that view, although i probably would argue first that the standard of huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than rejecting clearly what congress had in mind in 1995 when it acted to curb the abuses of private securities litigation.
mr. chief justice, at first, the  the first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as this court stated in wilford v. biscotti. look at the fair import of the decision. now, i don't know if you are referring to the issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at the end of the state court's decision here, but the first question is to look at the fair import. and if the fair import is that the correct test was applied, then habeas relief does not lie.
 recreational purposes, how is the federal government supposed to enforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?
your honor, that might or might not be correct, depending on how one views the scope of the nonintercourse act. but if one views the scope of the nonintercourse act to apply to indian reservations, even state reservations, as the second circuit in mohican tribe has held, then the treaty of fort schuyler could have terminated all aboriginal title; the treaty of fort schuyler could have established a state reservation for the oneidas; and the nonintercourse act of 1790, two years later, could have prohibited the sale of those lands even though it was a state reservation and under state jurisdiction.
what i liked about your decision in that case, justice scalia, was that you said that the officer's culpability for using excessive force is not diminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to continue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in garner or the fleeing driver in brower. excuse me, mr. chief justice.
let me just ask this question. in trying to assess the likelihood of harm to innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming that the chase will continue? or do we measure it by assuming that the chase would be discontinued?
and congress said, those entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: they get a federal forum and they get a judge trial. that's all that's at stake.
are you  are you relying at all on the effect that you want the court's decision to have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a judge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who shouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an automatic new trial? and the prosecutor who's standing by  by the way, what did the prosecutor  did the prosecutor take the position in this case when the judge says, i don't want that lawyer to be in my courtroom?
 level 2, that sort of thing? why is it that there's a liberty interest in being transferred  i guess being transferred from 4 to 5?
no, your honor, that's not what i'm saying.
do we  do we know whether any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four categories where you a  a right to?
your  your honor, i would refer  i  the only thing in the record is the affidavits of  of the retained counsel. he made that as a strategic judgment. obviously 
he said that the state can prohibit something even if it is the safest official procedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't 
and you didn't ask for a hearing en banc.
 a different question.
 if  if the defense has not been forced at that point to choose to rest or put on a case. that is the 
why?
okay, there's no such case and therefore this would be the first.
well 
justice kennedy, for several decades, law schools have had these policies and applied them to career-services offices. no other schools within the 
 that could be a 19, 20, or 24.
i'm asking for not the state's position but your position.
 of the conviction.
the california supreme court has held, in people v. reyes, and in other cases cited in our brief, that, in california, parole is not a matter of choice, it is imposed as a matter of law.
thank you, mr. salmons. mr. becker.
but did they cite that case in this case, in this opinion in this case?
why didn't we simply take the closest federal definition as being the touchstone?
right.
and  and do you understand that to be a fourth amendment requirement, i.e., no futility exception?
sure.
the answer, i would suggest, justice scalia, requires looking to california practice. and where i would start is with the california supreme court's decision in in re sanders. and in in re sanders, the court made clear that after the supreme court adopted their policies in 1989 regarding certain presumptions in capital cases, and after the seminal in re clark case in 1993, which asserted  rather, articulated california's timeliness standards, most petitions  and these are the california supreme court's words  "most petitions are timely filed." so, with that backdrop and the fact that half of the california supreme court's cases are being denied with a case citation, it's reasonable to conclude that the unexplained denials are not necessarily untimely. now, i would add to that 
i mean, if you're worried about it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as earlier? i mean, if that's going to be a problem, we should know it sooner rather than later, rather than  you know. if you say that's terribly difficult to prove, we can hardly ever prove it, well, good. then let's get rid of this  rid of the case earlier.
there's  there's variation, sure. now, on  on 
a storm drain, even  even when it's not filled with water, is a tributary. right?
 after that.
but  but don't you reconcile the  the problem of the straddle by saying that unless the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid?isn't that your position?
that's exactly right. and, certainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that is emphatically the case.
do we take it as a given that if he does not consent, in fact, directs his lawyer not to make this concession, that the lawyer is bound to follow?
 that is not in the record. in their response brief, they said that they currently do have clients, but in the complaint  this case was, again, a facial challenge. it was decided on summary disposition or it was a motion to dismiss. it was filed and decided within about a month. and there was no factual development here. if they had actual clients, there would be clearly a closer relationship, but again, those clients would not be hindered from making the claims themselves. there is no reason 
thank you.
the principal point was that the court of appeals could not enter  direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not been made. that's what those three cases 
except, your honor, this court has said that it doesn't decide issues that weren't presented to it. and if you look at page 397 
 somewhat novel for the court of appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of what it thought the weight of the evidence was. it's one thing to say, "if he's denied or granted a motion for a new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of discretion," but for the appellate court to do that de novo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to me, quite unusual.
well, what if we think it does? because that's how i read it, too, that matlock governs where one of the people is absent. and we have a situation that's different here. now what rule do we look to?
let me suggest this. wouldn't  wouldn't he almost necessarily have to consider at step three those reasons that the prosecutor has not given, but which he thinks might be good reasons for the challenge which do not raise batson discrimination?
 whether you think they could do that.
well, your honor, i have not been suggesting that that single factor is what makes california's law constitutional. what makes california's law constitutional is the fact that the constraint imposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a reasonableness requirement, just like booker.
well, starting at 28 u.s.c., why it's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative agency actions and actions in courts. and sometimes in 28 u.s.c. there are provisions that apply to both. the federal tort claims act, for example, is in 28 u.s.c., and it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims. people must file their claims before an agency first, and then the agency can do administrative adjustment. that's entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to compromise the claim once it's filed in court. section  title 5 also contains things that apply to courts and agencies  the right to judicial review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's necessary for those  in addition to standards that govern judicial review of agency actions. those were all in title 5, but they actually apply to courts. these 
you can sue and you have to sue for the battery immediately.
 in the district.
okay?
isn't that what the state does when it denies a diminished-capacity  says, "we will not have a diminished-capacity defense"?
so, a person who just leaves voluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come back for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(b).
okay, well, let  let's just assume that you've conceded that. now, you've been guarded about it. if we can do that by statute, why can't we do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of  judicial court of massachusetts?
it makes perfect sense. i don't see there's any discrimination.
can i ask you 
you didn't  i thought that  you didn't see that?
 then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter. so this 
but they also have a written charge, so they get a written charge with the instruction.
what this court has done i think, in the course of the 20th century jurisprudence that has examined the right to counsel, is establish a hierarchy of the critical rights that are necessary for a fair trial. the first, of course, is that 
 i realize that. but, beyond that, do we have any empirical evidence, one way or the other?
first, dr. cooke is at ja1079 and 24 1069. dr. sadoff is at 1105 and 1122.
thank you, ms. freno.
mr. dreeben, if we disagree with you here, could this defendant be retried? could he be reindicted?
well, if it makes a difference, then the lens that i look at this through is called our  whatever the second-tier commercial speech lends.
do you have a claim for damages as well.
may i just clear up one detail that's confusing to me. the  are there two judges? does the same judge rule on both the motion to convert and the motion to reconvert?
but you also say, on this record.
well, i mean 
please.
well, but again, though, justice ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and i respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that 
well i guess you're asking us to say crawford, get one, take one, it is really not that important. if that's so, i suppose we shouldn't have overruled roberts.
thank you, counsel.
well, if the employee 
so what you'd have to say is why that's good enough.
may i ask you if the practice of law has returned to normal in new orleans?
okay, assuming that explicit message, could habeas relief be granted in my hypothetical case?
justice kennedy, i think the answer turns on the reason that the schools have the racial compositions that they do.
justice ginsburg, the first circuit went well beyond because it focused on a general health exception, they've now focusing it on an emergency exception. but certainly the relief should have been as-applied. if i may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal?
thank you, mr. garre.
it would  it would potentially violate the 1-year limit. that won't necessarily work.
it is, your honor. if the court were to look at the district court order, the district court order was divided into two distinct parts. the first part 
that's right.
suppose the state 
yes.
with respect, justice scalia, nobody forced van orden to walk by the ten commandments display in texas at gunpoint, and yet this court said that he could bring an establishment clause challenge. so i think there would be directly injured people who could challenge your sort of end of the slippery slope 
your honor, it occurred in argument. and my counsel  esteemed co-counsel will give me the exact page  but it occurred in the context  the context  during the prosecutor's argument, the prosecutor said to the jury that, "i suspect"  and then he, for emphasis, said, "i can't imagine that you won't be told that the religious-conversion evidence doesn't fit within factor (k)." and, at that point, he expressed reservations, doubts, as to whether it did fit in factor (k) or 
none of them is like that.
if 
 released on parole.
it does not go to the mental state, in this case, because arizona law, under state v. mott, precludes its consideration for that purpose  -
but your procedure, if i understand it, would be prohibited to be applied to dogs or cats.
but that's a jurisdictional hook, isn't it?
because, i mean, you're  you're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but certainly the government could  could have asked the  asked the district court to make the necessary findings.
but why would 
and  and what is your response to that?
does the statute  does the federal statute specifically authorize doctors to do this? or does it simply say that convicts may be executed by lethal injection?
the district court thought it was and one we did, the district court said i have no authority in  under  over any of these people. so back it goes.
no, but you're  you're saying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in this case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would be open to california to prove that in fact he didn't do any of those things, but was merely an accessory after the fact? that  that's your position? that's what california pleading law allows?
their presence was the product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we admitted in the  the material that they obtained in the search after a warrant had been obtained.
which is a new  a new parole hearing. isn't  i mean, it  i 
no. the character of the water 
well, your honor, i believe that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive sentence on the free crimes was  standing alone would have been sufficient.
on justice scalia's question, i was trying to think of some, and i was trying to think the analogy might  you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the  or a ferris wheel or something. what you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally. and now would a  would a court issue an injunction there? and as i think about that, i don't realize i don't know the answer.
on my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? they've got two cases before them. one, the judge departs three years because of military service. the prosecutor appeals. the other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. should those  what should happen with those two cases?
so if they have a different view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever facts develop? if there is an appropriate body of medical opinion that does in fact believe this is necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and the abortion could be performed and the injunction would say that.
well, under my hypothetical. i don't know exactly how  the way it works, you have to be a new york wholesaler to sell to a new york retailer. under your view, a new jersey wholesaler could sell to a new york retailer.
but that's because 
at least 
i'm sorry, your honor. the  in this case, the prosecutor made a mistake. i don't think that there's any evidence to support the conclusion that the prosecutor committed misconduct in this case, particularly 
that does not resolve the present case, justice scalia, because the  mamsi's interpretation of the barnes line of cases, the equitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely negate the limitation that congress put into 502(a)(3). and  and if you'd permit me to explain why. a remedy of an equitable lien by assignment, as we explained in our opening brief, is not a restitutionary remedy. no unjust enrichment need be proved. no tracing need be proved. it's purely a contractual remedy. now, as a result, courts of equity historically developed this remedy to give priority to one creditor over another if there was a present intent on the part of the promisor to pledge that specific property as security.
 because it was not 
well, that depends 
well, with respect, justice kennedy, i don't believe the court is making up a rule of accrual. i think those rules are quite well settled. cases like ricks and chardon make clear, and the fourth amendment cases make clear that a fourth amendment violation, unlike the fifth, where evidence is used at trial, the fourth amendment claim violation is fully accomplished at the time of the illegal search or seizure. anything 
this is different from that because this is a situation where when the telecommunications act was passed in 1996, congress expected that the ilecs would compete in one another's territories as clecs. the defendants pledged that they would compete in one another's territories at ilecs. they then for years in congress complained that the clecs who were trying to compete with them were given an unfair advantage in the terms and conditions on which they were permitted to 
because they are two different statutes and the elements of the plaintiff's claims are fundamentally different. that's the fundamental flaw in the petitioner's claim in this case. let me explain, if i may, justice scalia. in a title vii case, in an intentional discrimination case, the question is whether or not there is an act that is motivated by gender during the charge filing period. that is not an element of the plaintiff's cause of action in an equal pay act case. in an equal pay act case, all the plaintiff has to do is allege they are performing equal work to a male, and that they are paid differently. and it's that cause of action that triggers the statute of limitations in an equal pay act case. that's fundamentally different. as chief justice roberts said 
no, your honor, but the trustee makes a finding that the  the causation  or reports to the court that causation principles could not be established, and so there was no point in bringing a 1981 claim because he actually found in  in materials that are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding 
i apply electricity to all methods of putting down letters with electricity. i apply the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine test.
okay, let me try 
that's not really  i mean, to be fair, your honor, that's not what he testified to, exactly. what he said was, he's been shot at several times, and he went in early, in this case, in part because of his safety concerns. but he didn't speak to any broader policy.
thank you, mr. linger. mr. poe, you have about 3 minutes.
no, your honor. i handled this matter only post-trial.
are you sure it's not 18(a)?
well, but we didn't come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands. the corps of engineers has it in their regulations.
yes, we do.
we've done it for several hundred years, haven't we 
 the whole basis for the constitutionality of the statute, i think, is the enforcement clause of the fourteenth amendment.
yes, i think that's true. and there's also a difference i think in the attitude of  of the inmates when they're in  in a state of flux in a jail as opposed to when they arrive to serve their many years-long sentence, in the case of mr. johnson, 37 years to life. and then i think the reality sets in and  and things do change. prison is very different.
what their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the osc if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing.
yes.
and what if they  what if they somehow or other fraudulently persuaded the revenue agents of the state to impose higher taxes and penalties on the competitor?
the water  take the  mr. chief justice's barrel of water that has not been removed from the river  it comes down the river. it changes as it goes down the river. it is potentially changed in the impoundment area. it then flows through the dam.
i mean, we couldn't sell this the first time out.
that could be, but here the trial court's 
we're talking about components, for example. it doesn't seem to me it makes any difference whether general motors has a monopoly or not when it wants to sell, you know, two components as part of the same package. anyway, i've gone astray too much.
so for you to win to preserve your sixth circuit victory, that would have to be ruled out.
well  well, justice ginsburg, they're doing it under these decisions of this court is the reason why that they've articulated that this has to be done. they're saying it's a functional equivalent of a guilty plea. therefore, boykin is required and therefore there has to be a colloquy. and we think that those colloquies are tremendously problematic, that they invade the attorney-client privilege. they may affect an accused's right to  you know, not to self-incriminate himself. there may violate the relationship between the lawyer and his client.
other than its language as to what it's for.
that's fine.
well, that's already what happens under the federal rules of evidence and under the evidence of many states, that there is a rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing. and so 
what 
no, that's not true, justice souter.
well, you said  you said in your brief that  that it's always in the  with the possible exception of capital cases, it's always in the interest of a habeas applicant to get  get it decided as soon as possible. that's not really true. sometimes it's  it's in his interest to delay it as much as possible. witnesses will die. people will move away. all sorts of  there are all sorts of reasons why he  he might want to delay the process.
mr. chief justice, let me give you an example. the answer is yes. in a case in which there is removal jurisdiction because the defense is colorable, there may be a factual issue as to whether the in-connection-with requirement is met. in 10b-5 cases, it's not uncommon that that is a factual question, not a legal question. the federal court would then retain jurisdiction to decide that question on summary judgment, at trial, or whatever. it won't know until it finally disposes of the 
at least they are not separate corporate subsidiaries.
i think, justice scalia, what the 
thank you, ms. mckiever. ms. karlan, you have about 7 minutes. you're not required to use it all.
at most, it 
he does.
but  but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply  is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.
 action, and that's how you distinguish the municipal taxpayer.
it make difference. it makes a difference.
there were 
thank you, counsel. mr. olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.
yes, your honor. i think that it would be fair to say that  that any of the nine states collected in our appendix whose standard is does the evidence raise a reasonable inference of innocence look at those sorts of questions. in addition, we collected, i believe, four cases in our brief, in addition to the california court of appeal and the d.c. circuit's opinion in cabrera. there's the kansas v. adams case which very clearly looks at the state evidence. in that case, the issue was the defendant was on trial for shaking his baby to death, and the medical evidence of the prosecution showed that the death took place within a certain time period. the defendant wanted to introduce evidence that his wife 
that's in mark faninger's deposition, and he is the supervisor that was 
your honor, the whole point of factor (k) is that  evidence that's an excuse for the crime. and if we're 
i think it's inappropriate, your honor, because while there should be uniformity in an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not the end all and be all. 3553(a) addresses individualized sentencing of the defendant before the court.
that's right. it is  it is 
if it was found to be a decision that was reasonably related to the crime  i'm sorry, to the decision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be upheld as a valid aggravating factor. but i believe that it would still need to be then, if it would be considered a valid aggravating factor, then it would need to be tried by the jury.
because at the outset there's no probable cause to believe that any one of those 17  unless you think one-seventeenth is enough for probable cause.
that's a rewriting of the statute.
saying that there is no private-party analog is not quite the same thing as saying you lose under what we consider to be the proper private-party analog  namely, good samaritan.
i 
oh, yeah, but that assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me the problem that we've got is the problem of connecting a past discrimination with what may in fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years later.
justice scalia, i would beg to differ on that. mr. stone in his affidavit at 179 in the joint appendix and also in his disclosure statement, which is at 29  i'm sorry, 174 and 175 of the joint appendix, and the disclosure statement at 290, what he described was a defective design of the system for taking the sludge out of the pond. and what he specifically said  and this is very important  what he specifically said was when you took the sludge out of the ponds in that manner, it was going to have too much liquid, and it was going to lead to deterioration of the environment. he said that in the very beginning of the case. and at trial, what the testimony was  and i would direct the court to mr. freibach's testimony at joint appendix 522, as well as at the trial transcript at 987, the issue there was the variability of the sludge which may have caused greater inspections and may have required additional cement. and what is very important is even mr. freibach who is the first foreman, on whom petitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure, the variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350 pounds of cement. that's at the trial transcript at 987 and the joint appendix at 522.
thank you, counsel. ms. mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.
uh-huh.
so you've got to sue under state law, but you would  you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, i suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the  the warning given in compliance with fifra was an inadequate warning. that would  that would keep you within the  the  in effect, the  the federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a state law cause of action, not a federal cause of action.
it's enough to be pretty close.
he meant to commit another 
mr. joseph, do i take it that the essence of your position is that a removing defendant, if that removing party is a corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may have been involved in the  in the occurrence that the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a defendant, that a defendant  although, on the surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant corporation must, in order to remove, identify all subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been sued, as well?
then you don't mean reasonableness. you mean something else.
under washington law, is it lawful for your client to have headlights  wig-wag lights?
but is  just again, i'm not trying to find out the answer to what happened here, but just as a matter of what the law provides. is it conceivable that a  a gun which was not operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because it can be used as a club?
basically, every single time that there is a transaction, it is recorded by the u.s. trade and tax bureau. and if it may please the court, i'd like to reserve the rest of my time 
that's right. now, so  so the real question here, with regard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense to extend what the court did in douglas to this new situation. we think it does not. this court's decisions, ross and justice kennedy's concurrence in  in murray, as i recall, draw  draw a distinction between the removal of barriers that the state imposes to the exercise of litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand, subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights and  and i think this court's care in distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary appeals reflects a desire to cabin douglas and  and to avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies. and we think that's a  we think that's  we think that's good as a matter of policy for the court to do that, for one thing 
interestingly, what your honor said in the seibert case is that when  and, in fact, the plurality opinion  when you give an alleged cure in the midst of the violation, the defendant misses it. so, giving this alleged cure in the midst of the violation creates the problem. what you need to do is 
in the efig statute?
a few of the student  a few of the relay runners were from the school and had been allowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band played as it went by. i do not believe that made the torch relay a school event. the best that can be said for them is that they let the students watch it with the concurrence of individual teachers, and that that attendance was a school sanctioned attendance. now whether that allows them to then engage in this kind of punishment for speech by a student who was not even among those released, who is standing 
many of the treaty partners view it as conferring a right, at least 11 tell an arrestee of his rights under  under the treaty and 
and then 
so, you go back to the language  are you finished with that answer? go ahead and finish, if you want.
but that does not help you with respect to the other claim, the claim that there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors from coming in. there's no plus factor as i understand it alleged there, and i also understand that it would have been entirely in the interest of each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and that there is no need for them to agree to do that. it would be the most natural thing in the world to do it. what do you say about that part of your case?
there's a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph (d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).
the problem that i think some of  several of us are having is that both the  as i understand it, the fifth circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of situations. situation a: there's something that the manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the label, but the manufacturer didn't. situation b: the manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is wrong and in justice stevens' example is in fact false and it causes harm. it makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the ground that i bought it in reliance on the label, the label was false, i should get damages for  for whatever harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for preemption purposes differently from the situation in which the  the manufacturer made no false statement. he simply should have said more. and if  if you don't distinguish between those two situations, then the  the prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing because  because it can never be enforced, in effect, except with respect to some prospective user. it can never be enforced with respect to the actual user.
i  they may say that that's the same thing, but i  they were drawing a distinction between paying for it out of general funds  income tax or something  that we all would pay for. they say that's the solution, rather than having the industry, that benefits from the advertising, pay for it. not only does the industry benefit 
no, no, no, not necessarily. he  he's just saying the parole hearing i got lacked due process safeguards. had i had those safeguards, i might  i might  have been given a shorter sentence. i can't prove i would have. i'm not challenging the sentence really, but i want a new hearing. i didn't get due process. give me a proper hearing because i might get out earlier. why shouldn't that come under habeas?
all right. let's suppose to get away from it  can i go  are you finished with equitable tolling because i want to go back to 
is it reasonable  is it reasonable to suppose, on the basis reading the allegations as they have to be read at this stage of the proceeding  is it reasonable to infer that  from the allegation that there is an understanding between mohawk and the employment agencies that mohawk will provide this documentation and therefore make the scheme work?
so doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?
well, i think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other. if you didn't say that, that would be the result. you give modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable here. you give it whatever reading you think is reasonable in the other place. but when you say the two have to be the same, it seems to me you have something else in mind.
no, no, no. this is not a machine tool. the thing that was violated, the machine readable object code, is precisely what is installed on the computer and precisely what is moved from one part of the computer to another in different forms as the computer operates and it continually instructs. this is dynamic. it's not 
there is a generic rule on this, and there is a consensus among the vast majority of states. i point to both professor lefave as well as the model penal code. and what these rules say  and this is true in the vast majority of states, 42 states by our count  is that if you take either permanently or for an unreasonable amount of time such that it would deprive the owner of the significant portion of the economic value, then that constitute a theft offense.
 i take it, it would be okay if the beef producers had to use a dollar a head to put, "eating too much beef is dangerous to your health."
well, what i said to justice alito was, if the employer knew that it previously had a policy and if it knew and intended that its present pay would be done for gender-related reasons or racially-related reasons, it would constitute 
do you know of any 
no, i don't think so. i  i think that helps the argument. but in fact, there are lots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellate proceedings that  that do result in decisions on the merits. this court, for example, sometimes summarily affirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the court does that doesn't create 
i think that's a  i think that's a very important point, and before a  a court enters into that, in the end, unknowable question, maybe a court can  can, in the end, determine probabilities, but before a court undertakes that, which requires looking not simply at the motivation of the  of the law enforcement officers, but the prosecutor and  and who knows whether the grand jury would have returned an indictment, and yet a court certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that. now, so we  we think that that's another reason why the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway before a court is  is going to enter into that determination. and all  and it's important to remember it's not just proving the question of causation, but these are people who are several steps removed from the  from the prosecutorial decision. and the  and the personal liability would be visited on the law enforcement agents who were doing their job and cooperating with the u.s. attorney's office. this case was  this case got attention at the highest levels of the u.s. attorney's office. the u.s. attorney personally met with the  the respondent  lawyers for respondent.
well, i will grant that's required, but the argument, as i understand it, is, to find out whether they're doing what they are required to do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit. and that's one thing in the state; it's another thing across the country.
your honor, i'm sorry. i didn't understand your question.
 where the word includes stood alone within that section, it was natural for congress to use what we call a  a belt and suspenders approach, making it clear that the word includes shouldn't be taken as exclusive. the second point i'd make is that the last of  i believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the definition of pattern of racketeering activity. and that definition is introduced by the word requires. the term pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two racketeering acts committed not more than 10 years apart. and this court in sedima and then in h.j., incorporated has attached significance to that choice of verbs and has explained that congress' use of the word requires, rather than the verb means, implies that two are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. so when we're construing a provision in which the court has already recognized that, at least in some instances, congress' use of varying verbs to introduce the different subsections will be taken as significant 
do you have a position on justice alito's earlier question about whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is the same as the standard at the pleading stage?
 point 
all right. may  may i interrupt you there? and tell me if i understand the  the position in your brief correctly. i thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. and if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the  is the  is the agency itself. its bureaucracy is going to have less money. and i understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. is that your position?
you would say that's 
they came out together, right?
i would have assumed 
well, it applies to the report, but i submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in order to correct an error in the report, what he submits as the corrected report is then the, quote, report.
well, i  i would disagree with that on  on a couple of respects. the first is that the definition of commerce here is broader than it was and specifically refers to travel between the united states and foreign countries. the only other statute we're aware of that says that is title ii of the civil rights act of 1964. in addition 
i think that the cca's position and respondent's position is that almanza applies dually on direct review and post conviction, and that that's that's their explanation for why the state court didn't impose a procedural default on state habeas. and one of our views is even if you don't agree that under federal law this objection was inadequate, we believe that the state could not in effect change its mind about the adequacy of his trial objection only after this court summarily reversed its rule on the merits. and we think there are 
it certainly suggests that what  that what you're arguing is not essential to the state's enforcement of its alcohol laws.
if the person is on parole, the answer 
yes, your honor.
thank you, mr. lamken. the case is submitted.
and what the purpose of the charge filing requirement under title vii, as this court has repeatedly said, is to require that employee to come forward promptly within 180 days of the date that the alleged unlawful employment action is communicated to her, and bring that claim or lose it, that the purpose of section 706 was to create repose.
yes, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff. that's why you brought it up, i think.
they're  they're one more step removed. i don't know if they're one step removed. i mean, if there were no allegations of motive or family feud or targeting and all we know is that there are two competitors there and the one underpaid its taxes, is your case still viable?
but you agree you have to have that? you have to have some specific allegation to show of his knowledge? we can't just infer that?
they were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws 
you can't impose both. but the tribe is still imposing its tax, and it's getting every penny that it  that it purports to impose.
well, then suppose there are no other creditors.
 but there's nothing in the opinion to give any 
well, you still have a church of the holy trinity team over there somewhere, don't you? (laughter.)
but the  one problem is that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the facts in this very case differently. that is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. another might say it's  it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks. so the quantity is much larger. and he was in that sense a repeater, so i'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts.
maybe you could say then that it's the government that has the right. if it's the government that has the right, then government should have objected. i mean, the problem, of course, is obvious, that it's a little hard on the district judges that people come in and both sides tell them what you have to have here is a waiver. are you sure you won't raise this against me later? i'm positive. i swear. you mean you absolutely swear a thousand times that no matter what i do and have delay, you will never raise this as an error and it's fine? yes. okay? so he says, okay, fine, done. you win. then he raises it as an error. that's rather  called sandbagging the judge. and obviously, one would look to  or i would look to ways to avoid that, but you're telling me i can't avoid it, and that's what congress wanted and so be it. is that right?
and at least you have the authority of the international court of justice that says this is a right. this is not just a matter between the states.
all right, with that too.
i don't think complete bar means anything more than bar. res judicata is a complete bar and a statute of limitations is a complete bar. and i  i think the statute would mean the same thing without that word. and there's 
yes, yes.
because the other side's agreed. he won't object on the court of appeals. and suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the rule says 14.
i mean, all  all i'm getting it, is that's a different  that is a very different criterion from what we apply in strickland.
your honor, what schlup says is that we are to step back and see whether it is more likely than not that no  that any reasonable juror would vote to convict.
and i gather that the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that might arise in that case would be quite similar to the debate in the present context. in other words, there would be the same discussion between the different physicians about what emergencies arise and in what circumstances and whether that creates a problem and whether you can get to the courts in time and so on. it would be the same underlying sort of evidence that we have here, right?
no. i think you could certainly decide the case on the ground that an individual who has made no effort to utilize the grievance procedures that are available under the collective bargaining agreement, can't bypass those procedures entirely by filing suit into  in federal district court. and it wouldn't be necessary for the court to resolve 
right.
do you know of any instance of that?
 at is, did 
yes, your honor. this court can find  first of all, that the local democratic and republican parties were not named in  in the action, and as to why they were not in the action in lower courts i do not know. but the state has its interests and has to protect those interests whether those parties are involved in litigation or not.
if i'm with you so far, why would you suppose that congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?
although in most instances can marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized determination, which the missouri supreme court says does not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital punishment.
it could apply to some symbolic speech, i believe. it's just  i'm having trouble, because, in a practical matter, if you look at the record here, i think it's telling. if you look, at joint appendix, at pages 215 and 219, describes the real situation at boston college. and they want to say that, "well, it's not really much of an imposition on the military, because all you have to do is get the recruiting list from the reserve desk at the law library, and then go to" 
an aggravating factor means aggravating fact.
so 
i agree. but to say that  and they found  and i'm not suggesting that that's not part of the totality of the proceedings. but there's one significant point there that also i think needs to be taken into account. he was a witness, but he was also a drug dealer and involved in the drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these shurn families. and in many instances 
we don't have that evidence in the record. what we have is that we  the experts looked at total spending, which would include primary spending and general election spending, and our figures went from that. and our expert, by the way, considered all races, even those for which campaign finance reports were not filed, meaning that the candidate hadn't raised or expended more than $500, and assumed $500 in spending in each one of those  each one of those races. so our average spending figures actually might be a little higher than  than reality.
there is not. the only argument that was made in closing was that you can think about the others, which was clearly intended to go towards that reprehensibility analysis. you know, certainly in the criminal law context, an attempted crime is punished as badly as an actual crime when all the elements that official are required to, to accomplish that crime have occurred. and in the context of this very unusual long in duration misconduct, what you had to do was you had to look at that broad attempt to effect oregon 
may i ask one  have you read the brief of the former u.s. diplomats in the case?
and 
but was not making a rule for this case only. he was making a ruling of law.
 that's the piggybacking question. that's quite different. and 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
that 
well, there  there are big differences between the  the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and glacier monument. i think they're quite different.
that the object of the statute is to catch the outliers. and if you, for example, had one giant school district like new york city which was at the top of the list and another giant school district that was at the bottom of the list you would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half the pupils in the whole state, and those wouldn't be outliers would they? i mean, that's the problem.
but here, in the virgin islands and alaska, federal law requires that the taxes be imposed on the actual value. in the virgin islands it said your assessment will be actual value. that's why the term assessment was used in the virgin islands debt limitation, because that was in a preexisting federal statute that required assessment be an actual value.
he's a  he's a witness.
why wouldn't the same approach work the other way? the rule says 14 and the judge was wrong to give you more?
i can believe that they do 
because, first of all, if the indigent or the client still has representation, then there is no hindrance to the third party raising it themselves.
when you read the two in light of each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the purpose of the twenty-first amendment was to remove alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional matter, to prevent congress from tampering with it in the future, to give the judgement to the states as to 
no, but skip that. what about  you know, i was thinking precisely the same, but just with slight  if you get the letter back and you don't have the fedex rule, you either have to have the fedex rule or send a letter.
so you think blakely was not a new rule but booker was?
well, it  it's arguable except that mr. jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.
counsel, if i could get back to justice kennedy's question earlier, how do you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools, clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?
no but if you're thinking of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?
i suppose some  one answer to that case is the perez case, with loan sharking.
that's correct 
right. they don't have to principal activities. they're better understood as 
you acknowledge at least this much, or am i incorrect? and it's important for me to know that. you acknowledge at least this much, that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be saying that the court "must" do this so that the court was not really considering all factors in the exercise of its discretion, we would have to remand.
 in effect, it's the unbundling requirement which is your answer to justice scalia's  why should that make a difference? i mean, you could just as well make an unbundling requirement with respect to cable.
 this establishes a federal floor that states can go beyond if they want to assume more costs under the act.
it's, it's certainly possible. i don't think that that's a usual practice and i wouldn't advocate that here. and this is not a usual case in which the state has conducted an ordinary harmless error analysis. the state has actually in no way disparaged the power and extent of petitioner's mitigating evidence.
 because it isn't a big enough problem. but for  we're not talking about a whole system here. we're talking about 40 people or less, and if some of those 40 people want to get married, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no marriage?
and, by the way, my concern is not that it's a "bad thing," in quotes. my concern is that it's hard for me to think congress would have done something that wouldn't have had much effect.
the specific words were the  the 7 court's instruction that an  about a charge on all 8 ineligibility had to be supplied, and i'm going to quote 9 from the court's opinion where  where the prosecution 10 argues that the defendant will pose a threat to  to 11 society in the future. that  that opinion  and just a few lines 13 earlier it also said, again  and i'm going to quote the 14 words  if the prosecution does not argue future 15 dangerousness, the state may appropriately decide that 16 parole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration 17 even if the only sentencing alternative to death is life 18 in prison without the possibility of parole.
then it'll  then, presumably, if the state rejects it on that ground, if he tries to file in federal court, he'll get sent back for having failed to actually complete his exhaustion obligations until he manages to file a 
well, but that's your position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad because your  your position is the only reason is the census is  has  has caused there to be less than  than one man/one vote.
well, proceeding under 15, i  proceeding under 15, you would say to the state, "do you want to make a motion to amend?"
and i 
yes, your honor, i do 
kind of a weak law of gravity like the moon. it's only at one-seventh. (laughter.)
thank you, counsel.
are you familiar with the halbert case? you mentioned that there might be a finality problem in harris.
but congress has not directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of global warming.
an independent chain of events that almost certainly would have led to the discovery of the evidence despite  not without  despite the unlawful entry. and if that's so, all we have is a  is a set of cases where deterrence is most unlikely to play any significant role because no policeman could possibly count on that kind of thing getting the evidence in 
i think it matters because in a scenario like this, as opposed to either neder or  or the hypothetical, the only offense that has ever been litigated to the parties  or by the parties to the jury was the lesser offense. the parties understood that only the lesser offense was at issue, and we know that because in response to mr. recuenco's motion to vacate, the state told the judge you aren't required to give the firearm instruction because that's not an element of either the substantive charge or the enhancement.
how do  how do we  i mean, this was the problem i  i had with  with your  your brief here, and it's the same problem justice ginsburg has. what kind of weight, what significance do we give to this obligation to keep the government informed? on the face of it, it seems like a  an obligation that ought to get considerable weight. everybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got to pay real estate taxes on it. you're going to have a hard time doing that if they don't know where to send the bill, and so on. so it seems like a very reasonable obligation for the government to put on you. what weight do we give that in  in the analysis?
that is the second major advantage that we see to our rule, chief justice roberts.
there was a disagreement about whether or not his memorandum accurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was at issue there. there was a disagreement about the content of the allegations.
your honor, respectfully, i don't think that that's what the eleventh circuit thought. i think that that is an interpretation of the eleventh circuit's language. however, i think that where the phrase that counsel pointed to in the opinion  on page 5(a), referencing "obligation"  i believe that the court there was referring to, specifically under rule 4, that the court has this obligation. i think it  because it's in that discussion that the court is talking about the obligation. and i would submit that, indeed, under rule 4, in response, i believe, to justice  a point justice kennedy raised, i would say that, under rule 4, i think it is obligation. i think what rule 4 is, is a reflection of congress  excuse me  of the rule advising the court that, "you must exercise this authority that you already have at this particular time. this is the time when you need to be looking for these things."
well  well, they at least have to give, you know, realistic circumstances. they gave a few circumstances 
but that can happen when in fact the certification of the attorney general turns out to be wrong and there isn't any immunity. still, the whole thing is going to be tried in federal court.
well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim 
the problem with  with that theory is that congress has told us that the misrepresentation has to have caused the loss and 
but you would say that's outside 
 position was.
well, yes, except that the intangible sequence of commands can only be carried in the form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a bucket.
"and, if you don't, i'll revoke your"  i mean, the consent is not, in this case, first. i mean, california has said, the supreme court has said, parole, in the parole search condition, is imposed as a matter of law. your hypothetical poses a question of, could there be knowing and voluntary consent to a search if the consequence of refusing is revocation of parole? i would argue, in that situation, that the consequences of refusal are so dire that, effectively, the parolee would have no real choice but to consent. so, it would be, in a sense, a coerced consent.
no, justice kennedy, i don't believe you can because as many of the cases that this court has decided point out, those words are broad. they are the exact same language that the constitutional grant of article iii jurisdiction uses, and therefore, they have to be given content in some other fashion.
i  i believe so, your honor, given prison's unique environment.
i don't think so. it's like a law firm. it's like my law firm. when i join together with my partners, we may agree in our partnership agreement that each partner is going to have some control over what their billing rate is. as long as we have thrown our lot in together and as long as we're sharing the risks and loss of that activity  that may be a stupid thing 
mr. chief justice, we are not saying that it can't. we're  all we're saying is that it equally carries both meanings. school finance is an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely why congress left this issue to the agency to work this out. when congress  when congress used the terms 5 percent and 10 percent, and again i'm not, i'm not reading congress's mind to say that when congress used those terms, those percentiles, congress must have intended some national uniformity. this is a national program and congress expects these programs to be applied somewhat uniformly across  across the country.
that  in some sense, at the expense of the citizens in other states.
hartman is not statutory. some of the  hartman is the first amendment, and it's the bivens case. the point i was trying to make about that is that the court has a body of law trying to filter out through requiring proof of causation, requiring proof of substantial injury, filter out these trivial cases where someone is simply making a nuisance.
the rule the court  that it articulated in tinker. the rule of the court as articulated in tinker is that there is, in fact, a right to political speech subject to disruption, requirements that the speech not be disruptive.
all right. may i say one word about the tort of malicious prosecution, which i say is not a proper analog for the analysis of cases of this kind? the interests that are protected by the first amendment are far different from those that are remedied by the tort of malicious prosecution, and the injury to which is of far greater magnitude than what the common law sought to address by the tort of malicious prosecution. the tort of a malicious prosecution tells us nothing about the interests protected by the first amendment. it remedies different interests. it is not a proper analog and, therefore, shouldn't be involved in definition of what the first amendment rights may be. if you look at those cases where the court has referenced the common law in determining how constitutional rights should be remedied, they have been situations where the interests protected at common law are identical to those that are protected by the particular constitutional provision that is involved. a good example is wilson against arkansas, fourth amendment situation, the question of whether the knock-and-announce principle of common law should be incorporated into the reasonableness determination of the fourth amendment. the interest protected by the common law in that situation against unreasonable searches and seizures was identical to the interest protected by the fourth amendment. for that reason, the court said that should be taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of the action under the fourth amendment.
mr. hungar.
 did the same ratio for vermont. pardon me?
and what the state says is, "no, the eighth amendment requires no such thing." so, the issue hasn't gone away. it's still here. it's here in this very case.
why  why is that important, given what this petitioner did himself? he didn't wait for there to be a retroactivity decision to file the 2255 motion. he filed the 2255 motion before the ross case was decided. isn't that right?
can you tell us  let's assume for a minute that this case were on direct review, that we don't have aedpa. what is the standard that should control? whether there is an impermissible  an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be taken into account by the jury? is that the test?
well, i would respectfully say  official suggest that it does, your honor, because once  we don't really get to the eligibility question until the court below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar. we have to, as i say, we are in the process of objecting to claims and resolving them. now the 
have you ever done it?
i don't disagree with that, justice souter, but there's no special habeas retroactivity law. there is a special rule, under st. cyr, for habeas, but we amply satisfy that, because 
what is the particular difference between supporting the price and rigging the aftermarket? i mean, how do we tell that at the 12(b)(6)?
i believe the  the short answer to your question is  is yes.
no, there's no explanation. as a practical matter, though, the prospective 1996 legislation governs a wide variety of aspects of the  of the relationship between the federal government and the lessees. and, on balance, that package was pretty favorable to the oil companies, and i think congress official probably just decided not to  to apply that to itself, but not to the indians. getting back to the order, though, it's not only that 
but the "timely" question is still before federal courts. that's what we said in carey versus saffold. so 
there is a one-way ratchet here as there is whenever this court draws a constitutional line; that is, whenever this court determines that the constitution preempts the ability of legislatures to make 
that is the only stated reason, that he has been convicted. i think what that means is he's a twice convicted murderer. of course, he's dangerous. further, there are reasons spread upon this record. and keep in mind the same judge from the penalty phase retrial has been with this case from the beginning. there are reasons spread upon this record that justify additionally the use of restraints against mr. deck.
if you read the whole affidavit, you know it doesn't mean what it says there.
yes, and we think 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
we read the rule (b), the extension period 
why  why take it away from the 10 percent?
and that affidavit was not admissible because it's an affidavit.
thank you, ms. mahoney. mr. kester, you have 3 minutes remaining.
you have a much more limited point, as i understand it. your more limited point is simply that this is not clearly established law pronounced by the supreme court.
well, that's an interesting twist under washington law because the deadly weapon is  is actually two elements of assault two. under the substantive offense, it's a component of  of assault, and also an element of the  but to allege a firearm, it is possible that the substantive offense could have been elevated to assault one. it's also possible that it could have simply been an assault two with a firearm enhancement. so 
isn't  isn't your friend correct then? you are really trying to have your cake and eat it, too. you're saying if we did this without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. but you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to other people.
 perhaps it isn't 
 in a controlled substance 
that is correct. that is correct, justice kennedy.
"micro pigmentation" sounds awfully close to "micro color."
i mean ultimately, when all the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent would be the figure.
a safe harbor from an unknown standard. (laughter.)
i believe 
right.
 not the use of funds.
and what 
it said his rights in gonzaga v. doe, which dealt with the student privacy rights act, and we held  and the  we  the court held that that was  did not give rise to individually enforceable rights.
well, then if  if i understand the point you're making, it's a point of the  the  it's the hierarchy issue, if that's  if that's the point you're making.
i don't think the board has ever found that necessary to, to achieve diversity in the faculty.
 because there is no analogous statute.
then they promulgated a new policy and the new policy says nothing about it.
not with respect to the transferees, your honor, and it's true that the transfer policy certainly is more in jeopardy under the turner standard. but the  the overall policy of considering race when there is a  a lack of information certainly would pass the turner standard and should pass the turner standard as it was properly applied by the ninth circuit.
is there a difference in the moral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden on the jurors, in the situation where they have to find that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and, therefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to the sentence of death, as opposed to the situation where they can say, "we can't decide, under the applicable burden of proof, which side is weightier," and, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate what the sentence is going to be?
well 
 timeliness standards. and the way they customarily do that 
your honor, certainly that has been one of the emphases by petitioners, but the response to that is that the free aspect of the free appropriate public education does not give parents a substantive right to the education itself. we are not talking  we are debating in this case, the merits of this case, we are debating the a aspect, the appropriateness. we are not saying, we have not expelled the student and therefore they have a claim based on that. it is simply 
because they like to see these claims presented along with the appeal to be  so that they can possibly bring them together and decide habeas claims in light of the record on appeal. so, i think that's why they date it from filing of the reply briefs.
justice breyer, i do not know. i do know it is based in  in its explanation of its rule for all affirmative defenses, which would include insanity, which congress has rejected 
i don't think it  every  every competitor in the state of new york could sue because, as a practical matter, i  i submit to you that someone who lives in manhattan is probably not going to go to queens to buy their cigarettes. there are much 
the  the tax court judge certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a  on a report if he doesn't agree with it. if he doesn't agree with the tax court judge's view, he has the obligation, the ethical obligation  and we presume he follows it  to say i don't agree. this is my report. if you 
that's a misnomer that that's a  a right to payment. that is rather the right to borrow as a loan. and a loan is very different than a right to payment. they have the right to borrow the funds. however  for example, in the new york police department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. however, they  as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.
yes. that  that's the plaintiff's burden just like it's the plaintiff's burden to prove that they were terminated 
yes, your honor.
exactly. and that is precisely what 
did you  did you make the argument or the point that justice stevens articulated earlier about the  the provisions of this chapter not applying and that including 2676?
i think that the term racial balancing has two significant meanings. one is a plan that does not foster a compelling interest. and second, a plan that is too rigid, a quota, for instance, that might not pass narrow tailoring given the context. in this case we're not after a rigid set of numbers, and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers for their own sake. the purpose was to have schools that had become diverse through integration efforts not stray too far from the community's demographic because we're trying to prepare students to live in those communities.
well, i think they would have to make an allegation that the  that the ceo routinely is provided with that information rather than simply assume it. i think it's the same problem you have with their  with their allegation that it's common sense that ceos will act to protect their own personal self interest and the overall welfare of the company by misrepresenting the status of events.
i'm not entirely sure of the answer to the question, your honor, but i  i think, first of all, we look at compliance with state procedure.
no. i'm  in a way, i'm making it easy for you. i'm saying, look, they're  they're saying we think we can get a better deal for our party, but we are respecting these districting principles. equally illegitimate?
well then, in other words, the constitution of the united states prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are  that individuals who are in similar positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in similar ways. that to me is possible, but of course i've been in dissent in these cases. but it seems to me 
so we should be looking for one state or maybe two states at most.
there may well be an interstate impact.
and, in particular, why isn't he part of the common article 3 under the geneva convention, as judge williams found? that's part of the same question.
he says it in a footnote, and he says he was 
that's true.
 doesn't the president, in dames & moore, enter into an agreement with iran?
that court is not a common law court, is it?
 can opt out.
well, i don't know what you mean by "holding company," justice stevens.
justice ginsburg, i don't see that. that's certainly not true in this case. what i believe is true in this case is that but for my client's proactive litigation, this never would have come to the taxing authorities' attention. the taxing authorities are free to bring their own case. in our brief on the merits, in fact, we  we cited one case where the city of new york suing a different set of defendants over unpaid cigarette taxes. the point i want to make is that let us assume that the state of new york intervened in this case, which is always a possibility  perhaps it's a bit late now  or brought its own case. my clients and the state of new york are chasing two different piles of money, two separate measures of damages. in our brief on the merits, we set forth a hypothetical, a $100 cash transaction, to illustrate that. my clients cannot recover the lost taxes that were taken from the state of new york. the state of new york cannot recover the lost profits that my client suffered. so in  in the holmes sense, we're not dealing here with an apportionment problem because 
and that is a fact that was expressly considered by the california supreme court in appropriately applying boyde's general test for whether the jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an instruction that facially called for consideration 
yes, justice ginsburg. and that's exactly what this court should do. it should remand their statutory interpretation argument to the court of appeals to consider, for the lower courts to consider. this court deserves more than just a 20-page reply brief in response to 80 pages of briefing by the other side on an issue that was never raised below, not presented in the opposition to certiorari. remand would be the proper thing to do with respect to their claim. i do believe that is true, justice ginsburg.
and that 
that's right. and  and another important distinction, justice scalia, is that even if one could unearth a  a body of case law that recognized municipal immunity at the time of the founding, it would not become sovereign immunity, and that's the only issue that is  that is in contention here.
no, i'm sorry, i misunderstood your hypothetical. i thought your hypothetical was that if you bought, prior to the fraud 
yes, i do. where the petitioner claims that the patent is invalid, that they could  that the petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages their property value, potentially, and that they could bring a declaratory judgment action of validity.
well, as to the paid a higher price than necessary, the language we would suggest could be used in another case and passed on by this court, is the following: paid a higher price than necessary to move the log market to higher levels than otherwise would have prevailed in order to injure competition.
well, aedpa was enacted after 21 custis was decided and i think we presume that the 22 congress was aware of the precedent, but the 
 first get the piece of clothes? it's a fair question. the other side hasn't made any argument that it doesn't include the first wait, i think, because you're told that you have to don, it's part of your principal activity. let me also say, this, i think, is a somewhat academic question when it comes to  and nothing against academics, but the  it's a somewhat academic question when it comes to actual workplaces, because what happens is what i described before, the employers, under employers that are following our rule, do set up a time clock, and they say, "show up at 6:23, and that's when you can clock in." they have computerized swipe cards, and the computer won't recognize them until 6:23. and it's the time after that that will be compensable. so, if the court were to say the donning and doffing process starts and ends the workday for purposes of the portal act, everyone will understand what the 
why  why should we require a  a futile act in the name of reasonableness?
what criteria of race does the school, just out of curiosity, does the school district use? i mean, what if a particular child's grandfather was white? would he qualify as a white or non-white.
and the 
yes, justice o'connor, it is. the 
it's even worse, it seems to me. i mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial and so forth.
 solution that includes the substance dmt is covered, by definition, as i understand it. tea is a solution, and it includes dmt. isn't that the end of the issue?
i have two questions, if i may. one  of course, that wouldn't  the alibi evidence would already have been rejected, whether there was deliberateness or not, so that would not support putting in the alibi evidence. but the second question i have  i wanted to be sure we're clear on  - do you intend, on the future hearing, to introduce anything other than the transcript of the prior proceeding? do you intend to introduce live witnesses under  as you may, perhaps, be able to, under oregon law?
do you agree that if this case stands with the state system, we would have to accept their holding on the property right issue?
he had the alternative of  of having an inquiry with mr. nixon, with the court determine whether or not 
 it seems to me, overrides everything else. unless  unless you can persuade me that that  that that provision doesn't give the secretary the authority to  to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, i  i think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.
thank you, mr. feldman. ms. bergmann, you have 6 minutes remaining.
then i misunderstood your question, your honor. i am saying that they are separate categories. this court 
yes. yes, it does. but all the court addressed in givhan was the question of whether, if you take your concerns not publicly to the newspaper, but express them to the  in that case, the principal, that you don't lose first amendment protection. but the court did not address the question of whether those comments were within the scope of the employee's duties. and i think a reading of lower court's decision in givhan indicates that they were not. she was an english teacher, and she was commenting to the principal about employment practices at the school. that would not have been within the scope of her employment. and then 
not that i  if it is significant  if it is a significant limit on the officer's power to search and if it serves the other purposes of the particularity requirement, the measurement of the  providing the homeowner the notice of what is going on.
i suppose any private entity can choose its market. you're a market participant. you're saying, we're going to serve this class of consumers. that's your privilege. but what you do is you have a market participation which is sanctioned by the criminal law. you've built this trash utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you enforce use of that by the criminal law. so you're engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to enforce its use.
 you haven't asked for it, but the appellate court said, "we don't want to affirm a judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are going to"  there was  the judge was tipped off by the  by the directed-verdict motion, that the  who turned out to be  the one who turned out to be the verdict loser thinks the evidence is insufficient. that's enough at least to say that the court of appeals could grant a new trial.
if i could briefly sum up. in powers v. ohio, this court said that the fourteenth amendment mandate, that racial discrimination be eliminated from all acts and proceedings of the state, is most compelling in the judicial system. here, the district attorney struck two of three african american jurors, including both black women, where a black defendant was facing a sentence of 25 years to life in a three-strikes case for possessing .1 grams of cocaine. one of the reasons given by the district attorney is patently unconstitutional: gender. and all the other reasons are either contradicted or unsupported by the record.
may i answer?
well, i thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach.
but justice stevens, in the regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of these rules occ specifically addressed the question whether it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of national banks. and let's be clear. it's not that the occ previously had no authority over operating subsidiaries. the question is whether the occ has exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. and the occ determined in the regulatory materials that it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries 
yes, your honor. and it isn't all that unusual that the congressional history of a particular statute might point one way and the actual plain meaning point another way.
it is unclear from this court's decisions precisely what "legal incidence" means. at least it was unclear to me as i was looking through the court's decisions. but i think it's a combination of the liability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax, the fact that  in this case, the retailer has no liability for the tax. the only liability for the tax is on the distributor. the relationship is between the state of kansas and the distributor. and all of those factors together make it clear to me, from this court's previous decisions, that "legal incidence" is a term of art, especially in the field of taxation. and, as the court pointed out in the chickasaw nation case, it's important to have a 
i think it  i think it would not be feasible. it would  it would enmesh the department in difficult judgments and time-consuming 
if the district court learns about it he could be violated  he could be extradited back from mexico, and he could face up to a year more in prison.
well, there are many rights that are sacrificed. what the court has said about the fourth amendment rights is, because parolees have conditional liberty, they will have a reduced, but not eliminated, fourth amendment protection 
justice kennedy, i don't think that's a reason that it is an abuse of discretion to fix that error. the state makes a  a lot of an issue in their reply brief of a fact that the court of appeals should have gotten this right the first time. that is exactly why we have reconsideration. that is a quintessential illustration of why reconsideration is a good idea. the court should have gotten something right the first time, didn't, recognizes its error, and while it still has jurisdiction over the case, fixes that error. i think far from showing it's an abuse of discretion
 mr. stris. ms. chatman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
then we better not do anything for the first time. (laughter.)
absolutely not. we only knew about sims. we asked for records regarding all the executions since sims. we have not received it.
that's correct.
which would be more burdensome? that enactment or subjecting municipalities nationwide to damages? which would be more intrusive and burdensome on federalism 
well, the ada itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable. i mean, you could certainly lean on that because a structural change probably isn't readily achievable.
well, let's take the one, that  that one. are you saying no attorney's fees there because you couldn't get them at the fcc, therefore you shouldn't get them in court?
counsel, you have  you have two questions presented. the second is whether this was sufficiently  sufficiently exigent to fall under the exigent circumstances. but the first was whether the test should turn on the officer's subjective motivation. i haven't heard much about that this morning. how is that presented on these facts?
and so the triggering 
is there any aspect of state law, including liability limitation, that they want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary chartered under state law, michigan or another state, and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state regulations?
 on a case by case basis.
well, your honor, i think one thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of global climate change. i think the debate is on which areas are more uncertain than the others. but certainly i think the agency was entitled to conclude, particularly if you take into account the deference this court should give to that kind of determination, that the scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change, surrounding issues of the extent of natural variability in climate, surrounding the issues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean circulation, and low cloud cover, are permissible considerations for the agency to take into  
yes.
 immediately said, "no, he doesn't want to talk to us. he already asked for a lawyer. we cannot talk to him now" 
well, with all respect, the oregon supreme court did not say residual doubt was admissible. and residual doubt was never argued to the trial court, to the oregon supreme court; and, therefore, whether or not it can come in 
yeah.
i think it is. i mean, they're 
mr. feldman, it doesn't count as badgering, or the equivalent, that the police  the  walk in, and they present not only the charges, but they present the application for the charges, which shows that the co-perpetrator had talked to the police, talked his head off, and put all the blame, at every step on the way, on this defendant? that did weigh heavily in the trial judge's mind.
well, i think most courts have held that where you have suspension with pay, then you don't have material adverse employment action. now, at some level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a year, then effectively you could have a different type of material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week suspension to investigate, that would not be material adverse action. in fact, as  as the afl-cio amicus brief points out, i think, that's the favored practice in the industry. now, we  we do think that with respect to the standard, that as this court recognized in faragher, it makes good sense to harmonize discrimination standards. and here, we think that congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard for section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with the standard for section 03, the act's core prohibitions. justice scalia, it does  the section 704 does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment, but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is reasonable to read the discriminate against as a shorthand for the unlawful employment practices identified in section 703. it's also important to keep in mind that congress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation statute when it wants to. look at the ada, the family medical leave act. these are statutes which, by their terms, prohibit employers from any attempt to intimidate, coerce, threaten, or interfere with the exercise of rights. look at the family medical leave act 
exactly. exactly. and here the order 
we're not asking for that bright line rule, your honor. it could well be the case that providing kosher meals, for instance, whether that's required by the free exercise clause or not, it might go marginally beyond what free exercise requires. that's an accommodation that would be perfectly legitimate. but to have a rule that says anytime you bring any request of any kind for an accommodation from any rule, it's going to be treated differently and better because it's religion 
but coming here, i would have thought our rules say that if you're going to rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, we should see it in the brief in opposition.
well if anything the language of the westfall act is broader because as your honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the westfall act provides that the attorney general is to certify that at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose the employee was acting within the scope. so arguably the necessary question is what was the employee doing at the time. the federal officer removal statute is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.
yes. well, you 
everyone at trial understood that the special issues on the verdict form were unalterable, that texas law required the legislature to specify what was on the special verdict form. what the trial court invited counsel to do was to offer a different form of nullification in the supplemental instruction that would then interpret the special issues. this court's opinion in its summary reversal made plain that the problem with nullification instructions is broad and intractable and applies to all nullification instructions.
no, your honor.
and was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?
yes.
you have 30 seconds. you want to say how irresponsible that is, right?
 asserted by 
is that right?
of the second judgment? official
the abuse of discretion standard absolutely would vary depending on the facts and circumstances of a case. and if it appeared that a particular exercise of rule 41(b) power was contrary to aedpa, it would surely be an abuse of the court's discretion.
 that question to be a jurisdictional question, as far as the lower court is concerned; and, therefore, i think it's a jurisdictional question for us.
it has to be reason to inquire.
the government doesn't dispute that as in this  as this court held in wheat, there's a presumption in favor of counsel of choice. every court has rules that govern how lawyers are to enter their appearances and represent defendants, and district courts can make 
they write it down, just what i said.
i think the only thing he could 
well, it does obligate immediate notification to the defendant, doesn't it?
thank you ms. mahoney. the case is submitted.
but, mr. kneedler, may i 
but it doesn't  it doesn't talk about personal injury that  that broadly. it talks about the right to make and enforce contracts. that's the portion of it you have to be relying upon. it doesn't talk about 
where does this term come from as applied to a rule of decision? i mean, when somebody is arguing that the treaty should apply a rule of decision in a case brought under some other cause of action, what's the best thing i could read? i'm not an expert.
 you'd be 
why?
a potential risk 
well, that's quite different from saying that it's  that it's valid. so i think they acknowledge that  that a lawsuit against an officer who knowingly dispenses with  with knock and announce because, as you say, he says there's  there's no consequence, but there is a consequence. he can be sued.
but that's something  where would we  we would just pick that number, that 
that's not my understanding. i may be wrong. but, as i read section 3410, the distributor must file monthly reports with the state describing the amount of tax it's drawn down at the rack when it takes the  unloads fuel into its trucks. and it's responsible monthly 
so the, so the  but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial statement in the cole case cuts against you.
i understand that. i'm asking a factual question.
yes.
as  as the chief justice suggested i think anybody from a different denomination that said that this was discriminatory probably could bring a claim. i also think that anybody who walked into one of those churches could bring a claim. and again, this court  this court 
 it seems to me a perfectly reasonable line.
congress described the need that there be some relationship between the consequences of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed to be addressed by taking the drug. if they didn't use the word "efficacy," what word did they use?
the constitution requires 
well, what about in this case, which is justice ginsburg's question? if the police said, we have reasonable grounds to  to believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds for knocking  for not  for dispensing with the knock requirement?
it's hard to have three different kinds of standards with attorneys-fees statutes. i mean, there are quite a few of them, and  i can understand saying some of those statutes mean you almost always should get it, because of special policies reflected in the history of the statute, et cetera. that's christianson. and i can imagine fogerty, where you say, "as to an ordinary one, it's ordinary." "ordinary" means it's up to the discretion of the district judge. and there may be many reasons. do we want a third one, where 
it was not a false exercise, your honor, until october 30 of 2004. at that time congress spoke. and what that 
that's right. and 
okay.
but those could be  those could be dropped out of the federal complaint. there you're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your discretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted these, he should have gone immediately to do that. but what about the other four?
i don't think general passion is enough. i think what the court said is there has to be a tie-in, and let me say that i think what's critical here is any test obviously is susceptible to hypotheticals, but the government  our test at least keeps in taxpayer standing the core of what the framers were worried about, which is government expenditure of funds 
but  but here's  here's the fly in the ointment. you  you interpret tributary to include storm drains and ditches that only carry off rainwater. i mean, it makes an immense difference to the scope of jurisdiction of the corps of engineers. i mean, when you talk about adjacent to a tributary, i think, you know, maybe adjacent to the missouri river or something like that. no. you're talking about adjacent to a storm drain.
what are the consequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical trial without the approval of the fda?
what's the purpose of the causal connection requirement? what's the reason for having it?
that may be, but as a matter of washington law, that's not the case. and it may defy common sense, but that's what it does.
mr. tribe 
you can only buy my windshield if you buy the windshield wipers with it. am i no longer selling a windshield because i'm selling it with  only with windshield wipers?
why, if we  if we agree with you on the hobbs act, i assume you would not have us reach that third question this time, either.
i hope not.
ms. forsman, what about the cases we're had so far on this second teague category? as far as i know  well, we haven't found anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far, so this would be the first time.
it certainly  yes, your honor, i will concede it's a different kind of inquiry. but i  i do think, though, here the categorical exclusion of small businesses is a clear indication of congressional intent of what congress wanted to have happen.
general clement, are not some of the findings by congress clearly erroneous? for example, there is a statement that no current medical schools provide instruction in the procedure. now that's clearly wrong, isn't it?
and i also believe that a stay under these circumstances is appropriate under the statutes, section 2254 and 2244, and is consistent with those statutes. there is nothing, as justice souter noted in his concurrence in duncan v. walker, that prohibits the  the granting of a stay under circumstances such as these. indeed 
but you are back  as justice breyer pointed earlier, you're making the prosecution prove two crimes instead of one.
how do you  how do you police that, though? because an incumbent can  has so many opportunities to go before the public that wouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but as part of his or her official duties, while everything a challenger does is going to be credited against his account.
because we think of costs as really a matter of course. as justice scalia points out, it says "just costs," which  i take it "just" modifies just the cost and not the actual 
bless them, your honor. (laughter.)
but she, she could have  if she had been there at the deadline, the child would have been admitted to  if she had been there in march instead of august?
you  even if you read it that way, it still says, comma, because of age, and the because of age is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of that, justice breyer, is the defense that you keep pointing to because as mr. goldstein conceded in his brief and as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is based on. that is also a reference to intent. this statute is preoccupied with intent. what section 4(f) was about was identifying the situations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless, wouldn't even be arbitrary 
i know it is but what is your view?
well, sometimes.
you don't  you don't dispute the application of the inevitable-discovery principle here, do you?
why would you need the 8 placeholder if the rule were, as judge black said it 9 should be, that if you go to the state court within the 1 10 year after your federal conviction becomes final, then the 11 time that you are in the state court the statute will be 12 tolled? if that's the rule, then you don't need any 13 placeholder filings.
yes, you 
is there any 
well, this court has never approved restrictions on fundamental first amendment values based purely upon speculation or concern about something that's happening some other place. in other words, these are real limits on people in vermont, and it seems to me that to approve the lowest contribution limits in the nation and these very low expenditure limits, the state would have to demonstrate that vermont is the most corrupt state in the nation. and they're far from it. in fact, the opposite 
why do we need the question of the relationship, which justice stevens's questions raised, even to arise if  if the principal criterion is going to be economic non-tax purpose?
justice 
no, absolutely not. it's  it's that it's  it's that it's wanton and  and gratuitous pain.
no. they were separated.
 when the thing is tied up.
may i ask this question about the laddering and so forth? if it were fully disclosed, would it be unlawful under either statute.
well 
why isn't that already in the record in the ninth circuit, in the second circuit and in the eighth circuit, in the district courts, proceedings in those circuits?
so in the normal course when you have a district court decision, a trial court decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done. so you have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace else until that judgment is entered. i think that's the essence of your argument, isn't it?
there were cases  we don't have to deal in hypotheticals. there were cases where this happened, where people ended up liable for a tax greater than what they took in. what happened in those cases?
yes, but 
page 282 of the joint appendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands for. dr. blake testified it is incomplete penetration, which i haven't the foggiest idea what that means.
maybe civil rights actions where there's a federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? i guess that would be 
but the triviality issue would be out of the case. no matter how trivial, it goes to a jury. that's  that's what you want us to say.
you had your chance to show it.
obviously, in  in doing these things, there's a practical side on  on the business side when they work these things out. but the reason that claim would settled for $100,000 again speaks to the strength of their claim for other kinds of damages.
no, you would have been right, justice breyer. we're not asking  even the louisiana public service commission is another example of something. and that brings me  i think i should go back to what 
there are really two kinds of batson problems as i see it. there are some cases where the prosecutor is  just is deliberately keeping african americans off the jury, and there  there's no question there's a violation there. but i'm wondering if there isn't another category where persons are unconscious of their own subconscious bias and not realizing that they themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an african american might not be a sympathetic juror. would that kind of failure to really identify the problem within the prosecutor's own conception of the case  would that be a batson violation in your view?
well, mr. lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it? i mean, it's  it's more spare.
that is correct, and i'm  and, justice ginsburg, that's why telephonic warrants are simple and easy, one of the many alternatives to anticipatory warrants, which do not require any 
the internet  is it  you would have said four years ago, or i think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. okay. they're in now, they're big, and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the other profit, while the internet little company comes in and says i can get it to you cheaper. now i can imagine circumstances like you say. i can imagine they're not like you say. i don't know. and so what should i do if i really don't know?
well, i think 
 their statement in their  in the certiorari  this is the government's statement. this is the department of justice's concession that blue cross has sole authority over reimbursement decisions, and that is their language. that's the way they describe 
under washington law, when a court  as i think is common under federal law, whenever a court interprets a statute, determines what it means, that is what the statute has always mean  means, and  and that is what that statute will mean in the future until such time as the legislature amends it. as of this date, while the  the legislature has amended the statutes at issue in hughes, it has done nothing with respect to this statute. so, as it stands now, based on the recognition of the washington supreme court that at the time of the entry of that decision, there was no provision to submit that question to a jury in mr. recuenco's case. there was also no provision to submit it to a jury in another case because prior to recuenco, the only means by which the firearm enhancement could be obtained was pursuant to the decisions in meggyesy, rai, and olney. and that was the very manner that was used here, and that was the very procedure that the washington supreme court found violative of blakely.
no, your honor. we don't believe our client has ever defamed mr. cochran. we believe that all of his speech is just opinion.
well, why isn't it, at that stage if he doesn't get into court, you then say that that isn't true? they should be able to come to court in other instances as well, making the same kinds of arguments that you're making now.
no, your honor, ratification is not presented squarely in this case. the only question that's at issue in this case is whether or not, regardless of whether the transactions that took place between 1795 and 1838 were legal or illegal, and we've argued that they're legal in other cases 
 wasn't available.
which question, justice breyer? i'm sorry.
yes. ms. neaves.
to  to  there are 41 states that require parental consent below 18.
i want to hear your answer to the question that if i agree with you that on non-constitutional matters, if this system doesn't work for your client, he gets review in a federal district court. suppose i agree with you on that. what is the argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy that is there, namely a request for arbitration 
what  what's wrong with the argument that when you're dealing with a void contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the state policy is that you don't enforce any aspect of it? i mean, if you and i had, you know, a contract for murder and it had an arbitration clause, it's pretty strange to send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that contract as opposed to saying that the contract as a whole is void.
well, i  i think that that's a  a fair interpretation of one possible understanding of their brief, justice kennedy. i don't think that it matters for this court in deciding this case whether there was discussions by the owners of the joint venture earlier than the time of september of 1998 whether they were going to unify the prices or not. the  the important point for this court is that this was an efficiency-enhancing joint venture. the ninth circuit didn't question that. and that in an efficiency-enhancing joint venture, it is entitled to set the prices of its product, whether it decides to do it 8 months after the venture is in operation or 2 months before, as long as what they're doing is setting the prices of the products of the venture itself.
well, because there's been no hearing. we've never gotten past is this  can you open the door through 1983, and i  i still don't understand what your answer is to my question. now, i'm supposing that we do have the 1983 hearing, and the judge says, yes, i agree with the petitioner's experts. in some cases there will be excruciating pain. then you say, but, judge, they haven't come up with an alternative.
is that 
that was the intent, obviously, for those released.
thank you, ms. smith.
justice breyer, neither party made that argument. this issue came up in a letter that was written after. the  the language 
can that 
listen. my question is a simple one. if it's  it seems to me, if it's  what you're saying is, if it is either a felony under federal law or a felony under state law, you get the enhanced sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?
no, your honor. the better screening device is in rule 15(c)(2). as mentioned, rule 15(c)(2) is the provision that determines whether or not a claim is time-barred. and 15(a), then, can determine whether or not the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred.
okay.
so you say we're all stuck with 5 that.
so your  your thesis that it applies to just accusatory statements to a law enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.
well, in 
and  and that isn't then on the basis of age. am i right? is that  that was the problem the court had below.
how does the fact that it's sole proof mean that it's testimonial?
may i detract you just for a moment? on  on a question of the statutory history, correct me if i'm wrong, but originally, 1934, the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh priority claim. and then in '38, congress said no priority at all covering workers' compensation. and then when congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it up to four or five, depending upon which version of the statute we use. is there any explanation why, when congress originally assigned first a very low priority and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a par with the fringe benefits?
no, it didn't have the same elements, but there's no reason to think that the difference in the elements 
mr. castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in delaware?
there is a bankruptcy clause, your honor, and that clause empowers congress to make bankruptcy laws which apply throughout the entire nation and which apply to the states. however, the bankruptcy clause does not authorize congress to abrogate the state's sovereign immunity from suit. when  while abrogation can be accomplished using other provisions, it cannot be accomplished using the bankruptcy provision.
well, we're past that. when she didn't get the assignment that she requested for her son 
we don't 
let's assume i don't agree with you about that. now 
i think what  you look at  the relevant factors are the factors that go to whether a reasonable person would understand that questioning was going to stop. this court has said that there were two 
how do we know that? i was looking at, what is it, 13-a? how do we know that that charge is as a principal? in the appendix to the petition.
your honor, as a matter of 
well, fine.
and  and so you say there's  there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding of what that decision means.
and it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts.
 suggesting 
thank you, mr. pincus. mr. hungar, we'll hear from you.
justice ginsburg, what we're saying is that congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was stating that the federal courts should give deference to the state court decision so long as it is a merits decision and so long as it complies with existing clearly established law and is not unreasonable. and if that occurs, then congress under 2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under those circumstances.
no, that's not right, justice breyer.
but there is good reason 
but you  if the plaintiff 
i think it is. it's protected both by the sources and method provision, and i think revelation of a source could implicate the  the criminal prohibitions in the statute as well. and i think that this statute  i think you can see the extent to which this  this case implicates the core of the secrets that the agency has. this court in the sims case described the sources and methods protected by the statute as the heart of the intelligence community.
with respect to any interest of travelers?
i didn't say 
what about the decision that said ring v. arizona was not retroactive on collateral?
may i ask you 
i'd 
and then sometimes it's impossible to complete the exhaustion. i assume in some cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have expired, right?
this is very different from those kinds of export bans. those export bans did one of two things.
that suit was brought under the apa, and the district brought the suit on that basis.
well, and we think that that position that they have advanced in this court is incorrect, and i would agree with your postulate that what the federal district court does and it has jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does apply, to dismiss it.
 they're both purchasers. they're dealers, in my hypothesis. each of them buys a hundred cars a year, and one of them pays a higher price than the other, and they're in the same relevant market 
it was  it's clear 
 section 7. okay. second, in citizens publishing, the lawfulness of the joint venture, like here, even if you posit that the joint venture is lawful, it  the pricing must be  must be necessary in order to achieve those  those savings in order to be justified. when there's no connection, it's just a straight, naked restraint, and even if it were  even if the joint venture were lawful here, even if that were so and they had all these cost savings, in the face of all of those lowered costs and the lowest crude oil and the excess supply, they not only took the price leader and the price cutter, they brought them to the same level, and then they increased the price another 67 percent in major markets 
because if  if discharge of the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an acquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an acquittal.
how so?
well, you could  you could have, i guess, what i refer to as the dickerson v. united states phenomenon. it could come up. but what's  what's really interesting  i think what's 
can't you make that argument about any, about cross-examination in general? it is debatable whether  how good cross-examination is in determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony. now, our constitution decides the issue one way, but any infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible to the same argument that you are making.
your honor, first of all, i do think we have special standing. for example, here it's uncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make ozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to comply with our existing clean air act responsibilities. and the  in the west virginia case, which is a d.c. circuit case, the court found that that itself provided an independent source of standing. in terms of supreme court cases, the  it's been  for 200 years, this court has recognized loss of state sovereign property as a traditional 
that is not a 
well, i'm not talking about anything fancy like colorado river. prior action pending is a familiar defense. you've got two actions. they could even be in different districts of the same state and one says, your honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a prior action pending. that's not colorado river abstention or anything like that.
do you have any  any authority either in the text of the constitution or in a  a case for the proposition that the only reason a legislature can reapportion its districts is because there's been a census?
well, they have an  they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both california and federal law, as well as the 
one reason to require total exhaustion is because, i would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward with litigation. but i guess that's only true if the exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those typically claims that are not going to be available or are they claims that may generate relief once there is exhaustion?
 the national law journal. all of those he could get.
the  what we know is that  that is correct, mr. chief justice, with the following clarification, that the office action, as mr. minear has indicated, represents a  an initial judgment by a staff member in the office. and what  what is quite  and it is  doesn't represent even the pto's final judgment in the case, but what is really revealing here is that reexamination is a process that was invoked by ebay. and as we point out in our brief, typically if a competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the pto to reexamine it when it first learns about it. ebay not only didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265 patent at least 24 times years before. it then came to mercexchange and offered to buy it.
it can, your honor, but it needs to be a probable cause determination that is actually communicated to the holder of the restraining order, whether it be a favorable or adverse determination, there needs to be some notice provided to the holder of a restraining order of what the police officers intend to do.
because the length of the sentence counts heavily in the attorney general's assessment, is that 
thank you, mr. thomas. mr. newsom.
what  justice scalia, i think the strongest statement is in the valley forge case, at page 489, where the court said, "if respondents have no  the argument that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing." this would convert "standing" into a requirement that must be observed only when satisfied. but the fact is that under any standard articulated by this court in its article iii cases, the respondents here do not having standing. the effect of the tax is very "uncertain, hypothetical, or speculative," to use the words of this court, with respect to them. they cannot demonstrate that they are affected by it. and as 
yes, your honor.
if that attempt  if that method were attempted, mr. casey would undoubtedly argue that the attorney would not be entitled to any funding because the attorney was never appointed. you can't just go out and find indigents that you would like to represent. you have to be formally appointed.
i think that's right, justice ginsburg.
i don't think the question is what mr. frederick intended. the question is what a reasonable observer would think. and the words "bong hits" are slang that would be particularly, have a particular characteristic of getting across to other student, and they suggest a casual tolerance and encouragement of 
i thought that  it looked to me that's what they were trying to do in black. i mean, in a way, it is kind of the  the black opinion, the day after, if this court were to agree with you, and the california supreme court issued a decision looking a lot like its decision in black, that would be perfectly valid. in other words, saying that judges can depart within this whole  just like booker, they can depart within this whole range, and we're going to review their determinations for reasonableness. they don't have to impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. that would be perfectly all right.
that is what we're saying, your honor, because the effect on the state of tennessee is precisely the same. the finality is the same. the judgment was  was entered and final at the point that the court entered it the first time in january of 2003.
if the contract 
on the one hand, the indians have to pay the tax. okay, that's true. and it's harder for them to impose their own tax. that's true of every upstream tax. and it goes for roads that they use all the time. and they just have a one-and-a-half mile  and why shouldn't they be treated every  like everybody else, when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for? so, the balancing works in their favor. now, what's your response?
which  which you agree does no good at all. right?
i  as i indicated, i don't believe bacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of those cases. but 
it seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't  they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
i'm sure that's the case with regard to other medical procedures, if you're grossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, i'm sure, in most states.
did  did she wait until after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she  she have the police on the way after the first minute?
is there normally a statement of reasons for the denial of relief or are they just denied in many cases?
 up to the point where you say it went as far as it possibly could. as justice scalia indicates, why didn't it say, "this is the way the act must be interpreted," period? so, it didn't go as far as  i'm just quibbling with your  i'm just quibbling with your statement that it went as far as it possibly could. i don't think it did. that's the problem.
yes.
oh.
and the reason  this is a reason i think the washington supreme court took note of the fact of what the funds were spent on, on balloting initiatives solely, not on candidate elections.
okay.
it cited  i thought cited knapp and  which, in turn, cited gray or  or 
and i don't know why he wouldn't.
and what i'm saying now, your honor, is that he can't just wait and not file.
may i return to fogerty for a minute? as i read the footnote at the end of the opinion, which you - because say referred to the third circuit rule, it talks about, "nonexclusive factors are permissible." it doesn't say the factors used by the third circuit are the  you know, set any particular standard. as i read it, it leaves the discretion entirely up to the district court to apply whatever reasonable and appropriate factors seem correct in the particular case.
the conduct is 
and he may well be, your honor, but what 
that may be a concern, justice kennedy, but the cole case provides a particular example of how defense counsel countered that argument. 75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141 and 144 of the cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that argument is that cole will burn out as he grows older, and that's based on the testimony of his experts. and he says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not be dangerous is a reasonable one.
well, i don't know if that's a  if that's a detailed enough hypothetical. i mean, if the employee's core job duties are to report x, y, and z, and that employee goes out to the public and reports x, y, z, e, and f 
a person who runs in illegally, a person who crosses the border illegally, say, from mexico is entitled to these rights when you catch him.
then our position is, it gets past step one, because it's not normally something that a prosecutor is required to do, and it would be subject to a balancing 
well, in 
it is sometimes.
the statute doesn't 
i don't know. if they're right, good for them. right? you  you  they ought to strike them.
why would congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not? i mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?
mr. cole, are you sure that this statute doesn't go beyond pre-smith  our pre-smith law? i'm not aware that our pre-smith law would have defined religious exercise as broadly as this statute defines it. i guess this is something mr. clement ought to speak to as well. it says, the term religious exercise includes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief.
 and that is to reinforce this. our position is that the computer inquiries and the at&t mfj had definitions: what's a basic service? what's an enhanced service? congress adopted those for the purposes of the definition of a "telecommunications service" and an "information service." now, you can make policy judgements about how to regulate, although you're going to have to do it under the forbearance regime adopted in a response to justice scalia's opinion for the court in mci. but, nonetheless, the definitions are what they are. this is a statute that's being interpreted. so, let me come back. so, what did the commission say under those definitions? at&t would be able to avoid computer ii and computer iii unbundling and tariff requirements for any basic service that it could combine with an enhanced service. you know, we've got the telecommunications, like we're going to tack e-mail onto it. this is obviously an undesirable and unintended result. the d.c. circuit, faced with precisely the same question under the framework that congress intended to adopt, that is on the next page, on page 25, right below the block quote. the block quote sets up the problem. the d.c. circuit, however, rejected that conclusion, the one that's being proposed here by the commission, as a strained interpretation of the language of the decree that could not have been intended because it would allow the bocs to, quote, "create an enormous loophole" in the core restriction of the decree. so, justice o'connor, this comes back to your point in the first half of the argument, and that is, it becomes completely circular. if the point is that you will only be subject to common-carrier regulation when you decide to provide telecommunications service, nobody ever will. everybody will always bundle.
but the rate regulation is  is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires. and 276 is something quite different.
 to decide to search the person when he's in the men's room or something. i mean, there are 
i think what you're saying, though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions to make sense. surely that's a sound principle, isn't it?
well, no, the 
your honor, if his company fired him because he couldn't make contracts  in other words, they said, we  we don't want you to be our ceo. we don't want a black ceo because, after all, we're going to lose business with these other companies  then i think under an interference theory, that he probably could sue under 1981, sue both his company and also the third party that induced the interference. if we look to common law principles, the common law of tortious interference established various rules that were designed to provide recovery for interference when the causation was sufficiently direct, and the common law says  this is section 766 of the restatement and cases that follow that  that, in essence, if the third party  or if the defendant induces the breach, essentially, you know, tells them, this is how we want it done, we want you to fire so and so if you want our business, if they induce the breach or induce the violation, then they can be liable as well.
they 
well, it's also an independent statement and allegation on information and belief, which is permitted under rule 8, that there is agreement.
well, the unique circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.
well, that was at a time before the aedpa enactment that tried to put limits, time limits, on these things.
i'm sorry?
may i go back to your point a few minutes ago about  it was, sort of, a categoric point  you, in effect, said, "if this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them." wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? that in deciding what class you are going to  or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, "what good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?" in this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits  whether you accept the evidence is another thing  but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. there's no such argument, i would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. and, for that reason, isn't there a  isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?
yes, your honor. and compelling state interest doesn't present a problem to the state of ohio or to the other states that are operating under this statute. what it  what presents the problem is the least restrictive alternative part of that which subjects state prison officials in their day-to-day judgments regarding prison operations to a strict scrutiny analysis on the back end.
no problem.
in 2.a, 2.a calls for a different type of comparison. and i also note that in 2.a it refers to percent instead of percentile, which refers to two numbers being compared. percentile refers to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are somewhat different. now we're not, i'm not contending that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues is a broad enough term.
your honor, again, waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly. now, let's 
well, but you say directly related. that  that assumes the very point that i have in mind. i don't know why it's directly related.
who said?
 for this case.
well, justice breyer, it's because of the addition of the anatomical landmark language to the federal statute.
mr. dreeben, how many  how many states are we talking about for these 51 individuals involved in the case? how many different states?
you could have brought one.
mr. smiland, can i ask this question? if justice breyer is  the thrust of his question is right, i  i think the district itself could not have brought the suit under his reading of the sovereign immunity. and i'm just wondering, has the united states ever taken the position that the district could not have initiated this litigation?
justice o'connor, the lower courts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that (a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in it, does apply to compensation and 
 school districts can initiate. the second situation is in  is where children act up in the classroom. the school  the statute places restrictions on how the school district can discipline a child if the school district determines that the misbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability. in that situation, if the  if the school district believes that more severe discipline is warranted than would be allowed under the statute, the school district has to initiate the hearing in order to get an alj to allow it to take more severe action. and the third situation is where the school district disagrees with a parent's request for an independent educational evaluation. parents can request, as part of the developmental process of an educational plan, to have an independent educational evaluation conducted on their child, paid for at public expense. most of the times, that's conducted without incidence. in some situations, if school districts believe that that expense was not warranted, they could initiate a proceeding. and in all those cases, we acknowledge that  under the traditional rule, that the complaining party, the party that initiates the action and seeks relief, bears the burden of proof in that proceeding.
right.
yes.
yeah. yeah. yeah. and then russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or isn't followed a lot.
but, justice ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call ocr.
well, that goes to the heart of this case, justice souter, in the kind of regulations that we have. what we have here is not the fcc telling long distance providers to give pay phone operators money that long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators. the money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per call is the money that callers owe the pay phone operators. if you look back at the d.c. circuit's decision 
 of the 
and that's in the portion of the opinion that's dealing with discrete employment action. it's not in the portion of the opinion dealing with sexual harassment claims. i'm trying to answer your question about which portion of morgan pay claims fall into.
the prosecutors were contacted during that period, but the questionnaires 
well  but  [laughter.]
well, i  i believe it does call for a timely objection by somebody to say something, rather than to just sit back and let it expire, knowing that someone did something that they should not do in connection with 
i don't know whether he had a primary or not.
he ties it to that. he says, i just disagree with the california legislature as to whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from committing this kind of a crime. and look  and he cites another state which provides a much higher sentence for the same crime. can that possibly be unreasonable?
yes.
exactly.
uh-huh.
he, he's raised to it that extent as to that particular piece of mitigation. and the trial court is expressly saying i disbelieve you when you say you would have allowed presentation of that mitigation.
and 
 of parole.
no 
because 
apparently florida didn't think it was too short.
no. i'm saying how many are on the other side?
at any rate, they could not have been making the distinction justice scalia suggested if, at least in the court's thinking, the tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.
 entitled to apply for these forms of relief from deportation, then he will  then he can become an american citizen, or become a lawful permanent resident, as a result of the forms 
i think the short answer to that, your honor, is that there are a lot of antitrust cases that are filed that aren't successful, and there's no reason to believe that just because a plaintiff files a case, that it is going to be successful. and, in fact, establishing a rule that the filing of the case meets an element is  is a bit of an attractive nuisance.
i don't deny that. i  i'm not taking a position on whether, you know, a state wants to allow it, or not. i'm just taking a position on whether it was envisioned by congress, in 1971, that accepted medical practice would include prescribing drugs to help somebody end his life. and i don't think it  i don't think it would have occurred to congress.
through the supremacy clause, your honor.
with respect, justice souter, i don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the suspension clause argument. i mean, in st. cyr, it's worth noting that this court addressed the specificity with which the statute applied separately from the retroactivity question. here, to take the first question first, there's no question, this wolf comes as a wolf. congress was going after 2241. it clearly did that. all of e(1) 
i think you're making an argument that it would preclude that too.
thank you, mr. joseph. mr. frederick, you have nine minutes remaining.
and if you don't know someone, then it's not murder? (laughter.)
then i believe that this court's opinions indicate that that would not be a waiver with respect to the different transaction or occurrence. certainly, by filing the proof of claim you would expose yourself to the trustee's defenses with respect to the same transaction or occurrence.
no, but the theory of the tort claims act is that if the government is paying out of the treasury, it's going to see to it that its employees don't continue to commit the tort. so i don't think  i don't think you can make the argument that it would have had no effect on the improper behavior.
no, you have the  but that would be just like  like the solicitor general on the  the license plate case. someone who receives in the mail the license plate that says "live free or die" or "taxation without representation" and puts it on his car is not waiving a constitutional right by 
well, yes. you  you don't have to make up a hardship. you just say i want the money. okay, you want the money? here's the money.
well, it's all  the word right in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six words of the  of the sentence. well, whether the word right  i'm trying to fix it up. i'm trying to figure out 
 and a generic burglary statute?
you're  no, please.
 to do with 
 but the 
i don't understand that answer, in light of the previous discussion about the deliberate  deliberately.
so they  the ninth circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in this situation. both can sue and one gets  the damages are not identical. that's 
so what would his relief be? he can untake it.
in the case of a nonwillful infringer, a court in 
to the historical abuses that the founders were trying to address. and the 
well, if this money is the non-union member's money and an opt-out  i'm sorry  opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why should the first amendment permit anything other than an opt-in scheme.
you avoid it 
i know, but booker says what we're trying to do is to come close to what congress wanted but not violate the sixth amendment. now, what i think we're talking about now  i think  i mean, you sort of shed some  you clarified something very well for me, which is that in this case we're talking about the situation where the district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the attitude is going to be, well, the sentencing commission thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you have to  you better show me a good reason to think to the contrary. fine. but the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you're now talking about, is, well, what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if it's not an unusual case.
excuse me.
that's true, justice ginsburg. we would have three responses to that. one is first in ohio, as in the federal bureau of prisons, in the large majority of instances, most of the facts upon which a predictive assessment would turn have already been subject to some more formal type  trial-type procedure. for example, in the bureau of prisons, the vast majority of prisoners who are placed in one of our two more restrictive facilities have committed some violent act in prison for which they have been found to be guilty pursuant to formal wolff-type, trial-type procedures. secondly, with respect to facts that might be taken into consideration for which there hasn't yet been such a formal trial-type proceeding, this court has made clear that when you're talking about the types of predictive risk assessments that are at issue here, it is appropriate for prison officials, using their expertise and judgment and knowledge of the prison conditions in their prison and in the prison system as a whole, to take into account things that are rumor, innuendo, and other imponderables that may not have been proven in any fact-type proceeding.
well, we've already dealt with venue where i think your argument is exceedingly weak since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a requirement.
exactly. exactly, justice scalia. there's not only  there may be disputed evidence, but the standard may be different. it's not clear whether it was here, but at least as to some factors. it's clearly not enough that there's sufficient evidence to support the judge's determination. the question would be whether there's any  a jury could have found any doubt or when it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt, that the outcome would have been the same. but i do think in a case like this, it's important to keep in mind that it's  this case illustrates that these things are not categorically or necessarily unamenable to harmless error review. and in fact, what would happen in cases like this and a lot in the federal system, where you have undisputed, uncontested facts  and we know that because they had the incentive to contest them at a sentencing proceeding. and so to hold that automatic reversal is required would mean it would go back for a retrial that would have nothing to do  nothing to do with the element that was not decided by the jury. that would be undisputed. there's not going to be any contest back here that the firearm, the semi-automatic that was handed to the jury loaded and passed around to the jury, was a firearm. it would just be a second bite at the apple to contest things that were decided properly and beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, consistent with the defendant's constitutional rights.
but are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?
it would be no if this statutory regime governed, justice breyer.
well, why is 
i'm speaking practically. and i don't have to go into all the argument.
well, it 
maybe the prosecutors didn't want to come up with an all-white jury for fear it would be challenged.
that's true, but 
so there's nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case?
clearly the 
well, no, but i mean, that's  that's really wrong what the judge did. but  but the  that  that's tangential to the question. the question is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that the jury would have considered the evidence that he was converted? but since it did occur, you know, they  they didn't consider it. is it reasonably likely they never considered it? that's  that's the question. and then i can imagine, for what reason that justice ginsburg said, myself sitting in the california supreme court and saying, well, they heard the evidence for 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses. they're not technicians, the jury. and  and of course, they considered it. i can imagine that and that's why i'm having  even though i don't agree with it.
yes.
it seems to me that in this case, that  that all-purpose waiver that the judge, and not for the first time, proposed is  is what caused all this. and  and my question that i had is knowing that this was the judge's practice  and indeed, he had written about it  did the u.s. attorney's office try to do something to say, look, the act doesn't permit that kind of thing?
of course, you can or you wouldn't have the  the combination of the two terms appearing anywhere. so why isn't the problem here not whether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?
 isn't that right? yes.
ms. millett.
but if that's the boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one happen later matter?
and that's worrying me too.
 assert that we shouldn't interpret this statute to have done it.
no, your honor. their complaint rests on two factors that are clearly within slusa. first, misrepresentations. they claim that our prospectuses misled them into investing in these mutual funds and then 
why doesn't your position on the underlying merits of the timeliness question create an incentive for every habeas petitioner to file a cert petition?
mr. taranto, before you go back to that, i wanted to be clear on what you were saying would be left over for trial.
was there with the patton and the goo?
well, 921(20) or 
well 
if you  if you disagreed with the resolution of an issue by the state court, which issue would be determinative of your federal claim, if we hold against you here? do you think you would have a right to appeal that state court  state supreme court resolution of that issue to this court?
 or sale.
and when they do it, your honor, the answer of the students is, "we don't believe you. we read your message as being that there are two tiers. there's a" 
no, but what i would say about 
when was this  the underlying statute at issue here enacted?
that's the issue. was there an immediate risk of death or serious bodily harm 
yes, your honor, because the  the cases did clearly hold that the matter of  as an indian tribe was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. and as a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, it is completely established law that that may not be waived. it may be raised at any time. so 
well 
well, the important distinction is that the two grounds that  on which we are defending the statute here were not addressed in united foods. in particular, the government speech argument, that what i've just said goes to, that the court specifically did not address because it had not 
no, your honor.
it is rather odd, your honor, but my read of this court's rules are that there is no mechanism for a respondent, the party that won below, to, in effect, give up its victory once they get in this court. i'm not quite sure why they wish to drop the breach of contract claims. perhaps they feel that by dropping the breach of contract claim, they somehow obtain a tactical advantage. and, if that's the case, certainly this court should not allow them to rewrite the question presented in order to obtain a tactical advantage. but, in any event, both the breach of contract claim and the preferential transfer claims are attempts to augment the estate and are barred by sovereign immunity.
you're not saying  you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.
and why 
why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?
 you only get the extra 90 days if you actually file, under your explanation for why this cert petition is  why this habeas petition is untimely. in other words, if this individual had filed a cert petition with us, his petition  his habeas petition would be timely. and he's only going to get the extra period, as i understand your position on the timeliness, if he files a cert petition.
thank you, mr. smith.
but justice breyer 
well, sure, if they have a contract, as part of their  part of their contract, they get the bottled water, that's  that's easy to see why that's covered. but the  the question is when it's not. it's just something that the employer does in the course of his business that has  that benefits both his business and his workers.
there were relevant changes in law in some circuits, your honor. there was  i don't believe any dispositive change in tenth circuit law 
okay.
well, but  but the additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make it  to make it look good.
no, we're not. michigan and the states want to be able to help their citizens with abusive and predatory lending complaints.
well, i'm  i'm not going away with a clear idea of your position.
but it is within the contours of the constitution if, in a "non-weighing" state, the same evidence could be considered.
but the grand jury did find probable cause. so what would the plaintiff have to show to overcome  to  to negate that finding of probable cause?
what if the 
yes, your honor.
i'd say  that's  there's a question 
okay.
we find all the time that a right is not clearly established under aedpa, and so forth  and disregard what i just said. that's my first question. and the second is willfully, as screws itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.
well, your honor, i think that the principle  well-accepted principle that the more specific provision will govern over the general governs here. so the remedy provision, the sanctions provision here says that the indictment shall be dismissed whether it's 71 days that elapsed or 200 days or 5 years.
because he will not have exhausted until he files and has 
content neutrality goes to what speech is suppressed or punished. as far as the school delivering its own message, there is no requirement of equal time or that it be neutral. it's got its own viewpoint in the case of drugs, a viewpoint that almost all of us agree with, and it should be able to espouse 
yes.
yes.
the district court held the guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.
 the trilogy.
the scow. the 
and  and if in fact 
but it sounds to me as if the things you're saying now are matters for proof, and i  i think the wiggle room in the government's position was it said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or other. well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn those over to the experts for the proof, you end up with your theory. the  the inflation comes out and it comes out because they didn't get the earnings that they would have had or there may be many reasons.
yes, your honor. the trulson study, however, only looked at inmates after they had left the reception center, only looked at inmates in  in the integrated settings of the prison, equivalent to the areas that california integrates. so we don't dispute that once you have enough individualized information about an inmate, then you can house them according to an individualized information.
the federal trade commission 
that's  that's all that was argued. and it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an  a changing amount as years went by, that clearly we would have  the interest would have run on the existing liability. but it's an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by.
to be sure. but the 
indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?
no, but on my hypothesis he's going to get the same jury.
thank you.
suppose 
well, your honor, i think everyone, including the lower courts in this case, agrees that you don't look at the goods generically. you have to look at their characteristics to determine like grade and quality. and i would actually think that the grade 
then how could the seventh circuit have gotten it that wrong?
and you're talking about denial of a right that didn't exist. that seems perfectly rational, the way you put it.
no, i didn't say that.
no, well, the reason it would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out of. and it puts the burden of the prisoner to go through and figure out what he really wants to say. that's why  that's why it's easier for the judge just to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out if there is anything here that was exhausted.
but, your honor, the principle that having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one that is at the heart, not just at the 
i believe simply that the word per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per each agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time a student generates 
perhaps?
i'm sorry, on that, i didn't think that the reg was defining the word "dispense." i thought the statute defines the word "dispense." and it's  persons registered by the ag to dispense controlled substances are exempt. and then you look at who is such a person. a person who does that is a practitioner. and who is a practitioner? a registered practitioner is one who prescribes, a physician registered by the united states to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in the course of professional practice. and i thought this reg is defining "in the course of professional practice." am i wrong about that? i thought it was a reg that says, "in the course of professional practice, the prescription, to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner." now, i might be wrong. how does it work?
 in any suit you can join the united states as a necessary party.
i believe there were six.
yes. in this  yes. in 
but again, it would work only if the 1-year period began to run from this court's retroactivity decision. if it begins to run from initial recognition, then that would turn paragraph 6(3) into an absolute nullity because i know of no case where this court has made a retroactivity decision within a year of when it initially recognizes a right.
but isn't that 
did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times? (laughter.)
that's right.
 even as a class action?
well, let me put it this way. if we were to find that the geneva convention or other settled principles of international law were controlling here, why couldn't we just remand to the d.c. circuit and let it figure that out? or let it  have the tribunal figure it out, in the first instance, assuming the tribunal is properly authorized.
no, you're not wrong, justice breyer. and i would say that the 
well before the delivery of the package in such a circumstance, your honor. they bring a duplicate  a duplicate warrant to the magistrate who  and they  and there's an agent who stays with the magistrate. they then control  are in complete control at this point of the contraband.
well. oh, yes.
i guess there  there are couple things there. one is that we are not  we  we are not here relying on the waiver for all time. our point, instead, here is that when defendant requested the continuance at issue here, it was the defendant that said, your honor, i  i need a continuance and i waive my rights so you should give me the continuance and then also said he needed additional preparation time. the court then  and this  this is at j.a. from about page 81 to 85. the court then said, well, why do you need the time? and the court discussed with him for a while why he really needed additional preparation time, reminded counsel that, notwithstanding the waiver, this was a criminal case and criminal cases do need to be tried, and ended up balancing the defendant's desire for preparation against the need for a speedy trial by granting a much shorter continuance than requested. and that is actually an entirely appropriate ends of justice balancing, ends of justice reasoning.
thank you, counsel. mr. wolf.
that  that may be, but it is a different claim.
thank you, counsel. mr. tribe.
i  i think two things, your honor. first, i'd like to say that i think an enormous difference between the european illustrations, for example, that you give in this setting is that here the federal arbitration act is not a common law rule of let's push as many cases as we can from the civil justice system into arbitration. it is a statute that has language. and the way this court has treated that language before is this court has always said not until the case falls within section 2 will you then go and enforce section 2, that you have to be in the act before you apply the act.
well, there might be. there's a set of valueless patents.
"a reasonable possibility of an investigation."
conflict preemption basically strikes down a state law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the federal law.
 on that. but 
the child is. the child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free. that's really the only interest they have on the table, it seems to me, separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child.
 and that's why i think it's important to preserve a role for the sony test. and, again, this court, in sony, could have adopted a simple theoretical-capability test, but this court, instead, adopted a test that required there to be shown some commercially significant use for the  noninfringing use. and even in the patent context, where i think the test is, and should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases like fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show that there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested theoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use of the item.
but  and  you  therefore, it should be just like everyone else with respect to this negligent delivery in 
if it were the case  and there's no evidence on the record to suggest this  that a substantial number of cases were going to start coming through california with massive delays, and this court was going to be forced to provide statutory tolling, that would be a problem. but there's no evidence to suggest that. and that ties back to 
right.
may i just. was there a petition for a rehearing en banc in this case?
well, but that  but that doesn't follow. i mean, it is not a principle of law that so long as the object is  is lawful and within the power of the united states, all means to which even that object are lawful. that is simply not true. there are various means of stopping that pollution, and it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes too deeply into the state's power to regulate land within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one. that  that's not an extraordinary proposition.
now we have a number of states that do put the burden on the school district. is there any indication that the cost is higher in those states than in states that put the burden on the parents?
mr. pincus, how do you determine the price of the logs? because we, the charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to determine cost, that's one thing. but we are, also in this picture is that some of the logs came from weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term contracts that it had, and those, the price was not inflated on those. so if you take those into account you may get one figure, but if you take only the high bid logs you might get a different picture. so how, what is it? how do you determine costs? do you look at all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that were allegedly bid out?
no. if you look  that is correct. if you look at the circuit court opinion, it  and even the district court opinion and the findings made, there is no finding that any water has ever left the petitioners' wetland into the ditch.
 to counter 
well, do you take that  please.
why wouldn't it?
you read 3 and 3 says what you said it says. all right. how much later did they promulgate 109?
no, your honor. we have not raised the privacy act as an issue before this court.
absolutely, your honor. there  - the statute of limitations in aedpa is designed to prevent delay, not to  as congress has said, it's not a forfeiture provision; it's designed to move these complaints along speedily, particularly in capital cases, of which this is not one.
no, i'm not denying that. i just didn't think that had anything to do with this case. i mean, i thought that the object of the indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that. you are saying, and then there is another requirement, which seems a little vague. it's been hard for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule you have to have facts. official i don't know if those are the same. i thought they were two separate things.
so why shouldn't it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review? direct review, everyone agrees that you get the state final judgment. but then you have 90 days and nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is granted, until the cert process is done. why shouldn't it be just the same for collateral review?
but you're talking about 
 congress 
such revenues or expenditures in the state consist of, the word "such" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the state, and that prior reference in subsection a is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.
you are 
i think sometimes it could be something else.
i think that scenario is closer to neder than it is to this case.
 with the notion that the loss occurred at the time your purchased?
i suppose that happens pretty often in removal  in  in removed cases. you really don't know what the defense is going to be. if it's removed on the basis of the well-pleaded complaint, when the defense gets there, it  it may often be a state  a state defense. right?
 below, in the d.c. circuit. in addition, we believe that this statute doesn't fall within the bruner hallowell presumption that the government seeks to  seeks to use here, for a few reasons. the first is, this is not a statute that is merely divesting a lower court of jurisdiction. rather, it's a statute that alters substantive rights of mr. hamdan. in particular, as the government itself says, it eliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted, which is compliance with the geneva conventions. in addition, it alters entirely what both courts below found, which is that mr. hamdan has a pretrial right, a right analogous to abney versus united states, to bring his claim now, because he's challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal. that pretrial right is something that mirrors  that goes all the way back to the founding, in the early cases that this court decided, on pretrial habeas. in addition, we believe that 
mr. jett, do i take it, from what you've just said, that you are recognizing this is a question of federal common law and not due process, so that if congress placed the burden on the defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity? you're just arguing that this is the federal common law?
yes.
but that goes back to frothingham and mellon, and massachusetts versus mellon, and united states versus butler, where we could trace the amount.
issue preclusion or claim preclusion?
i think that 
this, the one that's cited in the regulation itself. because i  otherwise, i don't, i ignore those things. that's cited in the regulation. does that report say it?
he said there's ample evidence from which the court could conclude 
and that evidence was admitted in.
well, on the waiver point, let's assume that this case had not come in  come here, and you had gone back to the district court pursuant to the order of the ninth circuit. surely you would have taken the position, or you could have taken the position if the evidence developed that way, that he really knew or should have known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived. you certainly could continue to take that position in the district court.
that's why i was talking about yellowstone.
 u.s. v. harvey steel is 
he could have refused  he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not.
the important point, though, your honor, is that the occ has no independent power to preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign state.
you're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the  so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the united states. that's a very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the united states" means. what i'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the united states, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under  under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the government's recovery.
well 
well, to  see if i understand your question correctly. if you're looking with someone with that nervous tic, that would be something in open view or plain view. that's not the type of investigation i'm talking about. there is in fact, most respectfully, an investigation technique here. there's an investigation measure.
to me, just reading the text of the statute is a little ambiguous. i'm not entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading that statute, i got the impression that congress thought that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment when there was enough evidence out there that people were concerned about it and so forth, that there would be a duty there, but you think not?
 to deterrence 
 don't remember.
i mean 
do you have a second choice rule? i mean, we have professor amar, who has pretty formal criteria.
mr. gornstein, just out of curiosity, of the 29 states that have the different rule, in how many of those states was the different rule adopted legislatively and in how many states was it pronounced by the state supreme court?
there are very clear standards, your honor 
but justice stevens's question highlights the point that you criticize about: the randomness of it is often a critical element. i suppose it makes much more sense to say you're subject to a random drug test than that you have to come in at a scheduled time, when you  presumably, you could refrain from using drugs prior to the test. and, to some extent, it's the same, even if you're not talking about a drug test.
do you have any 
no. i never met anyone who did, but i guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody might think that, i guess. and i guess that if people  there is some tendency of the people that are worried, you know, there are pro ses, there are all kinds of people, somebody could claim that. so you want a way to keep them out.
i'm  i'm sorry. you've lost me. i don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to third parties. what 
and don't you think that a civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to limit that kind of cross-examination?
if you analogize the stj to the administrative alj. but you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.
yes, that's what  i mean, that  that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, i guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself.
well, i would suggest that, in part, the language of the cripa, which is  i believe, is  that's how i pronounce it; i believe that's what your honor is referring to  in part, precluded the possibility of a default  procedural default bar largely because it required a continuance of a case for 90  or i believe it started out as 180 days, and then became 90 days. and  in order to permit the judge to order the inmate to go back and exhaust  and under those circumstances, even if he had been untimely by virtue of the continuance language, he was, nonetheless, permitted to return to federal court. so, i think by virtue of the language of the statute, it's at least possible that congress had a  deliberately excluded that possibility. moreover, i think that the statutory history and the statutory purposes in this case support the conclusion that congress intended inmates to require with applicable grievance proceedings. and if i may refer to the statutory history, in this court  excuse me, in booth v. churner, this court recognized that this court's prior decision in mccarthy v. madigan constituted a substantial portion of the statutory history from the plra's exhaustion requirement. and, in relevant part, for purposes of the question presented here, that decision observed that  or assumed that an exhaustion  a mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners would necessitate the compliance of administrative filing deadlines.
all you'd have to do is have a little thing  and it would just say, "usda requires this, under the program," and then the whole problem goes away.
well, that  the legislative history of the amendment in 1990 does not discuss the aspect of barrett that went to the comparison to decide what  in what circumstances there would be an analogous federal crime. it was clear that it wanted to ratify the result that state crimes are covered. but we think that that was evident from the 1988 amendments to  that both enacted the definition of "aggravated felony," revised the definition of "drug-trafficking crime" to delete the requirement that it be a federal felony  that was deleted in 1988  and enhanced sentences 
justice ginsburg, in the case of 7426, congress never made that remedy expressly exclusive. the language is completely missing from that statute. and the argument was raised in united states vs. williams that if section 1346 was made available to third parties, like mrs. williams, it would render meaningless the short statute of limitations. 1346 offers only post deprivation relief. section 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation relief. so the two statutes can live in harmony and can be harmonized and should not be held to have preempt  one over the other when there is no express declaration from congress making that the case.
do you agree that there would be federal court review in this court from a state court determination on the applicability of slusa in this case?

yes, your honor, he did.
no, but that's 
of course, that factor 
no, justice souter, i don't think you could because i think to do that would federalize a great many state law causes of action that just happen to have, as an element of them, a violation of some federal law that, due to the supremacy clause, the states would, of course, be obliged to enforce.
did the case use the phrase "capable of repetition and evading review," or  which is a mootness

what you have instead is a law of the united states that's enacted to serve perfectly valid interests that the united states government has in rooting out fraud in this country and in dealing with schemes to defraud that are created here. and for the court to say that, "we don't like these kinds of prosecutions, because we're concerned about really bad foreign tax systems, and we're concerned about complicated law, and we're concerned that some common law rule that had never actually assumed the scope that petitioners ascribed to it, should be formed  read as the background principle for the interpretation of this statute" is not a principle that finds any support in the construction of federal 
they should respond by making an objective probable cause determination 
well  in criminal.
well, if congress had decided the comptroller general is right, and had done that in subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the way justice scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't apply to administrative claims at all. what it did is, it said, "ooh, this appears to apply to administrative claims and the comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are important, so we will give a special statute of limitations period in 31 u.s.c. for those, and exempt them from the more general statute of limitations period in section 28 u.s.c. 2415." so, i don't believe that it should be read that way. is it frivolous to suggest that that's the reading? no, the government 
what would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review?
sure.
well, you say  you say an  an estate plan. most people would think insurance policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is that within the texas probate court jurisdiction?
well, i tend to agree with you on that point as well 
and you're arguing that in this case you have the first.
well, a decision from a federal court  and i guess  i think the answer to your  your honor's question is yes, it does. and the reason i say that is i think we need to look to the consequences of the federal court decision that would follow from the claims that  that the plaintiffs  or i'm sorry  the prisoners here are advancing. the state of ohio has made individualized decisions with respect to each of these respondents that they should not again be considered for release from prison until 2005. the request  the relief that they're requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if successful, would result in the federal court undermining that state decision with regard to the length that they should be incarcerated. it goes directly to the  the 
and this one rolled her eyes.
and then the claim would be this: you want a hearing in which you're going to present the sister, the landrigans, what they did , what the school says, what happened to him at school, all things that are there in affidavit 5 which was in the state court, and that the biological gene. and you want to say, am i right, i don't want to put words in your mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this been looked into and presented to the defendant, the defendant would not have said don't present any of that, it would have been presented, and it would have made a difference. what  is that what you want to do?
i thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the equal pay act.
but  but if the recovery is set up in such a way that it never goes into the personal account of the accident victims and, instead, just what happened in great-west, isn't that what every personal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this case?
but the hood  the hood decision with respect to penry ii is being forgiving to criminal defendant. it's not a bar. it's forgiving a bar. that does not mean that the almanza standard which had been present for  has been present in state law for over 20 years is suddenly inadequate.
but  but 
can i just ask you to tell us what your strongest case is? because they did raise that question.
congress  congress used words, "strong inference." those words are not self-defining. one can think of several ways, in fact the courts of appeals did think of several ways. why should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one might define them?
that's true to this  just as is true with defenses based on statute of limitations or res judicata or, you know, a whole host of defenses 
if that 
but that's what i don't understand. we're now talking about that part of taylor which deals with a narrow statute where our object is not to find out what he's guilty of or anything. we're just trying to find out what was the crime he was charged with. and there are two or three states which lump together in one statute crimes that are violent and nonviolent. burglary of a structure is violent. burglary of a car or a ship is not. so all we want to know is what was the charge at issue. now, do you  let me break the question into two parts. the key sentence here, i think, is for example, in a state whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile, as well as a building, if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with burglary of a building, then it's going to be violent. now, would you  would you agree with me or not that he could have written  justice blackmun  that same sentence to say if, for example, the indictment or information and jury instructions show? would you be willing to add those two words, for example?
not with respect to adjustment of status.
but our  the answer is no. because what we are also urging the court to consider is its gloss on tinker and frazier, and also what this court said in kuhlmeier. and in frazier, the court was very clear, the first three paragraphs in part three of the opinion, in talking about the habits and manners of civility, and inculcating the values of citizenship. that, in fact, is what is happening here. there is an effort of the  to prevent a message that is inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools, which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten, and we believe that is permitted under tinker 
doesn't that suggest to you that the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like that?
 let me put it this way. if they're gonna  if they're going to say it, though, they have to say it with very clear language, because, otherwise, there would be no fair warning. you couldn't conclude from the language of the witness-tampering statute, which is designed to protect witnesses, that congress had made all record-retention programs unlawful. i also think, your honor, that when it comes time to construe section 1519, some kind of nexus will have to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because, otherwise, you are correct, all document retention policies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.
 just on the point of the causal relation that the chief justice was exploring, i mean, there is a causal relation in a but-for sense. we know that.
they have not been discharged.
why would it be a mess? i mean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is filed  something is filed within the two year statute, the district court can tell virtually immediately whether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to be held, and the district court can simply, it can simply stay further proceedings until those criminal proceedings are over. if there's a possibility of collateral attacks, the district court can simply say hey, are you going to file a collateral attack? and if the answer is yes, stay it further. if the answer is no, go ahead with it then. what's tough about that?
and if the state allowed it, the federal government would have to allow the drugs to be used for that purpose

that's what you want me to focus on.
it's the only  it's tons per year consistently. the other thing i would point out, as the court is aware, is that 307(b) applies it bars courts in enforcement actions, which includes this court. this case is not up on cert from the d.c. circuit in new york. thank you very much.
it's sudden provocation, yes, sir.
but you did that on collateral review as opposed to trying to supplement the direct appeal?
that's one of the passages that i am referring to, and it came as a direct response to the district attorney, in effect, calling out the defense attorney, "i can't imagine that you won't be told that this fits within factor (k)." so, at that point, the defense counsel had to make a decision, "okay, either i have to argue that my skipper evidence is  my square peg of skipper evidence has to fit in the round hole of" 
but what  what interest does the government have in holding somebody when the conduct for which he was convicted is no longer a crime?

mr. van amberg, could a state get to the same result? let's say your reading of the statute is the only permissible one. by combining school districts, it's no longer going to be the x school district and the y school district, it will be the xy school district, and then the population would increase. still only one lea.

thank you, mr. gold. mr. laurence.
so, if, in fact, you were to lose 18 on (a), i guess the whole section would fall, because it 19 wouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the 20 whole thing, (a), (b), and (c).
 this is the only way someone could 
i mean 
that's what it says. it's a  it's a phrase, just as it's in the california statute, that directs the jury, as a sentencing factor, to consider the facts and circumstances of the crime along with any special circumstances found to be true. and this court's made it clear, in stringer and in other cases, that how the state court sees its statutory language ought to be dispositive. and california has repeatedly held  and we submit it's not reasonably likely a jury would interpret it any other way  that that means that the jury is to consider the facts and circumstances of the case, all of those facts and circumstances, including those that underlie the special circumstances. that 
well, your honor, it doesn't say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with that is that when he filed this petition, he was not being confined 
well, what about the argument that the statute, in effect, limits the  our  our interpretation limits the  the detention to a period reasonably related to the government's interest in accomplishing that interest? that interest is different in  in the case of  of aliens who are excluded, if we accept that class as distinct from all excludables. and  and that may allow a much longer period of detention, among other things, to deter dictators from  from dumping. you've given us an answer to what to do if they dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place. that argument stops short of saying we can detain them for life, but it would support the  the position that on a consistent interpretation of the statute, the government could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in others. what's your answer to that?
so it doesn't require a final state application. it requires a final judgment about the state application.

i think that is permissible because 
but it was a specific  there was a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money to those grantees. and the argument was those grantees weren't entitled to any of that money because the way they were using it violated the establishment clause. and so there was  the government's own action by designating a specific sum of money in that grant identified a specific sum of money, and the challenge was to that entire expenditure as identified by the government.
they could, and many of them did.
no, but i'm trying to see what rico adds to the normal conspiracy law

would that be true if i simply wanted to get into the  if my intent was to get on the other side of the fence but not into the dwelling? for example, you know, i wanted to steal the apples on the tree?

i find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation. official is there anybody doing something differently because they believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of proximate causality? does anybody act differently because of that rule? i don't think so.
for the year. that's correct, your honor.
mr. bopp, right  right there i guess i  i have a problem with  with your argument, and i just want to get it out. i went back and looked at some of the examples that were given at  in  in the mcconnell case for parallels between what we  what we thought was covered in those cases and  and yours  your case. and the  the one which i  i guessed was probably the closest was the  was the advertisements there in  in the mcconnell case on the  the lobbying on the chinese trade relations. the basic message in  in that case was china uses forced labor. the congress of the united states is about to make it easier for  for chinese goods to get in here and for china to have a respectable trade status. and  and it said, call congressman myrick, i think it was, in any case, a member of congress, and  and say what you think. in this case, you're  you're talking about a  a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're filibustering nominees and they're not coming up to  to a vote. tell the two senators in this state, kohl and feingold, that  that you don't like this. the only difference that i could see basically between the two kinds of ads was that in the first one  in  in the myrick ad, they actually gave the number of the  of the congressional office to call and say, hey, don't do this. in this case, your clients did not give a  a number. they gave a web site to an organization. insofar as i know, it doesn't have a number. which gets me to the question. if the  the chinese trade relations ad was presumably validly subject to the act, i don't see why your client's ad is not, for the same reason, subject to the act and for the further reason that it doesn't even give a phone number to call  to  to lobby the people. so it seems to me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going to go back and simply reexamine mcconnell to  to  from  from scratch, that your clients fall within the general rule as  as we held it in mcconnell. so why doesn't precedent foreclose this?
can you  can you 
because the court still accepts it, reviews it to see if any of the exceptions apply.
well, i would have a different position on that. first of all, i think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a  a jury verdict and  and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.
counsel, where  where in the record is the testimony of the fbi agents that you were referring to?
 of relief that existed 
justice scalia, i don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence. there have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts. i think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable, mr. district judge, and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day lower. another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion and apply the section 3553 factors. we are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here. all we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the federal system, if you don't have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, it's not more, then i don't think courts of appeals have a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their tasks. and if the courts of appeals can do that, can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, without violating the statute and without violating the constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the court to ask at that point is which approach, that approach of proportionality, or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only, absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms to congress's intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency.
absolutely.
well, what is your authority for the proposition that we use strict scrutiny?
there's two differences between that. in any of those "weighing" states  well, in mississippi and florida, for example  the eligibility or aggravating factors are  are the sole aggravation at sentencing, and 
 the warrant  the warrant itself didn't depend on anything they had gained as a result of the entry. there was no 
is it or not, in your view?
right. obviously 
that's right. i'm sorry. it brings official us back to the question that you asked: whether the ninth circuit, or the fcc for that matter, can shoehorn this into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice.
it's 
what are the penalties for those charges?
and according to the district court, in this very case, the state attorney general conceded that new york's measure allowing direct sales by in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.
say it's a 
i, i think that would be a judgment call. i think the, i think the casual use 
even if it's true  even if it's true 
what i mean by saying it wasn't litigated is that it was the understanding of the parties at trial that the firearm element was not at issue because that had not been charged, that that was not the charge in front of the jury.
i 
in other words, miccosukee was concerned not with molecules, but with chemical composition. the chemical composition was the same in this body and in that body, and, in that sense, there was no addition 
no.
thank you, mr. dreeben.
they are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.
what did she hear?
all right.
same puzzlement.
correct. it's  the only argument they've ever made 
okay.
what should a judge do if he thought some weight should be given to military service?
your honor, the constitution  specifically, the eleventh amendment  confirms that the states are not to be treated like private parties. private parties are not immune from contract actions; states are. private parties are not immune from torts  from tort actions.
that is correct. that  that is correct, your honor. now, i mean  and let me make two points about that. the first is that as a  as a general matter, the tax code defines gross income expansively, and there's a number of this court's cases that make that clear. then  then the question becomes are there deductions provided that allow for certain expenses to be deducted.
exactly.
 its bacigalupo 
in  in discussing the  the answer to the  the kyllo issue, you've  you place an emphasis on the protection given to a house. would you go back to justice o'connor's question and my earlier example? is it still your answer that the police can walk dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to the front door and ring the bell and see what it  what it sniffs when the door is opened 
you may  you may be right, but that's what district courts are there for.
that's because the judge, as opposed the jury 
well, what's  what's the 
by that you're talking linguistically, but i am interested in the purpose. so i looked up on the internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent. so 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score. now i take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people. and if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices. and that's why i asked my question about the boy who calls wolf. what will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices? i suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease. now, do you have any light you can shed on that?
but two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?
borrow 
we  we think subsection (b) is unambiguous in preempting any statement.
is that true? what do you think?
do you agree? because i think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing power to the prosecutor, who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged. so i agree that that might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only because the prosecutor would have total power to decide what the sentence will be.
well, then why didn't you make the argument? i mean, if hood said, when you make a partial  or one institution  if i understand what you're saying, hood said that a waiver by one institution waives for the whole state. is that  is that what hood said?
yes. but even if that's regarded as authoritative, this court has so often said legislative history cannot justify ignoring plain meaning. and, given the comma and the word "or" and the fact that, otherwise, the words "by physical violence" would have no meaning 
because the courts held that the requisites of slusa of subsection (b) had not been satisfied.
as this court defined market power 
 against retroactive 
i suppose 
why did they keep the other 80 percent?
you don't have a case.
yes. within  i think, in effect, if you were to decide  if you decided that the convention itself had intended 
but the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the equal protection clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin. so saying that this doesn't involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and not any other factor.
 american 
the same time that 552.3 was finally promulgated.
well, we're not  we're not trying the court for a bad intent. we're looking at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of what it's done is to leave in place something that's slanted based on  on statewide registration in favor of the democrats, then  then, it seems to me, there's  there's a ground for the new legislature to act. and  and one  one reason legislatures may not have redrawn plans often is because they always protect incumbents.
should 
i mean, i think it's worse if  if you're subjected to it without having committed any violation at all. every time i travel abroad and come back into the country, customs officers have dogs and  and they parade the dogs through  through the baggage terminal. do  do i feel offended by that?
can i respond to that specifically?
mr. barnett, i thought 
no, your honor, it would not. and the record in this case actually does not support that that  does not support a proposition that black jurors were questioned differently. most significantly, the minimum  the questioning on the graphic script. of the six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the graphic  graphic script at the outset of their voir dire, carrol boggess and  and wayman kennedy, both of whom had answered the questions in their juror questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views on the death penalty regarding their support for the death penalty. this fact 
well, let's be honest about it. let's be totally accurate. it's not going to say, "the government believes this." the government may not believe it. what it says is, "this message is brought to you by the beef association under the  under a program requiring contributions to advertising of the department of agriculture."
well, i  i can't say that because you get to ask the questions.
but if justice 
i still think it's whether because i don't agree with the government. can i do that?
now, what would that harm be?
well, the  the california supreme court decision makes clear at page 113a of the petition appendix that it decided the takings claims, the substantially advance claims, on a demurrer and that they decided it, therefore, based on the factual allegations of the complaint, matters subject to judicial notice, of which there were many, and facts and circumstances that were not disputed. i mean, it  there's no such thing, i don't believe, as the resolution of a legal claim in which no issues are decided. there were plenty of issues decided in this case.
 because the court 
well, but is that a  is that on a legislative history record somewhere? do we know that?
not at all, mr. chief justice. i didn't mean to be light about that.
 because there is 
so the only question is where.
no. no. but  no, but  yes. no, it's 
and what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the ninth circuit?
but, but the focus here is on the reasonableness of the state court's factual finding.
well, i'd say that's a shame for the democratic process. i  i don't like the idea that  that there are a lot of districts out there that have never been drawn by the people, which is what the constitution envisions.
 not to when you reentered. and what we're  what you're arguing for here is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not from the time of deportation. so, it's not really a parallel.
oh.
 a discriminatory matter. it was your burden to show that whatever discrimination existed  assuming that we find the law the way bacchus seemed to say it is  it was your burden to show that there was some justification for that discrimination.
well, no, no. may i pick you up on that? because there's a point at which you and i are disagreeing about rogers. and in all candor, i think it's because you are ignoring one part of rogers, and if i'm wrong, i want you to tell me. you quote the slightest bit language from rogers on both page 26 and 33 of your brief. and you take that as being language that eliminates the proximate cause requirement. what you don't include in your quotation is the footnote in justice brennan's opinion following that slightest cause language. and the footnote was to a citation, the citation was to the coray case. the opinion in coray was written by justice douglas and  i'm sorry, justice black. and in the very language that justice black used, he said expressly that if proximate official cause is shown, there can be recovery. now, given the fact that in rogers, the very citation to the language which you say eliminated the proximate cause requirement cited a case in which proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on, i don't see how you can read rogers  maybe later cases, but i don't see how you can read rogers as eliminating the proximate cause requirement. and therefore, i think you have to read rogers as addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate causation. now, am i going wrong there somewhere?
because 
 without any clue whether there's a relevance test? i mean, here we're talking about alibi evidence. if the determination of guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty stage. that's why i found that statute so puzzling, that the jury doesn't have a clue. they're told, "everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can consider," but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell them, relevance.
the case is submitted.
what  what page?
not 
may i ask this  two questions about california? is the problem we're discussing, with these long delays, primarily in the application the third range, the application of the california supreme court, as opposed to lower courts?
yes, but what percentage did they have? i  i thought that  you say that they should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts did the plan give them?
that's correct.
he does, your honor, and what he says is 
where do you disagree?
the trial, your honor, was approximately 20 years ago. the jurors who convicted mr. house heard that bloodstains on mr. house's blue jeans matched the blood belonging to the victim. they didn't hear the assistant chief medical examiner for the state of tennessee testify that the source of those bloodstains was a sample taken during ms. muncey's autopsy, nor did they hear 
you  you can't limit it to inherent government functions. both the inherent and the noninherent government functions would fall within this provision 
 to answer my hypothetical please. if in fact  you didn't want me to repeat it?
i know, but 14  is it 1415(f)? specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing. i'm looking at 1415(f)(1)(a). in other words, parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.
not at all. that is very true.
you put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me. read through the language. as you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as bfoq is the defense to disparate treatment. and that all seems to work. but you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even justice o'connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. it's hard for an employer to make that defense. and while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well. you start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases. so i can't believe that congress really would have wanted that, but the reason i can't believe it is because i can't believe the business necessity part of it. and so here i'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now i don't know what to do.
may i ask 
when you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that? why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?
the evidence that's in the record was the procedure in place prior to the enactment of new policy 111-07, and the court choose  chose to review for procedural purposes policy 111-07 and then make its decision based on new policy 111-07. so the evidence that's in the record, the testimony at the  during the trial, really is not relevant to this policy. it's relevant to the former policy. if  if 
yeah.
 a school, as a matter of its own policy says, "we don't like discrimination, and we're not going to give discriminators access to any of our facilities, period."
well, there has been no summary judgment 
well, but that's important for this whole question. quantity relates to chain of custody.
why is that reading anything in? i mean, do  do you think if  if you were not practically capable, you would be capable?
it's schedule 2 drug.
i do believe that it makes a difference that there is no alternative remedy. however, in this case, i don't think 
see, i don't think that's true, though, because there's a distinction i'd like to draw between having a remedy under 502(a)(3) of erisa and having a remedy at all. we would suggest that the plan can intervene in the state court suit. we would suggest that the plan could write a letter to the tortfeasor notifying the tortfeasor that it has a subrogation right, and if the tortfeasor entered into a release, it wouldn't be viable. so there may be good reason for the federal court to enter the injunction that you suggested, mr. chief justice, merely to prevent the dissipation of the funds because the funds might need to be preserved for a separate purpose.
oh, i'm sure 
that's correct, your honor. had 
i doubt if you'd take that position if they did it. (laughter.)
but you say that's different from the government bringing the action.
have we talked about that?
when? i mean, when is the predicted cataclysm?
that would be permissible?
i'm  i'm assuming parked cars. you haven't interrupted anybody. nobody is in the car, parked on a public street.
 none of that were true  if none of that were true, he could still file his complaint. presumably it survives a motion to dismiss, and it goes at least to summary judgment. and that's true in every case of a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior.
i was going to say, what was  what were the grounds upon which the warrant, in segura, was obtained?
 by  by the way that it is  allegedly provides phony social security cards.
fine.
there  there was much, much more evidence.
because clearly the  the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as  as justice scalia just stated, that allows the  the debtors to  to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that  that it would be for retirement purposes.
in this case.
well, i  i think that's the grammatically correct way to read it. but even  even if it was just modifying the adversely affect 
it would if the  if the prescription violated the state law, the u.s. attorney general could take action against the physician.
they are making the claim of privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110 claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your clients were spies. do you respond by saying, yes, we were spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?
there was a question implying, "you'd better speak to us," and there was an answer to that question. not an initiation.
are you, ms. blatt, taking the position that that is a tighter test than would apply ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?
that was a slip on the district court's part, wasn't it? i mean, that original petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert petition to this court should not have been dismissed, it should have been held, in which case the petition would have been timely and would not have been trumped by an aedpa variant.
we certainly think it would. i take it respondents in this case would disagree and would point to the language of 552.3. i'm not sure, for example, how the second circuit would have resolved that question, given the way it viewed the statute here. but we do think that that would apply and so i think one view of that would be it's largely prospective.
then  then you have to accept the fact that  that congress cannot effectively regulate the navigable  the  the condition of the navigable water itself because if all the  the  let's  let's assume there's a class of  of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck the  the navigable waters of the united states. all they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can dump anything they want to. it will eventually get into the navigable water, and congress can't do anything about it on your theory.
but your honor, i don't think that putting a teen's health at risk, respectfully, is  i don't think saving a statute is worth putting a teen's health at risk.
but, but, but  well, let's assume that there is a claim that includes something that should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the universe. can a patent still be definite if it includes that sort of unpatentable claim?
for a different basket of services, your honor. a basket of services that includes a wider range of, of goals that the private sector has no interest in providing. to return, to return to the question of whether or not this is an inappropriate benefit for the citizens, i would argue that there is a meaningful distinction between government taking an action which benefits the citizens as a whole, which we would hope any government law would  any law passed by a government would do, as opposed to a law that benefits a local private economic interest and is intended to do so. for the dormant commerce clause to reach that far would be unprecedented. it would implicate not only electricity but under petitioner's theory it would implicate, i would think for example government decisions to provide prison and correctional services through a public system as opposed to a private one. what about school bus services? car insurance 
well, that wouldn't involve the use of the united states wires 
matlock is the reasonable police  well, go ahead. i shouldn't interrupt.
who was the  who was the  the candidate in that district after the district court plan?
maybe the opposite of mitigating is aggravating, but it  it's perfectly good english to say, mitigating? quite the contrary 
if there is a fourth amendment claim being raised in the criminal case, and of course, it might not be, but that is a very easy 
 justice scalia. it just has to be a lesser offense. and i would submit to the court that if we are analyzing a federal constitutional issue, then perhaps we  we should follow federal constitutional standards, which was stated  the strict elements test, in other words, because under  under federal law, it has to be, well, number one, a lesser-included offense, a true lesser-included offense, and under the schmoke case, this court has stated that that is in fact applying the strict elements 
of course, you could say the same thing about a voidable contract. you could say, you know, the whole contract is voidable.
i think  i think you're  i think you're agreeing with the petitioners. i think this  this whole thing is a great misunderstanding. you  you didn't  (laughter.)
you think there is a real party there that might be a virginia resident. and do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real party is called?
 since it's never going to come up, i don't think, i don't know i have to have a final conclusion.
 a rather basic question? what if i'm convinced that your opponent's reading is really only the fair reading of the statute, but i'm also convinced by you that that's not what congress intended. what should i do? (laughter.)
you don't know who wrote this either, do you? (laughter.)
justice breyer, that is correct.
counts.
yes.
if a juror finds  that is correct, justice stevens  if the juror's decided conclusion and reasoned moral judgment is that the mitigating factors and the aggravating factors are in balance, and finds that beyond a reasonable doubt, instruction number 10 clearly indicates that death is the appropriate sentence. so, it 
thank you, mr. bopp. the case is submitted.
well, maybe this needs  i mean, if were to clarify 
i  i see where you're going, and i  i see that there's some parallel. the problem in penry was that the jury  the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.
well, i would refer the court to pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point. and it says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged conduct on other persons even if those persons were oregonians who were harmed. but on 28(a) it says, official because the proposed jury did not accurately reflect the law, this is not a statement about philip morris's position, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to give it. so i think the court was quite clear in saying  let me complete my answer, because i think considering it moves the needle along the scale of allowable punishment for the harm to jesse williams, but it does not abandon the principle of proportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it is what you would do in a class action. you would punish for all the harms to all the oregonians. this is a one-way class action in which philip morris was exposed to global punishment by the jury without any of the protections of a class action. so 
mr. rovelli, you have 2 minutes remaining.
does your whole case turn on how shackling affects the argument that you're  that the accused is making that he's not dangerous, et cetera, or is there some other different standard that we could use to the effect, say, that it's just not consistent with the dignity in an american courtroom, something like that?
you're  you're talking without reference to the statute, and as i read the statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments made by a third party for health care items or services. so she has to turn over from her recovery what she got for health care, but we know that her tort claim consisted of a lot more. so if the federal statute says she has to turn over what she received from the third party for health care services, well, she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair allocation. so i don't see how you get from her the  a much larger share than what she got for health care.
then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process.
and what did they say?
i think i disagree with the characterization. there was a motion filed pretrial that contained a lengthy discussion of the law, which included discussion of various cases and alternatives to restraint that had been used. but that said, the motion itself is styled motion to have accused appear at trial free of restraints. the relief requested was that mr. deck should appear free of restraints both 
 of a cry for help, that wouldn't make it not testimony. and i don't think 
well, the  this court has made clear, in various cases, including in the very context of the exhaustion provision at issue here, in the booth versus churner decision, that there are no exceptions to the exhaustion  to an administrative exhaustion requirement when congress provides otherwise; that is, in the context of statutory, as opposed to a judge-made, exhaustion requirement. it is the case that what is required under the plra is exhaustion of available administrative remedies. so, under some of the hypotheticals that the court was suggesting  for example, if there were a 6-hour filing deadline; and, as far as i'm aware, there is no prison that has a 6-hour filing deadline  but, if there were, and in that particular case, for some reason, the prisoner were unable to comply with the deadline, because, for example, forms were unavailable or he was in a hospital bed, incapacitated, or he was in solitary confinement, i think it would be appropriate for a federal court to conclude that the remedy at issue was not available; and, therefore, that he didn't have to pursue that remedy; he would be able to get into federal court, assuming he had otherwise complied with the prison's procedural requirements.
i don't think it has to be absurd, it's just, i would measure it by what congress actually intended. assume there two permissible readings, and two  both of them make sense. and i'm convinced, assume i'm convinced by you, that they really intended to perpetuate the prior method of procedure. may i take that, may i come to that result even though i think the language really says exactly what your opponent says it says?
yes. that's entirely correct. and now, in the old days, before they amended the rule, you could compare the two and see what was changed, but now you can't. you can't tell what has been changed. and in this instance, we believe there's been a complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate courts can't tell what's going on. was there a reason for doing this? was deference given? was some other agenda at work in this decision? no one can tell because it is all off the record.
thank you, counsel. mr. phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.
the only reason being given to give a monopoly to local producers, that's their 
but you don't  but you don't get the answer from simply the text itself.
do you think the existence of the laws of  of  the existence of the lawsuit  of  of the presumption is what drives a lawsuit?
your honor, we 
yeah.
that's not the question. justice ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any other situation where when the federal agency doesn't do an adequate job, the state agency comes in?
yes, you could, your honor. but you should not address any of the alternative arguments raised by mr. katz.
 newspapers 
i don't think that it makes a constitutional difference under this court's cases whether or not the reason they decided to place the district there and give it that configuration was because they had a political agenda somewhere else. the  the fact of the matter is they  they were deliberately trying to create an hispanic majority district there, and to do it, they had to go all the way up to austin and grab 300,000 latinos and link them up with 
no, i don't 
 but i say no. i would say no, no.
oh, i know that wasn't  that wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the argument that you're making?
to the person. to what person?
the district court heard all of this, didn't it, all this evidence, and  and didn't the district court make a factual finding?
that's the california supreme court.
okay. under those circumstances, there were two questions. one is, of course, plain error, and the other is retroactivity.
yes.
i didn't think it did. they're just floating an idea. you know 
 not the consent approach, i take it. i didn't get an opportunity to ask the counsel who argued just previously. seemed to me that he argued consent when he answered justice stevens's question about the tax-evader. but he argued the overwhelming practical needs when he argued the rest of the case. and i thought i saw some tension in the argument there. and i take it the government does not embrace the consent argument?
well, the rule 
right. in  in that kind of situation, the facts that go to duress could also go to undermining the proof of the motive in that case, and in that situation, the government always has to prove the element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. but if the defendant wants to add to that a duress  a specific duress defense, then the burden of proof would be on the defendant to prove duress. now, normally in that 
in the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)? in other words, the school district which has only 57 students, it seems to me could be taken out of the calculation under (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more representative school districts, not the special case of the particularly isolated school district or whatever.
no, because that may very well be inconsistent with tinker. tinker articulates a baseline of political speech is, in fact, protected, subject to 
mr. chief justice, that's correct. the reasonableness prong is separate, and i think this court has  has long pronounced that the manner of executing a warrant may offend the constitution and vitiate the legality of a search.
5 and 6 of the reply brief.
interestingly enough, the government has told us that. and what they told us  and it's at page 4 of  and in a footnote number 3 from the amicus curiae's briefs from cruz. and the government has told us in cruz's pending certiorari petition that that  blue cross blue shield carriers do not perform outsourced government tasks, are not agents of the government, and do not act on behalf of opm. rather, they function as independent economic entities that offer and run their own health insurance plans, performing a role that is not governmental in nature.
 to the extent 
 guilt phase, and that's because defendant did not raise that issue in the trial court, did not move to have her alibi testimony admitted under the state statute that would have caused the court to address her prior 
just from my going through this record, i compare it with stenhart, with what's in congress. we have two cases here. and it's a fair conclusion that there are, in each case, before congress official and in here, there are some doctors who think this is safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe. and if you look at the  sort of by counting, by numbers, i guess if you look by lines of testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases and in front of congress who said it is not safe than there were when we considered the other case. and there are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other case. so i don't know if you're supposed to count doctors or what. my question would be, if this  do we owe more deference to a congressional finding or to congress than we owe to a state legislature? what is  i mean, i take it a state legislature is democratically elected, and don't we owe similar deference to both?
i'm not interested in what he said. i'm interested in what judge carter said 
but isn't that the reading of circuit?
yes. i think that 
the  the seventh circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation. so is that totally wrong, that you did do it  mention it in your briefs?
so are you requesting that there are insufficient fact findings here, so it should be returned 
yes, but you understand justice ginsburg's question surely, and i would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.
assuming there is an extraordinary circumstance, i think to prevent the result of having to issue and then immediately recall, i think the court in that circumstance, assuming there was actually an extraordinary circumstance, actual innocence of the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty, which we don't think was shown in this case  what the court could do in our view is to invoke its authority under rule 2 to suspend the rules for good cause. and in that circumstance, given the finality of the judgment, the good cause must rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice under calderon.
right.
now, the government talks about that the defendant can manufacture a defense, but you can do that in any case. you can manufacture a defense for a  for a plea of not guilty, as to  as to why you're not guilty. so it really doesn't make a difference. it would be the same thing for self-defense. in this particular case, instead of ms. dixon having bought the guns, if she had gotten a hold of one of mr. wright's guns and shot him, she would have had a self-defense, and if she had done that, then the burden of proof would have been on the government to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. but because she did the less blameworthy thing, that is, that she bought guns instead of shooting somebody or killing somebody, she is disadvantaged in  in the courtroom. because  because she raised duress, she then had to prove her defense by a preponderance of the evidence. and it's simply not 
you think just a symbolic display is less objectionable than quoting the text as this monument does?
but that would be true if he were in the legirons.
mr. phillips, you have 2 minutes remaining.
no. again, i believe that he  he asks  an individual could ask for an instruction in that case and still maintain that the state hasn't met the proof of  of establishing even the lesser. and there's nothing tactically contradictory about doing so. if  if one  if an attorney can convince the court to  to allow the jury to consider a lesser, and then still challenge that  the proof of that lesser 
a bivens suit is pretty hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of negligence.
don't you go back to the answer you gave me? sure, when taxes are involved, there may be an under-inclusive enforcement of certain individual rights, but they have to be under-enforced, because, otherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.
probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in federal courts that are hard to decipher. they don't know what it's about. they don't want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about nothing. that's the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this. so  and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed there's a special power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't state a claim or malicious. so why isn't this just an exercise of the sixth circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers? they're trying to figure out how to manage their docket.
no. i would like to take this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets out of the car, his dog comes with him.
which is a 
it would make it unlawful  unvoluntary. but, again 
okay. i gotcha.
it has nothing to do with whether the defendant thinks he is going to be hounded.
but if you're making a separate waiver argument, apart from the abrogation argument, i don't see why you would not make that waiver argument as broadly as possible. it's a separate argument from the abrogation argument.
 that justice breyer is correct.
this case  in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in douglas because at least in douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues. we don't even have that here. all we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. under the michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel. and so 
i don't think it fits into the way of this narrow case and the facts that are presented for immunity here, which the congress has been trying to stop forever, and the conduct's spread between 1997 and 2001 and was a massive violation that the securities laws really aren't cut out to address. i know i'm getting off your question a little bit, but in the nasdaq antitrust litigation these defendants and their predecessors agreed to keep the spreads wide in the over-the-counter market. there were rules about maximum spreads. there were many rules, many regulations. however, it was never permitted in the securities markets for all the underwriters across 5,000 stocks  we only proved it out to 1600  to widen their spreads, to keep their bids and offers wide. billions of dollars  the justice department after we brought the case, the justice department brought a case. the entire industry was changed. you can now trade a million dollars worth of stock for less than it costs to change your tire or something. and it's all due to the antitrust  i'm sorry, your honor.
mr. bland.
well, perhaps not as improvidently granted, but if there is  if the evidence comes in, under oregon law, and we are disavowing any reliance on the 
so, "in the event that my ruling on the sufficiency question is reversed on appeal, the court of appeals will know how i would have ruled on the new-trial motion, and the processing of the case can be expedited."
what  what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? it seems to me 
we believe that there has to be an objective, thoughtful, reasoned evaluation of her complaint of a violation. and that involves necessarily an evaluation in good faith of probable cause, a determination of whether probable cause exists, and an articulation of that determination 
thank you, mr. comey. mr. phillips.
i mean, and you practiced this for years. see. i mean, you're an expert in this, and i  i think my impression  just tell me if i'm wrong  is it's 803(1). it says a present sense impression comes in. so i guess it does unless i'm 
 i disagree with that.
what's the best court of appeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered? i haven't read any of them. tell me  tell me the best one. i'd like to read it.
all right. i'm saying you don't carry it to extremes. don't be ridiculous about it, but that isn't an extreme case we have. we have which is the case we have, the state, and then three state cases, and then referring to one state case that says that beck is  is a constitutional implication citing beck. i mean, i don't have to be extreme in order to say yours isn't that extreme example.
yes.
 a presumption.
yes.
 that i don't 
yes, but i'd go even further and say that the  if you had a big sign that said "park `n fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark. i mean, if it said, like, "jerry's airport parking, park and fly," i would say that's being a descriptive use. but some people may argue differently in that case.
no. that  that's  i said just the opposite. i said i  i don't know why we should begin looking for this  at this year only using this methodology. why shouldn't we average this methodology over the previous 7 years?
well, justice  justice ginsburg, the  the evidence wasn't available at the time of the original sentence. so the failure to have that part of the record at the time of the original sentencing hearing, of course, can't violate due process. and then the question would be, did something that happened later violate due process? but i just don't think it can be the case that anytime new evidence comes up that might cause a judge to say, boy, if we'd have had that evidence before when we  when we reached the sentencing decision, we might have reached a different result 
so  so that the only thing he  he's not claiming an economic injury, as i understand it, or am i wrong?
 is what you can take.
yes. yes. is it conceivable that we overlooked that point?
 to make sure i understand it. so you're  you're modifying your position of a minute ago in which you said the standard would be would the prosecution have been brought anyway, and you're now saying, which i think would be consistent with your answer to justice breyer, the  the question is would the investigators have tried to procure the prosecution anyway. and do i understand you correctly, and  and have you changed your position?
 if there are particular people in that office for a particular, separately called out program in that office that is focused on faith-based initiatives only, yes.
mr.  mr. lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, congress adopted the cable tv consumer protection act. and in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief. here we face silence. isn't that an indication that when congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the  in the measure?
with all due respect, i couldn't disagree more, because i think what has to be is that there has to be a direct comment to the suspect so that the suspect understands that this violation occurred, "it was a violation of your right, and we, the police, will not countenance what reese did. and here is what we will do. we will get you counsel, if you wish to have counsel. you are not facing the death penalty, young 17-year-old sitting in a cell in your underwear. that is not correct. here is what we can do for you. we will"  in fact, as this court suggests in the plurality opinion and seibert, you change location. you change the interrogator. you give him time. as this court said  in fact, justice scalia's  maybe dicta in mcneil said  you look at a lapse of time. you consider that there is a break in time. all of those factors may be  if all of those things were done, then you could become  begin to move closer to putting blake back in the position 
well, didn't the da say, look, youth alone doesn't  doesn't explain my reasons because there are other young people on the jury that  that we're not challenging, and  and i don't want to suggest that all young people should be disqualified?
his  your honor, the  the president's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of the statute, and he noted that in his signing memorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.
in that case, that would still violate the  the ssrs, if it is done as part of the registration process, which is what michigan does. michigan  even though you're properly ssrs registered, michigan still requires, under its ssrs form  it directs the carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make, model, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100 for that fee. if they pay $20, that exceeds the $10 maximum that congress set up in the ssrs in order to be qualified to operate in interstate trucking in the state of michigan, as an interstate carrier in  in michigan.
not  no, not that i'm aware of. obviously, in  in other circuits, we prevailed on the  the theory that the csra precludes review even of constitutional claims. and again, if i could return just for a moment to the  the point i was making earlier about the grievance procedure. congress has clearly manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and  and given that express congressional preference, it doesn't seem right for this court to assume that the grievance procedures won't work. and this seems to be an ideal example of a case that potentially implicates constitutional issues but that still falls squarely within the expertise of the union, the arbitrator, and the flra. that is, the dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so, what was the explanation? was it simply random deviations? was it potentially a  a glitch in the computer program that was used to generate a random list of names, or was there some invidious motivation as  as petitioner has suggested? the resolution of those types of questions falls entirely within the expertise of the participants in the grievance process even though constitutional law per se is not what labor arbitrators are best at. and so, i guess to  to return for a second to  to justice scalia's question about why shouldn't the csra be read to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims altogether. i mean, we certainly think that if  in a sense, that's  that's a debate we would be happy to lose. that is, the government has not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the court were looking for a  the simplest solution to the problem, that solution would be  have just as much to recommend it as petitioner's solution, which is that you go straight into federal district court. however, we don't think that congress has spoken with the degree of clarity that this court's decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of reconciling that presumption of judicial review with the comprehensive nature of the csra scheme is to provide that claims  constitutional claims are reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies. if the court has no further questions.
we have not asked that this court reconsider the decision in williamson county.
or you might try to get erisa amended. (laughter.)
 bankruptcy proceeding. how is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?
there are lots of things that congress could have done differently from what it did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection of the lea that we are talking about. and it doesn't create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what is to be disregarded is an lea as so defined.
but didn't  didn't congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the secretary could pay? what do you with the provision in  in (b) of  of the section that you were reading from? notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter. i mean, what  what money that the secretary expends is  is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?
does that mean that there was not enough?
no, mr. chief justice, because this is bloc voting at rates of 70 percent or higher, and after 1996, that 70 percent bloc went to 80 percent and then it went to 90 percent. and as the voters became increasingly disenchanted, i suppose, with the incumbent, that decline was steady. it didn't fluctuate up and down. it was going down and it went down even farther. mr. bonilla was always opposed by a latino candidate in each of his general elections that he's had since he's been elected. so that hasn't really been a factor for the voters. but as they became more cohesive and they reached 55 percent of the  the registration in the district, they were poised to elect their candidate of choice.
may i go back to my question? because there's a legal question here about what law we can look to under aedpa. and actually, of course, it is a question of whether aedpa applies, i suppose. because actually, wasn't this habeas petition filed two days before aedpa was  there's a footnote in the red brief that says  raises that question.
there was 
now, could you tell me when  the  the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy. right?
you may, mr. franklin. i think mr. hungar is next, mr. estrada.
not  not stacking charges you mean.
well, that  that example, which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. the problem that you've just been describing, the state convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 922, i regard that as a kind of a venue question because you can go back to the state that rendered the conviction and say, state, i was convicted in violation of the constitution, give me my good habeas writ that i get  can get from the state. then i wipe out that conviction and i don't have it anymore. but the person who's been convicted, say, in whatever examples  take  zimbabwe would be another example. libya. to go back to that system and get a conviction expunged. that's why you can't use a case within the u.s. system where it's a question of where do you go to wipe out your prior conviction. and for someone abroad, there isn't that option.
so, that  that is true, and then the effect of that is that firms that now do business in ohio won't build their new facility in wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in ohio. and that hurts businesses and others in wisconsin.
that's correct, your honor.
i think it would  there you would easily just look to this court's eighth amendment decisions which say 
well, i think if the statute requires that the aggravators outweigh mitigators, this court has upheld that formula. that is a decision that the jury has made. and the legislature can make that decision. and so, when you look  that's why i'm trying to  i mean, the state agrees that this is not a quantitative determination. and i will grant you, if the jury is  if it were a quantitative determination, which is totally unrealistic, and we agree with the state's reasoning on that  then if the jury is precisely exactly equivalent, 50-50, on aggravating and mitigating circumstances, that might be said to constitute a decision. but, as even the state argues, that's not how jury deliberations work. and under this equipoise provision, the jury can decree death without having made the individualized sentencing decision required at the selection stage. and it's because, on the one hand, if the decision is too close to call, the equipoise provision allows the jurors to simply give up and settle on equipoise as a group. this is a group decision, after all. they have to be unanimous on the question of whether aggravators 
it would be viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding conviction.
yes, we believe it's the plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. the point is, under the district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment was entered against us because the district court took petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination of fair use, that's the rule in the ninth circuit overall, and that's what needs to be affirmed.
i think that a prudential dismissal under article iii would also be fine, and that steel co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, at the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that there would not be relief allowed at the back end. and i think that there's no need for a remand to do this. we are really talking about an equitable rule that has governed equitable actions for 300 years. it is a 
maybe the eeoc regulation was not so much an interpretation of the statute as an interpretation of griggs.
this is very  make no other changes except that gillette has the dog and gillette with the dog go to mr. caballes' car.
that's absolutely correct, your honor. if  if the  if a reasonable jury knew that the semen belonged to mr.  belonged to mr. muncey and not mr. house, the result would be exactly the same because carolyn muncey's blood was all over mr. house's pants. that is an indisputable fact. and all of this 
there are  there are two fundamental reasons. the first is that it is a principal requirement of fifra, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that epa has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy. now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as mr. frederick indicated, represented a representation by epa to congress  and congress'  the  the committee report plainly indicates this  that the epa was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy. what they said was because the department of agriculture and the extension services and the state universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which congress has indicated correctly is very expensive 
no?
was there any case that said you can't look at the conference report at that time?
well, because here, in the example that i used, for example  it's certainly not the only one  it is the capacity to retrieve information that is stored otherwise. and that follows, your honor 
 but there's really no 
we would argue 
 the fraud gives him a competitive advantage not just over the, you know  his  his brother-in-law's company that he's trying to get at, but over everybody who's in the business.
and that was overruled.
your honor, we believe here that the debt limitation is a matter of local concern. it is the constitution of guam. and we are not suggesting that the court affirm an erroneous interpretation at all. this is a more than reasonable interpretation of a theory, well reasoned opinion by the guam supreme court. the guam supreme court has support, it's 17-year old superior court opinion that had reached the same conclusion. that was the only law out there that guamanians had looked to for the interpretation of those provisions of the organic act. it predated the 1993 appraisal. and it took that opinion and did not simply adopt it, but went through and did a very detailed analysis of the test of the statute of the organic act, the fact that it did not include the word assessed, which was used 10 months later by congress in the virgin islands.
no. the legislative history described in some detail in the antitrust institute's brief shows that actually they were returning the law to the per se rule against resale price maintenance because they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should be prohibited. this is  it is also true that 
there  there is nothing in the record. there was no type of polling. there was some  some expert testimony as to the potential reasons for people voting in a libertarian primary such as purposeful intent to do harm to libertarians or walking in intending to vote 
what are they? how many people are there? how many people are tested if you try to calculate it? how many 
no. my understanding from  from reading the treatises on  on malicious prosecution, for example, that there has been no watering down of the probable cause requirement because it is understood to be a critical check against 
i mean, that seems to be a solution, that the legislature can make it precise, although a court could not.
that's an important consequence.
well, what you should do is reverse the ninth circuit.
thank you, mr. radmore. ms. millet.
that's true.
no. i think the important  by the time defense counsel said that, the prosecutor in his opening statement had already made the send a message statement about five times. she was trying in that one limited instance to tackle that and say well, okay, if you give him life that's a message, too.
yes, your honor.
i do accept that, and i don't need to rely on a message. i would agree with the argument that you've advanced.
i don't see how  i mean, you know, given our prior discussion here, i don't see how that's the issue. because you say we have to assume that the defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.
in the  in the '97 case, was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)? because this 
well, that's not the sum total of our argument, your honor. i was just pointing out that actually there's a relatively narrow way to decide this case if the court so chose, by focusing on the reimbursement claim in this case. our position is that parents share in the substantive right to a free appropriate public education under the act. and there are two things we would point to in regard to the definition of a free appropriate public education that we think makes this clear. and this is in section 1401 of the act on pages 2a and 4a of petitioner's brief. the first is the definition says that the term free appropriate public education means special education services provided, quote, without charge and at no cost to parents. we think clearly the free aspect, again, is first and foremost a right of the parents, because they're the ones that bear the cost. with regard to 
now, there's some dispute as to whether that  that is really what  what it held. and there's a big difference. if  if you just say whenever you  whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this  this third party is not just  it's the comparative weakness of the third party case. you don't blind yourself to  to the strength of the prosecution's case. will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was  was referring to? are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?
because the michigan court of appeals, unlike the michigan supreme court, is an error-correcting court. and so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit. and the michigan court of appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.
 rejected in seibert 
so it's a misnomer to say it's a mere free crime criterion? it's free crime plus some further fact?
but isn't it the california supreme court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance? and here, this is puzzling about this case. defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer, "don't argue any mitigators. i'd just as soon die as spend my life in prison." so, no mitigators were argued. so then, even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh against those correct aggregators. so, what mitigation is there to weigh against the valid aggravators?
the  i think the argument, your honor, would be the same. it's just  it's a particularly stark illustration here of the dangers of the  of  of that position. it may not  you're absolutely right. it may not always be the case that the  that the challenge to the contract is going to be the merits dispute in itself, but i think where, as here, it is, it really shows how pernicious this rule is and precisely why the prima paint rule, which again has been in effect almost 40 years now  why that approach works and actually promotes the policy supporting arbitration. and when you  again, when you think of an alternative rule, it's one in which you could come in  the party who has concededly agreed to an arbitration clause and says, well, i think the underlying contract is void on public policy grounds, which again you can make in virtually any case. under the florida supreme court's rationale in this court  in this case, that is a basis for remaining in court, and 
 within your 
the kansas supreme court's 
all right.
well, your comment about the defendant running out of a funds is  raises a good point. so the remedy would be an automatic reversal in a case like that where the defendant would be represented by appointed counsel?
retaliation, what is retaliation? isn't retaliation statutory?
did you seek a more specific statement?
no, it does not, your honor.
certainly if this were done in the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first place.
i'm sorry.
you think there's a uniform federal definition of a theft offense?
 maybe all that it takes.
say you were a 
i think it was pointed out that, in flast, at least, you were dealing with the same spending on the part of the federal government. here, you have apples and oranges. the property tax is quite discrete from the investment tax credit.
but  but the semen was used to  to connect it to the  to the defendant, and we now know that that's wrong.
your honor, i  to me there's a threshold question of whether a general building regulation of that type really would be a  a regulation that would implicate the takings clause at all.
why doesn't it?
we cite in footnote 4 a small number of cases from prior to the last rule change in which that occurred. in addition, there are at least a couple of cases since the rule change in which the tax court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the findings. we're not aware of any cases in which the tax court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other cases  little against commissioner, 103 t.c. 285; walker against commissioner, 101 t.c. 537  in which the tax court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to decide the case in the manner he or she thought 
right, your honor, and  and that  that might present a different case.
justice breyer, because the harm that is being weighed here is the harm of urgently providing care to this minor who needs it, as opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get at, which is notification of parents. it's not whether or not the minor can have an abortion. the minor can always go forward and have an abortion under these circumstances. so people aren't weighing the right of the fetus, in this instance, to the right of the mother's health. so the weighing is quite easy. and if given the opportunity, my office would be prepared to issue an opinion as to the applicability of this defense.
well, but in this case, if we look at what the ninth circuit said, for example, when it got to step two, it said that the employee could only be disciplined if the  if the agency could show that there was disruption or reckless disregard for the truth. but when somebody is actually carrying out his job duties  not engaged in outside activities that may reflect back and be disruptive, but engaged in the job duties themselves, the employer has a right to insist on more than that the employee not be disruptive or reckless; he has a right to insist that  the employer has a right to insist that the employee affirmatively contribute to the work of the office and exercise good judgment. and the  and the supervisor has to be in a position to make judgments about whether that judgment was good or not.
yes, your honor, and actually that's one of the inquiries that boyde required, is that you look at the instruction itself, the other instructions, and that's an inquiry the california supreme court did, in fact, conduct. and that is, the jury was presented with  with a instruction that said, you shall consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and nothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited the jury's consideration of payton's mitigating evidence or precluded  pardon me 
but it doesn't go to premeditation. i think that's justice ginsburg's point. and i don't see why that isn't correct. it doesn't got to premeditation.
if you come across anything that would use that, i mean "reckless" itself is unclear. the model penal code tried to clarify it based on this court's opinions primarily.
but it takes a step of reasoning beyond merely saying we incorporate the  the affidavit into the warrant.
he wants me to point out to the court that, in addition to  it's always nice to have help. in addition to the great american federal savings & loan case, justice scalia, which indicated that the implied repeal analysis is not appropriate when you're talking about a subsequent simply remedial provision that doesn't withdraw substantive rights, the court in a case authored i believe by your honor, rancho palos verdes, in footnote 2 made that same point last term.
but why can't it make an adjustment in this case, mr. phillips.
well, let me put it this way. i don't know why one case is so easier than the other.
all right. why isn't that the end of it? so 
i agree with that, justice souter. i think that to apply the default in these circumstances where everyone was plainly aware of his concerns about the inadequacy of the verdict form in special  and the special issues, would be imposing too high and too excessively burdensome a requirement for the preservation of the federal right. i do also want to argue that there is a 
so you think it's  it's not  it's not required for police interrogators in the station to include this? they can  they can wait?
 act.
well, what a legislature might think, well, now this finley has  we've been  taken care of that. and your case looks very much the same in terms of breaking up a lawsuit into two when it makes sense to try it all together. so we think that  that old case should go just the way finley went. and the same thing with zahn because, after all, zahn doesn't fit very well with ben hur. if you're saying that the strawbridge rule  i mean, what really counts is diversity, and  and ben hur says the only named representative citizenship counts and yet the amount-in-controversy, the lesser thing in your view  every single member of the class has to meet that amount, but only the named representatives have to be of diverse citizenship.
well, as mr. chief justice pointed out, three family members of the victim sitting in the front row, buttons or not, the buttons don't add  add little, if anything, to the three victim's family members sitting there grieving through a trial. they add very little, for instance, in this case 
it is.
and the prior administer of the dea before that had our position. so, this is an area where i think, you know, there are different approaches to this. what i wanted to make clear, though, is, you're absolutely right that the regulation of medicine is  this court has observed  is traditionally left to the states. but that has to be reconciled with the fact that for 90 years the federal government has had a prominent role in the regulation of controlled substances. and it's been clear 
well, i think you 
you don't  you don't assert that this  that it  that this couldn't be done. you just 
well, when you say full enjoyment, you  you think when  when i'm taxed on something, i  i don't have full enjoyment of it? the only thing triggered by age, as far as i can tell  the only thing triggered by age  is your obtaining of a tax benefit. that's all. once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without  without paying the 10 percent tax.
mr. draper, could i ask you what is a matter of procedure? what is your understanding of  of how one would go about challenging the river master's decision if one disagreed with it? do you go to the special master? do you come direct to this court?
let me just get  get straight what  what the  what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?
this will begin in 2007, as i recall. is that 
i would have thought the answer was no. and therefore, this isn't just a small error of a technical sort. the ninth circuit is official completely wrong and not even close. and therefore, if they're not even close, can the government come up here where there's an obvious error and they decide, the government, that it would like to have a declaration by this court on a matter that they think is quite interesting and important to them in a lot of other cases where they can't win the cases easily? that's, i'm putting it a little pejoratively because i'm trying to get you to see what i'm driving at. it's like a hoked-up case. why not? i'm using it pejoratively only so that you can see what i'm worried about.
but your  your theory is there is regulatory authority because there's an interaction between the wetlands or the lands in question and the navigable waters.
sure, it may come out the way  it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say that the supreme court, any supreme court case bears upon it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the first amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or 
yes, justice o'connor, and  -
precisely. that's the point he makes in his footnote. he acknowledges what the subcommittee did. but it's  it's important to know representative kastenmeier was a member of this subcommittee. the federal courts study committee is not congress. it's merely an advisory body.
well, i think that they have a very significant difference, an important function in ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is what congress intended it to do.
it's not clear  it's not clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory aspect of it, not  and not the inducement part of it  it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is. what do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a substantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if there's any part?
 we didn't cite the en banc decision. we cited the panel decision 
so, is this a one-of-a-kind case? i mean, you said, in your brief, that the ninth circuit decision threatens many other valid california death judgments. but these would all have to be rather ancient cases.
yes, but olson was a standing case. olson was not confronting this situation. in olson, the police simply went in without a warrant. and the argument was made that this person was not the normal inhabitant of the  what was he? a houseguest or something of the sort. and the only issue that olson addressed was his right to raise a fourth amendment claim. it did not respond to the issue that you are raising, which is the reasonable extent of search.
no, justice breyer. both sides agree that slusa, section 77p(d)(4) 
okay, and let me 
yes.
exactly. exactly. exactly. and i think it's the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor files a plan and gets it confirmed, pays creditors, and everybody winds up better off. official
it has been endorsed by the eeoc, though.
mr. schwartz, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 principle.
is it reasonable for him to suppose that there might be something more going on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a speeding ticket? that presents he presents a danger to the community quite apart from the driving?
explain why it would be a minor variation if what he has identified as a defect in the pipe system and what turns out to be the situation that was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused the loss?
obviously, a croupier has such a connection.
that's exactly right. that's exactly right. to  to try to  to try to not have to argue that, as justice o'connor's initial question to me supposed, that all of that prior case law, prior to franchise tax board and merrell dow, somehow would go out the window sub silentio. and that's not what we are arguing.
well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't  couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?
so, there definitely is a case before us, then.
precisely the same under our interpretation of 
they are being denied admission to the school of their choice?
but that 
there's no  there's nothing that indicates one way or the other what  what is a preferable system to operate. and that's why i think this is intensely a legislative judgement.
 claim that would satisfy 
so if  if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the  why would any litigant ever do that? why would any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the fcc and you do get fees in court? wouldn't the presumption be that it would work the same way whether you go to the agency, federal agency, or federal or state court, that you're in the same situation as respect to fees?
i would agree, your honor. i  i think the  the fact that they're not there  here the court 
make it up on volume, i think.
thank you, counsel. mr. stris.
it was december the 8th is whenever it began, and then pursuant to the court's  the trial court's order that was entered in that case, the state's response came on december 19th. the court ruled on december 23rd. the rehearing was denied on the 30th, and we filed our briefs in the florida supreme court on january 3rd.
 least of your concerns. it's the fact that the government is establishing it that's the principal concern.
because if you were going to be 6 strict about it  and  and i'm not sure i understand 7 all of the parameters of the hypothetical  in 
 was  in st. cyr, i think it was he pled guilty under one set of expectations, and that's what the court fastened on. isn't that so?
20 percent of the park is under water. right?
even  wasn't this man  magistrate told we've set this whole thing up? we've put this package in the mail. it's going to be delivered at such and such a time. wasn't the magistrate told that?
the california supreme court decided whether those legal propositions were relevant under the state constitution and the state compensation 
well, but your  your point is  is there  is that they have to go out and come back in again.
no, of course, but 
 what you have here.
but mr. grant, i'm a little puzzled. why is the discovery in the federal system any less valuable in the state system?
the difficulty, i guess, is that i'm having is let's imagine rule 19 or 24.
well, the  both the donning and the doffing and the walking in between and the wait for the equipment, which is the bulk of the time in all these cases, would be compensable. the department of labor has regulations 
i don't think that action wouldn't be permitted to proceed.
right, but normally you assume, i guess, that congress does what is  tries to avoid things that are ridiculous. so if they say keep the park, i guess the question would be is that included. i mean 
well, except the workers who had already been injured in the past 
yeah, but that wasn't my hypo. as i understand it, in that case he keeps going after bobo, period. and in my case at stage two, having learned something, he identifies y. and i  so i don't see the justification, what is the justification?
we're exploring initially what the rule ought to be.
mr. stancil.
that is true. but i think that the intent of congress was the same as this court, all the members of this court, recognized in lamagno. in lamagno, even the dissenters, the plurality, all acknowledged what congress intended by the "conclusive for purposes of removal" language was to prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case. once it was removed, it was to stay in federal court. that was what congress intended. and one reason 
we'll give you an extra 30 seconds. proceed.
i would be very surprised if the court found you were out of time because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.
as i understand it, our question is, if a jury could return the death verdict in the equipoise situation, as the kansas supreme court has defined it, is that  is that statute allowing for that possibility constitutional? isn't that 
well, i don't think the singling out  i don't think whether it's discrete and identifiable depends on the amount, your honor. i think it depends on how  whether there is a way  and this really is part of both traceability and redressability. there has to be a way to identify the expenditure that the taxpayer is seeking to enjoin. and if there is some separate government grant for the building of a church, yes, if it's  if  if there is some religious 
no, not at all. they 
and, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not  there is no article that i could find in bankruptcy journal.
so, is the statute  i saw something here, that a person who's going to get this offset, and he has social security, you exempt $9,000 of the social security, and then you limit it to 15 percent of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is less.
yes.
do you disagree with that?
you're saying here the state should therefore sue, if i understand you.
was what?
yes.
may i ask about the first one? does the constitution require there be no involuntary?
 overlooked that? i just don't get it.
that's correct.
well, justice scalia, i actually disagree with your characterization and would like to point you to a couple of precedents. the benz and mcculloch cases, which are very important to the respondents, were very important to the fifth circuit, embody the principle that you just described, to some extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in our waters, we will not apply the nlra to the labor contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel. but when americans are involved, we do apply the nlra, and that's the ariadne precedent that the  and  and in fact, ariadne is the most on-point case because it 
i don't think so, justice ginsburg, but let me just be clear. i don't think it's just a matter of this executive order that's challenged in this case and congress could have enacted that into statute. as i understand it, the  what is really at issue here is not the executive order. it is the way that certain conferences were conducted by executive branch officials. that's what the dispute 
in all candor, i don't know. there's no finding. they simply said denied.
because of the specific requirements of erisa litigation. 502(a)(3) doesn't say that you can bring any claim in equity. it says that we can bring a claim seeking appropriate equitable relief to remedy a violation of the plan or to enforce the terms of the plan. so there is a necessary joining of equity and the terms of the plan when you bring 
so where would you  where would  where would you put the line?
in the federal court in my hypo 
the latter 
the ilecs do, we don't.
that's certainly correct, your honor, there can be no appeal without a final judgment. but what i'm saying is that an interpretation of rule 50, as a whole, which says to the trial court judge that a judgment should be entered without resolving the question of whether there is sufficient evidence, and then take that up later, under rule 50(b), isn't a very good way to proceed.
as a 
is this corporation a texas corporation? the one you sued.
even though in the individual cases the students, including minority students, and i gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race?
i  i think we can look at a much narrower approach that also evolves out of this particular judgment as determined by the trial court. there was essentially a  a lack of persuasive assurances of trustworthiness in the statements that were, in fact, given. they lacked corroboration, the particular statements that were alleged to have been given by jimmy mccaw white, in ways similar to situations where evidence should not be deemed relevantly admissible because of that lack of reliability and trustworthiness.
well, again, your honor, this language was adopted at a time when they followed the exception 
because 
 individual actions and small state class actions.
 which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor. now, he's thinking, "why is that? what is that package doctrine?" and the answer is, the dormant commerce clause  it's part of the dormant commerce clause  the dormant commerce clause is the implication from the existence of the commerce power in the constitution. so if we have an amendment that says "that aspect of the dormant commerce clause doesn't apply," that means the dormant commerce clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant commerce clause into six different parts, or even two.
no. i'm asking about just the words, any court. what's your best case for the proposition that that would normally be construed by congress to include foreign courts?
if you sell to another distributor, you're not being 
you may find another one.
 are there authorities in these other states to the contrary? i'm surprised if there is.
cases involving those questions would have to go to the courts, i assume. but they'd be a small percentage of all the cases that would go to the courts if we adopt your position. i agree, there will still be some cases left that'll have to go to the courts to sort out these questions that you mentioned. but that's going to be a small percentage of the totality.
justice breyer 
your honor is absolutely correct. osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from 1447(c). our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). that although the district court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense. and this court held precisely that in the oliver american trading case. there, a case removed by mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this court. yet this court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the federal courts qua federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in state court as well. likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune. when congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to state court which would be free to disregard the federal court's decision.
 your honor.
the best case we cite in our brief is green v. georgia.
so the argument  the question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly different area from district 23.
oh, okay.
 but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. this was the only one that would. and it  justice souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. the law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. but let's suppose that you're right, generally. if there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?
assuming you make the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about the availability of equitable tolling.
well 
if there isn't enough in the way of facts alleged to permit a court to understand what it is you're claiming in general terms happening, then you haven't satisfied rule 8. i mean 
i would. thank you very much.
well, can't 
yes, your honor.
what's your best case for the proposition that an agency and not the congress defines the extent of field preemption?
all right. right. so 
 outweighed by mitigators.
 later. get to the general  first get to the general issue. does the applicant for the injunction have the burden to negate the probability that the government will prevail in its affirmative defense, ultimately?
no. i guess  i think this court is going to tell us. i think the  the pace v. diguglielmo case that this court heard  i think it was last month 
what does the  what does the inmate have to show in order to go to the law library? that is, suppose the inmate's position is i want to go there and i want to read law week and legal times and other  i want to see what's new, what's breaking in the law so that maybe i'll have something i can put in a petition, and that's why i want to go every  every chance i get to the law library. could such an inmate go to the library?
mr. taranto 
the claim for the  if we're assuming it's a mispacking of the mail into the truck, is the 
 as is the case here? and, also, what if the employee 
counsel, much of your case hinges on the assumption that congress incorporated the erisa definition into the bankruptcy code. what  what is your strongest evidence for that?
the pre-petition contract, but not out of pre-petition conduct.
well, just as to that, the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you say it wasn't drafted by the department of education?
so let's say you had an organization that every month of every year it took out an ad the first week of every month, and it said the same thing and it said, contact your senators. this issue is important to us. and they do that every month. all of a sudden, their ad's nature changes because an election is  happens to be coming up and it's illegal the month before the election, even though it was clearly something that they did without regard to the election.
race-neutral alternatives for what? to accomplish what?
i don't know the answer.
that's exactly my point, your honor. and  and 
well, i think it is wrong on two levels. one is, i don't know why you would need to have proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight official cause, which is what missouri thinks the in whole or in part means, then you can just say slight cause when you're describing the contributory negligence.
right. and  and perhaps if we prevail and the state elects to pursue its own remedy on its own, we'll have another round of litigation.
i think that's something reasonable, but in this case it is unreasonable because you simply don't have the opportunity to register. remember this 
i think 
isn't a civil lawsuit bringable?
with regard to the fifth amendment rights, if they are not in custody, then  or even if they are  i don't think that that would necessarily  the  any expectation of privacy would preclude the imposition of a lie-detector test, no.
what the  the department distinguishes 
yeah. and what  i think that what  what this boils down to  and i'm skipping ahead of myself  is that the tribe would like to be able to market a product without having to pay the burdens of taxation all the way upstream. there are taxes on the distributors' property, there's taxes that are imposed when the fuel comes out of the ground and at the refinery stage. so, the tribe would like to market a product unburdened by any upstream taxation, the cost of doing business 
absolutely not. because? because?
i mean, i think they make the  as a practical  is there text in the domestic mail manual that specifically says, "put it where somebody won't slip"? no. i think it's the same judgment that's being made. they're making the best judgments that they can, but there is  you know, they're, sort of, caught between them. so, they need to put it somewhere where it's sheltered, and that tends to be close up to buildings. and the problem is, it's not 
and you think that was wrong.
right. i think all parties have noted, your honor, that the  under the ssrs it's much more stringent, more rigorous 
yes. [laughter.]
justice kennedy, if it's an extension, it's i think implicit in bivens' logic. bivens deals with the cases 
yes, it does, your honor.
 talking about "against the weight," because a trial judge would rarely be  if it  if a trial judge said, "it's against the weight of the evidence," it would go back for a new trial, and you couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through the whole second trial. but why isn't it like  i think there are decisions that say there was a judgment, but the court of appeals determines there was never a claim for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made to that effect. the idea of a court affirming a judgment that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.
and  and the reason that it's not 
against the state?
sure.
sure. you can use it again.
it would depend on whether there is an implied covenant, your honor. it wasn't 
what report goes to the chief judge?
it's not exactly on all fours with this case, but we think the fair inference, when you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds of statements were kept out, is that if they simply  if the police or their agents were able to get the statement just a little bit sooner, the answer would have been the same. and we do have cases, justice scalia, where people made fresh accusations or cry-outs to private parties to  to another  to a witness who wasn't even associated with law enforcement, and we have a whole section of our brief pointing out that for decades after the founding, even those kinds of statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials for the reason 
typically it is a matter of state to state complaints or apologies and 
no, your honor. my  what i  the point i meant to make was that we're not urging that relief can never lie because there's a general rule of application.
number of hearings.
that's correct, justice scalia.
well, actually, your honor, every lower court to consider the language has found that the retroactivity decision need not be made by this court, and the reason for that is the difference between the language in paragraph 6(3) and in the second or successive provision in paragraph 8(2). in paragraph 8(2), it explicitly states that it has to be made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court.
 do you think it's open to a state to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of proof under this statute?
yes.
that 
but this statute doesn't  it's not worded the way the  the  paragraph 6 as a whole says you have the later of four dates. it names four different things. but subparagraph (3) doesn't say, well, the later of any of these things. it  it tells you if the condition is satisfied then you  the question is  okay, the if condition is satisfied. i can use paragraph (3). what's my time limit? and it says the date on which  1 year from the date on which the right was initially recognized by the supreme court, and that's the date he has. if the  if  if it turns out that he can't use it because the appropriate thing doesn't happen till later, then he just can't use that date. he has three other possible dates to use under paragraph (6) 
if the court concludes the brooke group applies to this case, then the instruction was incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be entitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case.
graham didn't win his case.
i would contend, your honor, that the court needs to very clearly explain that the guidelines are, are a reference. they are 
yes, justice souter.
and if the court says, yes, based on the evidence before me, it would have been futile, do you think fourth amendment reasonableness requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand the knock anyway?
so then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose. they are going to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out if they are going to have to answer any claim for damages.
i 
which really has very little probative value on this issue. i mean, the fact that he tried to saw his way out of a cell hardly speaks to the risk of fleeing from the courtroom while the proceedings are going on.
no, your honor, i  i don't believe so because i think if, for instance, the legislature said, you  you shall, absent some compelling need, provide prisoners with a diet that meets their religious requirements, that would not discriminate among religions. it would be narrowly tailored to some perceived problem that might exist.
don't you have  don't you have to address aedpa before we get to that question?
the burden is on the jury to find something to outweigh it. and, in the absence of a finding of something that outweighs it, when these aggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper penalty.
your honor, we  and we have cited authority, including the leocal decision of this court, last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes, where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that the narrower reading be the one that is written. so, in other words, if this court were to have concluded, in blue chip  excuse me  in united states versus o'hagan, that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with" language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a particular party in the case, that is a broader reading than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil case. and so, what we're urging is that the rule of lenity would suggest that, if this court, in u.s. v. o'hagan, took the view that the "purchase or sale" requirement does not apply in a criminal context, that should also apply in a civil context, that a narrower reading should not be imparted into a civil context than you would find in a criminal context. we also 
we would  we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction. that is, this court has often said that it's the fundamental duty of this court when doubt is  when doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes. and that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, over which this court would not have appellate jurisdiction. for example, situations sometimes arise, particularly in cases that are adjudicated by three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this court or should go instead to the court of appeals. and if somebody comes to this court and this court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. this court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.
i'm sure that it is.
just some, any without violating the constitution.
if  i see what you're driving at in terms of the procedure. we are focusing on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no matter what, right? official
mr. waxman 
thank you, counsel. mr. gornstein.
that is  we do not know. there  even though we do not know 
but the question 
some of them did. some went down 
yes, your honor, i understand your question. (laughter.)
that's absolutely right, justice souter.
what it is is recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the illegal act. what it's saying is that not everything that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the illegal act.
uh-huh.
that's correct.
either 
well, that's rather important, don't you think?
well, i think that we would agree with the state of oregon that a necessary implication of the oregon supreme court's holding, albeit unstated, was that a defendant is constitutionally entitled to argue residual doubt, as well as to present evidence of residual doubt. were that not true, the failure to admit the evidence would, in some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly to some extent, that the mere presentation of the evidence might lead to the jury taking it into account even absent an argument or instruction to that effect. but, as a practical matter, this court has never distinguished, in its consideration of mitigating factors, between the presentation of argument or evidence and obtaining 
 question, justice.
well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? this marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.
that's right. the reason for that is, there isn't a predonning wait in the alvarez case, where the plaintiffs won, and the tum plaintiffs lost on an unrelated theory that the actual donning and doffing couldn't start the workday.
fair question, justice scalia, and that brings us back to the language of the statute, where of course we begin, and we have to look precisely to the language of the statute. the language of the statute, what petitioners mistake is that the language of the statute here has a two-part process. we don't look at leas first. it doesn't say 5th percentile of leas. we have to first rank expenditures or revenues in the state. it's above 95th percentile or below 5th percentile of the expenditures.
and the purchaser from that purchaser the same. in other words, if flowers had sold to x, then x has to make the same inquiry because he sees i guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale. so before a purchaser can purchase from flowers, that purchaser too must see whether or not they hired an outside agency and so forth.
no, your honor. the knock-and-announce requirement is  we take no issue with that. that is required by the fourth amendment. with regard 
i think it depends on the reasons that the agency gave. and one of the reasons that the agency gave was the substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change. petitioners acknowledge that that was an appropriate consideration for the agency. so even if you think the other considerations were inappropriate, and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are, the agency gave an appropriate reason. and that reasons 
well, again, we don't believe that the court needs to address that question.
yes, your honor. i understand the hypothetical, at least  especially as to the first half, which links to justice breyer's earlier question. there is an enormous difference, under this court's jurisprudence, between antidiscrimination laws and the sort of law we have here, the solomon amendment. and the difference is, the government  it is both on the need side and on the infringement side. on the need side, the government has a compelling interest that is different from just regulating the conduct. the compelling interest that the government has is a completely separate interest in seeing to it that not a penny of federal money ever goes to support an institution that taxpayers would not be in a position to go to. that's bob jones and norwood. and, on the infringement side, this court has said, that the act of discriminating against individuals is entitled to no first-amendment protection, regardless of whether there's a first-amendment right at stake. and i should add, also, that the vast majority of schools that are subject to title vi or to title ix have no such expression that is at stake. they are not articulating a message, "we really need to discriminate on the basis of race or on the basis of gender."
i'm not actually talking about waiver. my question was just generally what i asked. what is the standard there on whether you get a hearing?
but is it not true that the colorado legislature could create such a right if it did it with sufficient specificity?
but justice breyer, that  that long been delayed period runs all the way back to 1998. and we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001. so the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing about what mr. notebaert was  was revealing in march and april and june of 2001. it, it could potentially, but it equally, it couldn't. it's the same problem you get with the 5500, where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite plausible that mr. notebaert never saw those reports. now how you can make that concession and nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.
the second point is definiteness, it's enablement.
yes. oh, yes. well, there would be a prohibition in that case if i understand your 
of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.
right. but you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case. what, what your spending clause argument is, the state agreed to undertake this liability, that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education, that if they litigated, they would have pay the other side's attorneys' fees. but if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the parents could prosecute it, and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense, well, in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all. that seems a little implausible.
that's true. and if you look at the diehr case, it's a perfect example because diehr had more steps but it was absolutely true in diehr that every single step, including the mathematical equation, was part of the prior art. and this court said that's potentially patentable because you have found a way to put all these disparate things together in a way that makes them potentially useful.
and the hearer of  at the trial did have that opportunity.
may i ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your  something that you said? i asked you, are you dividing the burden of production and persuasion? and you said no, it's all on one side or the other. but it seems to me your description of this proceeding, you said the school district goes first. so 
right.
 compensable as part of that.
and if you win on that, you win. and if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably fall.
it is a combined question of law and fact in our view, because as i said the section 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be used to establish an agreement. if all they have alleged is parallel action without more 
let me deal with the premise that congress threw this into the lap of the fcc, and also how it is they propose to deal with it, on that assumption. the answer is, they did not throw it into the lap of the fcc. the '96 act enacted these definitions, which are very carefully calibrated, for which there is no text  textual support. i will come back to "offering." but congress did enact a specific provision in mci versus at&t. it addressed not only the concern of the majority, but also the concerns of the dissenters, that the commission needed some flexibility. and it told the commission how to address this problem. it said, in the forbearance procedures, "here are the rules that you will apply in deciding to lift regulation." they're quite detailed. they're  now, let me take you to them again  they're at the end of our  i'm sorry, they are at  in our appendix, at 3a. this is what congress said. congress said, "we recognize the commission needs some flexibility, but there are going to be rules, and there are going to be rules so courts can, for example, review, later on, whether or not you're actually applying what we  doing what you want  what we wanted you to do." and here's what the commission has to do, according to congress. and it's what the commission did not do here. i'm going to start with the indented paragraphs, 1, 2, and 3, and then subparagraph b. it told the commission to look at whether or not the former regulation is not necessary to ensure that the charges  and skipping again  are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. paragraph 2, they have to make sure it's not necessary for the protection of consumers, that it's in the public interest, and that the competitive effects will be positive rather than negative. the commission did none of this, notwithstanding that congress specifically directed them to. now, let me then turn to the question of whether or not this is a reasonable interpretation of "offering." now, in different contexts, i admit, it's conceivable to come up with different meanings of "offerings," but this is a context, and i think if you take any example where congress actually  i've given you the common carrier. i don't think the railroad could ever get away with saying it. i gave you the examples of the computer inquiries and the at&t mfj, which are on point. but take anything that congress regulates. take, for example, the fact that we regulate offering of cigarettes to children. now, a merchandiser couldn't come along and say, "i'm not offering cigarettes. what i've done is, i've created a smoking service. i've taken the cigarettes, and i've put a lighter in it, and you've just got one bill that you have to pay for it." the idea that that would evade what congress is concerned about is loopy. think about what congress is concerned about with common-carriage regulations. there are three principal consequences to being a telecommunications service. and imagine if any of them changed a whit, except to favor us, when you bundle the e-mail with it. first, nondiscrimination. would congress want you to have to charge just and reasonable rates to a competitor any less when you're selling e-mail with the telecommunications than the telecommunications alone? no. interconnection. would congress want a cable modem service network to be less interconnected with all the other networks simply because it has e-mail or a web browser on it? i don't know why, i suppose congress would want to be more sure, because there are more messages.
where is that?
no. there's no nexus there.
 you really want the system to run that way?
that's 
no, but i've never heard of a state without law. there is no 
i don't think you, your honor. given that 
it would be a different 
all right, but it's acquired. say  say retirement, not old age. i mean, you know, 60  it's not that bad  (laughter.)
but is it right  i mean, you couldn't  you could not  unless the icj decision gave a right to an individual, and you had no claim under the federal habeas statute  and it is unusual, is it not, for a judgement of the international court of justice to recognize the right of an individual, as opposed to being just a judgement between nations?
 i could understand that if they  it would be an easier question for me if the statute said, "even if you violate the statute, if you otherwise use reasonable care, no liability." but here, it talks about reasonable care when you are  when you are, in the statutory phrase, in the execution of the statute, which suggests to me you're not violating the statute, you're not violating any standard. so, what function does it serve?
i think that's exactly right. and it's hard to  i mean, that is  you know, what happens here when i show up with oversized mail, as a mail carrier? i've got the choice of delaying your receipt of the mail by taking it back to the postal service, inconveniencing you, making you come downtown. that act is within the exception. i can try a person-to-person delivery. but the postal service went away from that, for logical reasons, because that will delay everybody else's mail, and there's no liability for all of those delays. if you set this same package down, and it has medicine or food in it  it says  marked "perishable" on the outside  it's in the sun, it goes rotten, the person gets sick, there's no liability. but the  this is a protection for an activity of the government, like the  many of the other federal tort claim act exceptions. and the protection for that activity is an upfront protection that doesn't turn on the happenstance of which particular form of injury is manifested at  hours later. and it's an important reason, as i said, not only for the sheer volume of claims that we could face if this is opened up on how we deliver, but all  our inability to defend, when, two years later, we simply do not  unlike fedex or ups, or probably the pizza delivery, we can't recreate, months later, how we delivered the mail 
suppose i have a company and i know that the pattern is, i'm going to be audited every five years by the irs. and in year four, i  one year  one year before the investigation, i instruct my bookkeeping staff, "keep everything you need to document our expenses, but destroy everything that's remotely related to that, or indirectly related to that. give them just a clean, simple file. destroy anything that's  all supporting documentation. give them what they need and what they're entitled to have, but nothing else. and step up that policy, because they're going to be here next year." under your  it seems to me that that violates your rule.
mr. chief justice, i don't believe so. it's not that one reason. it's a combination of reasons. if you consider the fact that the state was aware it had benefited from a clear factual error with the fact that the docket was returned to the court of appeals reflected on the docket sheet, with the fact that the state itself initiated collateral litigation in the fall of 2003 to preclude the federal public defenders office from representing mr. thompson in the state court competency proceedings. and even their brief, the wolfel case that they cite says that alone might be a reason a court of appeals might want to hold onto its mandate because it was an issue that was immediately relevant on  on remand in the state court proceedings.
the ada could allow equitable remedies, but  could certainly 
and i don't understand how you're setting off the district court from the court of appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it affirmed the judgment of the district court.
yes, it is. with the 
he does not have a first amendment right not to be singled out in those circumstances.
now  i  dr. blake, you just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.
thank you, mr. kneedler. the case is submitted.
but no  there's still an exhaustion requirement.
but if  if you go out and, you know, give out dollar bills on the street till it's all gone  we accept that there are limits to our recovery.
the message is, "join the army." the 
yes. yes, your honor.
justice souter, one fundamental reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do, whether or not 
well, i think, you know, this  something this court has said repeatedly, that the deterrent function of damages is important  and here, we have  we have a very good  we have very good evidence that we need deterrents in this context. we need deterrents because constitutional violations have continued and continued. but i 
no.
ms.  ms. karlan says she doesn't know of any  of any ira that did place a  a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary ira wouldn't be within the exemption. do you know of any ira, a single ira that  that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?
well, your honor 
uh-huh.
well, i  i think in the ordinary instance, it would be reasonable for the team of executing officers to be responsible for the inquiry that i'm talking about and any individual officer 
well, certainly, your honor, they could have moved to amend their answer. we would have opposed it; and would, on remand, if the issue were to come up, on the ground that they had full information, and so that this is not an appropriate case to amend an answer. but i agree with you that that would have been one option, and that's the way that the third circuit analyzes this issue in the long case and in the bendolph case, using the principles of rule 15. the fifth  the eleventh circuit did not do that here. it said that there was an obligation for the court to impose the limitations defense; it did not apply the rule 15 
i think to me it's not 100 percent clear whether when taylor referred to the jury instructions and the charging documents, that that was exhaustive of the jury trial conflict.
that doesn't  that doesn't involve an interpretation of the treaty that is rendered by somebody else and that is binding upon this court. i mean, it's just a matter of different magnitude. to say that there can be private claims, fine; but that doesn't say that the interpretation of a treaty entered into the by the united states is subject to a court, other than this court.
it doesn't 
so you think the state trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol syndrome?
well, the  the difference for the person who is paying it under irp is that if only 20 percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate operating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the state, they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.
oh, no, no. i'm very 
that's not always true in a strickland case. it's often the court that's making the mistakes that the lawyer should have objected to and was incompetent in not doing so.
under rule 4?
thank you, ms. blatt. mr. connelly.
you're concerned about evaluating prison race policies. are there any other prison policies in the country that adopt a racial test like that?
i think the import of this argument is you should give the person the death penalty even if you're not sure he deserves it in order to further the deterrent function of the death penalty.
well, how is mail- 
but then why? why?
oh, a primary purpose? now, you're getting a little fuzzy there. i thought you said the primary purpose.
counsel 
but the question 
let me  let me take you back 19 to the  to the experts. you say he did not specifically 20 ask the experts to go  to go into his childhood 21 problems. you know, i can imagine when the expert comes 22 on the stand, the first question being asked is, now, mr. 23 expert, were you told by counsel to look into the 24 childhood problems? you know, as though counsel were 25 planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say. 1 what would anyone who hires a psychologist or a 2 psychiatrist  what would anyone expect him to look into 3 in  in determining whether the person is  is mentally 4 injured but  but the childhood? do you really think 5 counsel could not have expected with total assurance that 6 these people would do that?
and how soon is he entitled to appear before the magistrate?
yes.
over a dissent.
but here it's stipulated i thought.
well, you  you would make the same argument to that that  that you were making earlier, i assume, that to read it that way would  would be to nullify calderon.
on 
that's mentioned in what, 487(d)?
yes, because the government did not reach the government speech  or the court did not reach the government speech argument in united foods. and, in fact, united foods is back, on remand. that was a reversal of summary judgment for the government. it's back, on remand, and is being stayed, pending the outcome of this case on government speech. so there would not be an inconsistent result in 
but  but again, stay mindful. geraldine cannon, though, she said, i did not get admission to the  the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. so 
of course, that's not what the  what the warrant says. the warrant says i'm satisfied that the person or the property so described is now concealed on the premises.
you're asking us to say that not only do the states have to have the same rule, but they have to interpret the rule the same way. this would make the application of the categorical approach impossible. you'd have to look not only to the expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but to its application by the state courts in every jurisdiction. i mean, that just makes the whole enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.
no. our view is that it wouldn't be a citizen of a state simply by virtue of the fact that it has its principal place of business there. now, i would say, though, that it's not an open and shut case because the court in a case that specifically raised the issue, which of course this one doesn't, it could construe 1332(c), which is the provision that deals with corporations generally, as also applying to national banking associations insofar as national banking associations are, after all, corporations. but we think the better reading is that the specific governs the general, and therefore, that section 1348, which specifically deals with the question of national bank citizenship, would govern over the 1332(c) which more generally deals with the question of corporate citizenship.
yes, it was, your honor.
if it reproduces itself, justice kennedy, somewhere outside the united states 
well, i think in your situation  in the hypothetical you give, your honor, that would be somebody using just a regular transmission-only path to hear what the other person 
what about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death? i'm asking you the same question that i asked co-counsel. what happens then? he hasn't been able to come up with an alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he may be exposed to an excruciating death. what then?
you have to have 
i  i think that's true. whether it's an assumption of the argument, i'm not  i'm not so sure.
sir, all other factors, though, justice souter, as a person who stands in front of that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a specialized scroll is an indication that this was a monument that was dedicated and presented to the people and the youth of the state of texas by the fraternal order of eagles. there is no stamp of approval on this by the state of texas on that monument.
how did they applaud them?
i'd be happy to do that, justice o'connor. i think that there's been an exaggeration of how far it goes beyond. now, i want to be clear about one thing, which is this court, even before smith and o'lone, said that there was going to be deference to prison officials and a turner standard would apply. so to the extent that there's a little less deference here than under the o'lone standard, that is a modification. the centrality requirement, though, is not something that can be charged to rluipa or to rfra because even before the smith case, this court in ling and hernandez was moving away from centrality and 
i would like to 
that's the definition of an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain old money judgment.
so, you're concerned about conditions  i mean, as a practical matter, in terms of how the result in this case would change things, it's a question of whether ferc has to more or less accept what the state does, or whether ferc simply considers and decides whether it wants to impose those conditions.
thank you, counsel. mr. hallward-driemeier, you have 5-and-a-half minutes left.
 is that? is that a 
your honor, i don't believe so. i think our master would be just as cheap. (laughter.)
you could say the same thing when the state court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. in that case, you apply the kotteakos standard. i just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.
would it have been possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?
actually, your honor, i think the plain language of 760 makes it clear that the authors of the initiative intended to protect individual interests. there is no meaningful distinction between the use of individuals in 760, in section 760, than there is in the hudson, in the hudson statute, for example. the hudson statute, the illinois statute at issue in hudson, also required nonmembers to opt in in order to make, not just political contributions but any contributions. but the court, this court, found no problem with hudson or with the illinois statute in that case.
he can't complain in court or  well, it sounds as if you were saying that. you're saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent. isn't that your point?
well, how do we know 
i would be 
well, you haven't said anything then.
what about a claim that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the government, during trial?
before you move on, counsel 
we believe it is the latter. that we are assuming that harmless error analysis could apply here without conceding that it's necessarily applied, but assuming for the purposes of this case that it does apply, it should have applied the chapman standard, which is their standard for preserving 
mr. stewart, if you assume the apa is the remedy  we're talking about a district court procedure  how would you describe the final agency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?
i  i actually think it's a combination of two things. on the one hand, what the court actually said in its opinion was that the special master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to satisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.
so you would not pursue it?
i don't think it has. if  let me ask you this. if  if a decision says that what was a crime, as defined to the jury, is no longer a crime  the conduct was no longer a crime  i take it teague doesn't necessarily apply to that, but this is still a substantive rule that's retroactive. is that the way it works?
mr. stewart, your time is beginning to come up, and there is one thing we haven't talked about that i would really like to get your view on, and that is the 1788 treaty  what was that, fort schuyler  treaty of fort schuyler?
 because 
what would be left in the common-carrier category?
 an acquittal in your view is an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?
and you think it was clearly established that she had to allow a student at a school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner saying "bong hits 4 jesus"?
what you look at as, in seibert, is, was he 
they were saying they were an organ of 
oh, i'm sorry. to be clear, mr. chief justice, it was not held by the district court in this case to not apply. that issue was not in front of it. but at the time 
but you told the  you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate morse?
i think it was critical and of official course, you know, oregon is entitled to run its court system as it has for more than 30 years.
because we think it's important 
justice scalia, our objection to the seattle program is that it is not a race neutral means.
thank you, mr. ravenell.
but, counsel, i keep thinking of this example, and i want you to comment on it. out west, of course, there are a lot of dams where there are salmon in the  in the river, going down, and a lot of salmon get killed if they go through the  - through the dam, so that the water before the dam has live salmon, and the water after that has dead salmon. and say that happened in maine. would that be a discharge if that happened?
i think it would, and the state supreme court affirmed this decision.
and now suppose they waited 10 seconds. and so there would be a  a constitutional violation? why would suppression be appropriate in that situation? why would it be in any way proportional to the  to the violation that occurred?
thank you. mr. hungar.
would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you  taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?
it is an overt act that is beyond mere thinking about it.
does it  can  can you  can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is what i'm saying.
 then you're  then you're in the soup  (laughter.)
even if it were in 6 weeks, mr. chief justice, we believe that the process is  is sufficiently  that would just make the youth the same as the mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have stable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what this court said in atkins was we have two things to say. one is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the worst, and the very deficits that they have  that you called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, makes the jury  the process of the jury evaluating the moral culpability, the moral blameworthiness unreliable. and it's on the basis of those two things that we think that the consensus that's otherwise reflected is validated. and here 
mr. salmons.
i mean, there could be situations where there's a general code of conduct by all employees; you know, employees who feel that they've been, you know, harassed, sexually harassed, or feel that others are, should report that. but that may not be that person's assigned job duties. in other words, that person is not assigned to investigate and report those type of things.
yes. it  it has significance in a number of provisions. for example, it determines where the bank is located with respect to what interest rates it might charge under 12 u.s.c. 85, and that's an issue that this court confronted a few terms ago in the smiley case and also in the marquette case. but there are other provisions that refer to the  the location of a national banking association, and in all of those we think, as a starting point, the location would be the main office, and in some situations, it would also encompass branch locations. for purposes of this provision, we don't think that the location would encompass branch locations. and one reason, in particular, is because the subject that section 1348 deals with is the state citizenship of a national banking association. and the concept of citizenship has always been thought to require a distinctive association with a state and, in particular, has been thought to require something more than mere physical presence in a state. that's always been the rule with respect to national persons, and of particular significance, it's always been a rule with respect  it's always been the rule with respect to corporations. and congress defined national banking associations as, quote, a body corporate, close quote, in 12 u.s.c. 24.
so what does that mean? then that means you have like the family vendetta exception to the rico  (laughter.)
it says  mine says, you may command to search on or before april 27th for 10 days the person/place named and make the search in the daytime between 6:00 and 10:00. that's what mine says.
isn't that only summary for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was official proper?
but they would correct it if we told them to.
that certainly goes beyond where our precedent leaves off. that is, we are dealing with direct impositions by government in a way that poses an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.
no. if there was no probable cause.
but so far as  the rationale is the same.
of course, the reason they said it was plausible is that  and you may well be right, on the bottom line, and the government agrees with you, but there are  there's a redundancy in the statute. there's a phrase in there that could be taken out, and the statute would have exactly the same meaning, if you're correct.
no. it says  it says  we are disregarding the leas. that's the end of the process. but we have to identify the range of value that 5 percent and 95 percent applies to. the range  the percentiles apply to a range of values. we have in new mexico, we have 89 amounts of per-pupil revenue per district, we have 89 of those. but we also have 377,000 per-pupil revenues, because a per-pupil revenue repeats for every time that there's a student, and 
i think that would be a huge problem, because it would effectively constitutionalize the day-to-day interactions between supervisors and subordinates within the government, and put the federal courts in charge of overseeing that. even if these cases might ultimately be disposed of on summary judgment, there would be discovery, there would be the burdens of the litigation. and in a case like this, where the  where the government is taking the position that the  these actions were not even taken against the employee because of this disposition memorandum  they say they had perfectly valid other reasons  but this case exemplifies what the problem would be, is that the employee could identify something that he said or did in the course of his duties that involved speech and say, "that's the reason that i was disciplined."
 then how do you come out? because what they're saying is, "okay, balance. fine. you want to balance? here's how you balance."
so why can't i assume they will tell him so he'll know what's going on? and then if they don't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.
but  but, as with buying the bagels at a prayer breakfast, the cost of the bagels, like the cost of the security, is not  is not paying for the center of what the violation is. and therefore we think that that's the basis for a rule that rules those types of expenditures out.
it's not  the statement is not to the law enforcement officer, but he or she overhears it.
it's 
(inaudible)
the child is no longer a child, the child is an adult.
well, but it wouldn't undermine the security rationale just because you have some exceptions where there are other countervailing interests that might outweigh the security concern.
thank you, mr. gossett. thank you.
yes.
 that's not the question. the actually  actual entry was lawful, yes?
arkansas law, as you understand it 
probable cause that there  this is somebody who's going to use a certain telephone number and that there may be reason to suspect a crime will be discussed.
do you find 
i mean, we  we can call in these witnesses ourselves, i suppose, and hear them all again, but we usually accept the factual findings of the trier of fact.
there 
i don't know how you would sever a health exception that is not there. they're saying if something is in here, you can sever it and we'll be satisfied with what's left. in effect, if we were to enjoin certain applications, we would be injecting an exception that they've rejected. and whatever that may be, it does not seem to be severance.
anyway, it's a little drastic. i  i guess that before this happens, congress might enact a statute like the terrorist statute.
and they do.
i'm not sure you answered my question. did you not tell us that in the states where there  the largest volume of these hearings  in most of those states the burden is on the school board?
well, let's put it this way. so my understanding of your answer is that we could write an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other questions open? i don't see how we can do that.
this isn't over in the station. this is in the home. you speak of interests, but this doesn't interests. what about boyd? i mean, the most famous statement in fourth amendment history to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. it is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense. but it is the invasion of his indivisible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property. now, i thought  1886  that's what's governed these cases for about 100  and far more, a century and a half or a quarter. and  and the  then suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the one or the other one. i mean, doesn't that describe it?
why  it doesn't?
none  none at all, justice kennedy. i believe we provided the 
and after 
well, there  there are certain restrictions  certainly restrictions on what the prosecutor may do, but several points about that. first of all, this is not a bivens action against the prosecutor. the prosecutor is absolutely immune from suit. the prosecutor's decision-making process is  is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a  a critical protection against malicious prosecution 
well, they're  i'm sure that a label could be devised that would  that would be accurate. the  first of all, they are approved  specifically approved by the department of agriculture. the  certainly, the act and regulations provide that the secretary must approve every contract, every project for advertising. and, beyond that, the usda approves all advertising, all copy 
i understand, and i think you have $50 worth of damages right there. and our concern is what you have to prove 
all right. confine it to killing with intent.
thank you, mr. waxman. mr. utrecht, you have 4 minutes remaining.
mr. dreeben, is it  is this case materially different if she simply ran upstairs, grabbed the straw, brought it down, and handed it to the police officer? it's, in effect, the same thing, isn't it?
not completely, justice souter. but we do have a situation where only he broke free from one of the adults, not three of the adults. he was still under control in this situation. and he had gotten his hand free and smacked one of the other adults, the one who was the victim in this situation. so the officers  unlike some situations where they're called out and they wander on a situation, the officers in this case had personal knowledge of what was going on. they stood outside the home and watched the event transpire. and so they really need to wait and observe what's going to happen and wait till the last second before they need to go in. in this situation, there was nothing that would demonstrate in the facts that it was going to escalate at all.
so who, what, and where includes when, but it doesn't include how. right? where  where do you derive this proposition?
it was pretty clear. the  the words in question were: think about age. 17 years old. isn't that scary? doesn't that scare you? mitigating? quite the contrary i submit. quite the contrary.
say that again? you wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to find your problem. what's an example where you have a motivation distinguishing you from everybody else? i mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior art.
may i  if i can answer the first question first.
no, because those were lawful permanent residents whose  whose lawful permanent residency had  had  they came in under a grant of lawful permanent residency.
but if the defendant at the plea colloquy had said, yes, i entered x building or even in the plea bargain had said that, even though the charge just read the boiler plate, the whole statute, buildings, vessels, et cetera, if he had admitted it either in the plea colloquy or in the plea bargain, wouldn't that be enough?
well, this is an equitable rule in itself. because it allows something where an appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the circumstances, one, you were not notified, which obviously the court did. the other side's prejudiced 
justice alito, congress did not give the states unbounded authority. indeed, in section 401(d), there is a restriction. it restricts the conditions to those necessary to assure that the applicant will comply with conditions in our water quality standards. and if  i mean, ferc does incorporate those standards into the license, but the applicant can redress that in court, as this one has. so, we  i want to mention, again, that states care about hydropower. we care about fish migration. we care about recreation activities. we care about all of these things, and they're all incorporated into our water quality standards.
well, then, your honor, i guess the court would have to  to totally reconsider its decision in tyler v. cain to reach that conclusion. and i don't know what to say. i mean, since tyler v. cain was enacted for  i'm sorry  decided 4 years ago, congress has made no effort to overturn that decision, and it appears congress believed that the court had  had read the statute correctly in that case. and so if you interpret the made retroactivity  made retroactively applicable language in paragraph 6(3) in the way that this court read the language in paragraph 8(2), such that the retroactivity decision has to be made before a motion can be filed, it becomes very complicated to do that if the 1-year period begins to run within initial 
and whatever inference you might draw, it didn't prove out. so it seems to me the  the closest in time is the  and  and in fact is the episode he's just been through, the trial episode. so why wouldn't that be  the  the judge would start with that in mind. well, i tried this man and he didn't give me any problems, so i have no reason to anticipate problems now.
 that they can tune out.
justice breyer, in that context 
there are differences in my understanding, your honor, from state to state between the different blue cross entities. i couldn't tell you what exactly those differences are, but my understanding is that these blue cross policies vary from state to state. do they vary  i  i think, your honor, although it supports my contention, that you may have misunderstood what i said about the  the difference between the reimbursement clauses, honestly. what i  what i indicated was the  the reimbursement clause that is in the opm/blue cross contract is different from what blue cross then enters into with its members. that differs. i was not asserting that it differs from state to state. what i'm saying is that the effect of that differs from state to state certainly.
no. i  i think, a, it's not reasonable to assume that, your honor, and it's certainly not reasonable to assume it has the level of market power that jefferson parish required, which was significant market power. the court there held that a 30 percent share of the relevant market was not enough. so we're talking, in the tying context, of a very considerable market power test.
 which is what also happens here.
now, with respect to section 2, what is  what is your position on the relationship between the predominant political motivation and the existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?
no, justice alito, if i said that, i misspoke. i was trying to say that the record is not clear as to the frequency.
they're worried about having students driven off. and if you have jeering and picketing, do you really think that that fulfills the purposes of this amendment?
on the other hand, if it were a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around the public street where cars are parked around that known drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some contraband in the cars? is that okay?
well, to what extent was this argument raised below, i guess is a 
the "hang musladin" button, the impermissible factor first is the explicit message. "hang musladin." "convict him." it's urging the jury to convict him and that 
 of the case.
could you comment on that?
 and under  under state procedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot judgment. would that  would those facts suffice to allow them to enter without the knock?
well, why don't you take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get 
to wear any buttons? it says, "fair trial."
the  the only court i've heard of that can do that is the federal bankruptcy court.
but you're not going to treat that 
well 
well, it seems to me that those cases do not support your position, and i don't think it's correct to say that this is unsurprising, that the government makes a false representation about cases.
he said that it didn't fall within factor (k). however, the  the jury would  there is no reasonable likelihood and the california supreme court was not objectively unreasonable, including  in concluding that the  that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements and chosen to disregard payton's mitigating evidence because the jury just sat through eight witnesses testifying to payton's post-crime remorse and rehabilitation. they sat through that without any misstatements by the prosecutor. so they recognized that they had heard this evidence and that it was relevant and that it was subject to consideration. then they heard the arguments of counsel concerning the weight to be attributed to payton's mitigating evidence. and although the prosecutor did make the misstatements, his statements were relegated to that of an advocate. and to conclude that the jury would disregard the repeated instructions to follow the  to take the law from the court and their inevitable, long-held societal beliefs that remorse and rehabilitation are relevant to making an appropriate moral reasoned response in deciding the life or death sentence is not a reasonable conclusion. and we know that the fact  in fact, that the jury did consider payton's mitigating evidence by virtue of the questions that the juries  the jury asked the court during deliberations. the jury asked whether payton would be eligible for parole and whether any change in the law could retroactively make him eligible for parole. you only get to a consideration of whether  what the effect is of saving payton's life, under the california sentencing scheme that was  existed at that time, if you believe that there's mitigation evidence to consider because california, at the time of payton's sentencing, instructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose death. their 
all right, so i'm left with a record where i guess you have a subjective characterization that there is at least as much evidence in these cases supporting you and as much in congress supporting you as there was in the first stenberg case. but congress made this finding, so what am i to do with the finding?
well, as 
well, i think that it does for the reason that i said before, that that kind of consequence is a secondary effect of the prior unlawful employment practice, but under evans, which that kind of problem goes to 
it is certainly the case that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to innocent third parties, there would be a duty to discontinue the chase rather kill him. but you don't seem to buy that.
no, i agree.
but not with every state with which it has a close nexus.
are you relying, ms. blatt, at all on the difference between the pleading rules for civil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a whole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas rules?
well in theory perhaps they could be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of the accident, but in most states 
not necessarily. you could  you can use that broadband service to go to other information providers.
that's a question on which we didn't grant cert.
and there is  in fact, there's no immunity. that's what makes this different. suppose the bivens action had been brought first. the officers would not have been immune from suit. it's not like an officer who has qualified immunity and doesn't depend upon the suit order. here, there would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued the officers directly and not brought that federal tort claims act suit first.
no, it's not. the statute  the only exceptions in the statute are for guidelines departures 
with regard to the 5,000 acres that they occupied as of 1838, one could read ransom gillett's assurances to the oneidas as allowing them to continue to retain occupancy over that narrow slice of land, but what that cannot do is change the language of the treaty which makes clear that the reservation is otherwise entirely disestablished. and if i can refer to some of the language of the treaty itself, first of all, the treaty explicitly states that its purpose was to carry out the government's policy in removing the indians from the east to the west of the mississippi. that simply cannot be squared with ongoing sovereignty over the remaining 295,000 acres which they now claim 
well, what we're reviewing is a ruling, not a question. you certify a ruling. now, it's usually set out for the court of appeals so they know what the question is.
justice breyer's example is one specifically related to commingling. commingling itself does not, in fact, bar 
no, with all due respect, your honor, that was not my answer. my answer is that  and i will tell your honor that i will not change that position  it should never be allowed to be cured.
well, mr. srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by ihs and the tribes did somehow contract away federal  inherent federal functions?
 is going to have rather a drastic effect on 
so 
it is certainly greater, but part of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers for the  the juveniles, those under 18, that the difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how the numbers come out. but if you look over the last 10 years, in fact, it has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend, but the down trend 
respondent places 
well  well, as you mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a  what struck me anyway as a very interesting provision in there. it covers wetlands adjacent to waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands. now, everything that you've said today and in your brief would lead me to think you would contend that wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them out. and i want to know why do you think the regulation leaves those wetlands out.
general clement, before you go there, i want to question you about your distinction between dr. kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled substances. why could not the attorney general treat dr. kevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the public health and safety, and seek his  cancellation of his license?
well, i  i take it underlying justice ginsburg's question is  is the concern that this accommodation is unequal because there are other first amendment rights that are not given the  that are not given the same precedence.
yes.
what do i do here? because the sentence i read to you seems to say the opposite. but then, two sentences on, they list, the federal judge is not bound by the guidelines, he must consult the guidelines. and after they say, an aggravating california  it says the discretion available  the  in california law, that may include any fact that the judge reasonably determines to be relevant. the determinate sentencing law, about an upper term, is comparable to booker's requirement that a federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable. well, i assumed until this minute that the first statement trumped the second. but now when i see the court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the second statement, you could read the second statement as saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment that i'm giving a higher one. to be honest, i don't know what black means.
that in order to address the ninth circuit's holding 
what cases require overruling?
the discretion 
well, unless they were saying those activities were, in fact, principal activities. if it's integral, if it's embraced by the principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it in two categories rather than inventing a third.
yes, but i mean that's 
is the test proposed by the petitioner that  that you have to prove non-duress by beyond a reasonable doubt?
yes. i mean, he's got to qualify under the federal standard. he says, the offense i was charged with was killing with or without intent, plus crime. i want an instruction that says nothing about plus crime but simply charges on killing with or without intent. isn't he asking under federal law for a lesser-included instruction?
 the rule  the rule 183 does provide for a certain degree of deference to be given to those findings of the special trial judge.
mr. dreeben.
are there states in which wachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries comparable to this?
the  i mean 
 will ordinarily be available for a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme established by the csra 
 the same city 
it doesn't do anything for you. [laughter.]
 i 
yes. but that was while he was being chased, right? before being chased he hadn't done any of this. he was going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.
these  you'd think that if there was that type of disruption and hindrance of the way public agencies were carrying out their missions by these kinds of cases, which have been around for a long time, that you'd see citations to them in the petitioner's brief, in the united states brief. and their silence on this point is both deafening and telling, because, in fact, it has not been the problem that is being posited here, and this is not a new approach that we're talking about. but getting back to the givhan case, conferences between teachers and principals are a part of the teacher's job, and it's pure formalism to make the protected status of the givhan teacher's speech turn on whether the employee manual says a teacher has to work to root out race discrimination. or what if she was a part-time ombudsman who is charged to improve race relations in the school? under their approach, you know, boom, it's not protected speech anymore, even though the underlying first amendment value is exactly the same. it also makes it completely subject to manipulation by the employer in making everything a part of an employer  employee's job, in terms of reporting duties, which 
that's correct, your honor. it would basically be 
 they're not saying only 
but the penry error, even if not structural, is not subject to harmless error review and you could say that that distinction is possible because penry has a built-in harmless error or a harmful error component. but as i understand it that's not  that issue is not in this case.
i say, i cannot imagine that. no.
well, the second part of it is, what punishment means is what would be done in a class action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the harm suffered by oregon smokers.
i presume, justice breyer, you mean at the time that congress enacted iirira?
that's correct. and no. there  we have not found any cases where the court has heretofore read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision. but this statute is unique. the money laundering statute is unique. if you look at the statute and we lay it out  the statute in total  in our reply brief, starting at 1a  the structure of 1956 strongly supports our position that all congress was doing, when they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money laundering conspiracies. as this court is well aware, when congress typically writes a complex statute, the statute begins by setting forth all of the offense elements. here, that would be set forth in (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). the statute then goes on in subsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions. subsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the act. subsection (d) then talks about relationships with other laws. subsection (e) identifies those federal agencies that can investigate money laundering offenses. subsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there would be extraterritorial jurisdiction. subsection (g) then talks about recording  reporting requirements, and then you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you read the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be increased to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense provision.
would you advise a client that way? would you advise a client that way?
preventing a contrary viewpoint from being expressed, that we 
well, you're urging then that the ninth circuit be affirmed on alternate grounds.
you can't have it both ways, counsel. i mean, you're really losing me here. either it is our supervisory power and therefore the states don't have to follow it, or it is more than our supervisory power and the states do have to follow it. i don't know that there's any way to straddle that.
do you accept that?
 in a school.
that is correct, justice ginsburg, except that the record does show that, during the time that the iep was being developed, the parents applied for the child to attend a private school and actually accepted an application fee and enrolled the child in that school, and the alj in this case found that the parents had made a predetermined decision to send the student to child  the student 
could  could you use the same rule with respect to alibi evidence? the trial judge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so strong, i'm not going to let any alibi evidence in. is there  is there anything special about third party guilt? couldn't  couldn't you use  use it for other defenses?
well, can the president give an interpretation of the treaty unilaterally that is binding on us? can the president sign a treaty and then, a year later, give an interpretation of that treaty that's binding on us, insofar as what the treaty means?
the court  or the state challenged 12 of the claims as unexhausted. the district court found eight of those claims to be unexhausted, your honor, and made that finding after mr. rhines' 1-year aedpa period had run. the finding  mr. rhines had filed in february of 2000 pro se. the district court's conclusion that he had a mixed petition and that there were eight unexhausted claims was made in july of 2002.
which is what she did.
that's right, justice o'connor.
thank you, mr. rosenkranz. the case is submitted.
so  so the  the implication, i  i guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not.
right.
that's correct, that they not only have to have applied the appropriate standards  that is, the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, which is the same as california's "reasonable possibility" standard  they not only have cried  applied the correct standard, but they have to have done so in a principled and complete way so the reviewing court can make sure that they've actually cured the error.
in your view  in your  your opinion, if you were to follow that, would epa  suppose epa does the following. epa looks into this and they publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think that state tort suits will interfere with our ability to promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're preempted. can the epa do that on your theory?
but that you did not need diversity between the defendant and the third party defendant.
 first amendment speech.
no, but in our construction of the statute, we have to think about its application throughout the united states, not just in north  north carolina.
that's right.
your honor, what we believe is that what congress did in enacting the controlled substances act was leave those decisions to the states to enforce according to their traditional methods. now, in some cases, that may be by statute; in some cases, the states may discipline doctors for  through a state medical board.
my hypothetical that i started with was assuming you have a state law claim, a state law cause of action. so do you have any authority other than grable for the proposition that a state law cause of action which  in which the law to apply may or may not turn on federal law in particular aspects presents a federal question?
that's my understanding of the law.
is that possible?
 that it's whether or not oregon law also requires it. and we believe, under oregon law, we're entitled to put this on, we're entitled to rebut this. for example, justice kennedy was talking about a scenario  and, in this very case, the joint appendix, at page 92, the prosecutor in this case  this is an excerpt from the trial  was trying to get in evidence that the defendant was being manipulative. and, at this point, the alibi evidence had been excluded. and so, the fact that the defendant was not taking responsibility, perhaps was being deemed as manipulating people by trying to get them to come forward to say, "i wasn't there," then alibi is relevant to respond  to rebut and respond to that kind of an argument.
it's a claim upon which the immunity depends. the immunity is claimed  the immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he was not acting outside the scope of his employment. the reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he didn't do what they say he did.
i'm not sure that justice stevens is suggesting that as a standard. he's suggesting it as a disqualifier. if it's not as compact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's  i  i don't think he's suggesting it's okay. so we still don't have a standard.
well, under california's law, they have  in addition to factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider unenumerated factors.
that is correct. that is the 
thank you. that would be an entirely different case than the one we have here, justice souter. the 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system  and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that the fcc regulations entitle us to  was calculated  in fact, the d.c. circuit made the fcc go through this exercise three times to get it right. so to calculate that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.
i don't understand your point about the state court focusing on norris. the question under aedpa is still whether or not it is an unreasonable application of supreme court law.
the england case 
the nonintercourse act in effect at the time prohibited the purchase made  prohibited the purchase of lands from indians or indian tribes, to paraphrase. and that would have, and what hasn't 
and you 
 22- 
an example would be anytime a tax preparer makes a mistake of federal income tax law in  in preparing a return for a client and, as a result of that, the client pays more tax than they otherwise should have and they have a claim against the tax preparer either for common law negligence or professional malpractice under state law, but why did the  the preparer commit malpractice? because of an interpretation of federal tax law.
 for any purpose other than 
well, because he's  he's given it away. in that sense i think  and  and in answering this, if i may just go back to one point that justice souter made and that is that i don't think it's the case that our analysis turns at all on how you value the claim, either at the time of the fee agreement or afterwards. our analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of whether the value changed or not, the client was at all times in control of the underlying source of income, and it's just as if in helvering v. horst the father assigns the  the bond coupon to his son, but he controls the underlying source of income.
i thought the court said that 
well, there is certainly a credibility issue as to whether scott says he knew or didn't know. i mean, certainly the call on the radio he could have acquired. the thing is that 
either means sometimes presents a potential risk of physical injury, then official obviously they're all covered. or if it says characteristically presents the risk, potential risk, then do you have to decide whether that, it is a characteristic of potential burglary that it  that it does present this risk or that just once in a while it does.
it wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all. the statute just says the information on which his allegations are based. they don't say the allegations that eventually give rise to a recovery.
 before he'll get relief.
so, the question is, how  you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case? and i find it pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the government in these cases.
what about california, which was the state where this episode occurred? was  - i think you mentioned that he did not make a claim under the state statute.
if he does it within 10 days under rule 
what you're saying is it would  i thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the  the statutory provisions would be an implied term. isn't that it?
but your test is whether or not there's reliable record evidence? is that  that the test?
how  how often does this happen? in other words, are we being asked to, in effect, on your part to  to recognize or to derive a special rule for cases which, at least numerically, are sports?
your honor, there are a number of limits clear in the controlled substances act. but taking the hypothetical you've offered, specifically, we think that the answer would have to be that congress intended to leave the definition of what is a legitimate medical practice to the states.
over every claim  every claim in the class.
what about in good faith and with substantial support in sound medicine.
but that wasn't the sec's position below, was it?
thank you. mr. waxman.
well, that's not true. maybe the  maybe the person decides he won't accept it.
well, the  the limitation not only excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business regulatory offense.
well, we think the relief that we're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be remanded for the district court to resolve these issues under preclusion doctrines.
you said  you said that something has started in the texas courts. we have the motion to stay this case, and your response that it shouldn't be stayed, that we should decide this case. but what is going on, at this moment, in the texas courts?
do you not agree that it has no chance of survival, in most cases?
does the gravamen 
that, that's true, your honor, but i still think you have to look at the basis that they've relied upon on standing. and they haven't shown specific facts which should provide any comfort to this court that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer greenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on their alleged injuries.
well, i don't see it at  at issue in this case, your honor.
 of what actually happened.
however, nothing in the following instruction says you shall not consider payton's mitigating evidence.
mr. staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or i think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in god we trust, like god save the united states and this honorable court, like under god, and a document that is about worshipping the lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic. so it's not a brief reference. it's a powerful statement of the covenants that the lord is making with his people.
the federal circuit is borrowing tenth circuit's law for this purpose, but the tenth circuit's law, as i understand it, has  is the position that was just presented to us by mr. stewart. that is, if you don't make what used to be called the jnov, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't raise the sufficiency on appeal.
yes. that was what i was going  aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the ira's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?
it seems to me that you then have a suit under fifra, but i don't think that was the theory of your complaint.
what was the 
well, we've also said that mere protectionism is permitted.
 the substantial interest?
it can be a more serious problem in capital litigation, where you're dealing with many more claims, which could be more complex, which could require exhaustion for the  before the federal review. it just depends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the issues involved. i think that the statistics that were cited in the justice department study have different dates for how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the claim, whether it be for prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance, and so forth.
but doesn't congress have to create causes of action for constitutional violations as well, or at least for most of them?
so, if it were established in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in a significant degree because of its oxygen component, that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?
because it's a mixed question of law and fact 
the same thing would happen to a white. it's not because he's black. i mean, this  right? the same thing would happen to a white.
none of that is included, even from the plant gate to the place where you don and doff.
is that part of what's going on?
it would be a strikingly odd result, though, for this court to reach that, given that congress has clearly provided for appellate review of remand orders in other contexts, including in the class action fairness act, under tribal property disputes, the fdic, the rtc, and specifically in 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. so congress knows how to do this if that's what congress had intended.
you could not?
and they didn't even look at 15 that file?
well it has to be a reasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in frazier.
but  but i guess my only point is that (4) does not say any period during which the defendant is mentally incompetent. it says any period of delay resulting from the fact that he was mentally incompetent, and this did not result from that fact until at the end of the period the judge says, oh, i find him incompetent, so that any period after that would be the result of the fact that he was incompetent. but the  the delay up to that point was attributable solely to the judge's failure to make a determination.
your honor, the  that was not the prosecutor's argument at trial and it's  it is not our position now that 
so that the only thing  your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this court, and that if you don't have a case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then that's the end of it?
i was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer. he comes back and says, well, very often states do control the water.
i think it would be an easy choice.
why?
right.
what does "negligent transmission" add to "loss" or "miscarriage"?
yes, your honor.
is there any other relief sought by the petitioner? there was the suppression request. was there any other? was there a request of the kind that the icj thought would be appropriate, which was, court, reconsider this and determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of vienna convention notice?
i think the state has to stay within the constitutional confines of the shaw v. reno doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a district  has to  has to create a minority opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise violate shaw. now 
fine. now suppose we take a set, which you think exists as not the null set, of instances where there is no such transfer, which your opponents say is this case. now what's the justification for regulating those? if it's simply flood control because water flows over the top and sits there, i guess you could say the same thing is true of any low depression, and therefore, the presence of water would be just a coincidence. now, what's your  the fact that they're wet doesn't have anything to do with it. it's the fact that they're next to a place that floods that has to do with it. now, what's wrong with what i just said?
there  there's nothing in the record that supports any of that.
now mr. waxman, we've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to the merits. so we'll give you a couple of minutes for rebuttal. why don't you answer that.
yes.
it does not apply.
is there a difference between you and merck concerning the scope and extent of the common law research exemption? and if there is, does that even enter into our case?
the source is the generic definition as applied in all of the states.
all right. now, let's suppose you're 
well, isn't  isn't there a big difference between sitting on a seat and running a forklift and  and picking up steel rails with your bare hands?
but even if it was unlawful, it was not unconstitutional.
yeah. you're saying there is no bivens action, period.
well, it doesn't read like an affirmative defense, your honor. it doesn't say "affirmative defense." it simply  and in  when it was introduced, it was listed in the legislation as a rule of construction. and i think that's exactly how it reads. it doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on andersen, or on nancy temple. and, your honor, i think, actually 
i think it's clearly enough simply to say that, as i indicated, even if it had just been an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has instructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that that would be enough.
well, if i can just stop you there. your  your friend on the other side cites the many common law cases not allowing subrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does allow it, subject to the make-whole doctrine.
very well, mr. donovan. mr. cruz, we'll hear from you.
 can you read it this way? i  i think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?
you  you are suggesting an extraordinary setup with a state court being able to preclude other courts from dealing with related, not identical matters, and that's just not the way our system works. you can bring duplicative proceedings in different courts. one will finish first and that will bind the others. but i  i never heard of a state court being able to say, because we are a probate court, that you  you couldn't bring a tort case someplace else.
well, let me  let's  let's go back and  because justice o'connor started me off, and i  i don't want to fail to get to her question. the first statute was the 1882 statute. the 1882 statute unambiguously stated that the jurisdiction shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the united states. so the  the purpose of congress was to  to give national banks access to diversity jurisdiction on the same basis as state banks. and that  in the leather manufacturers bank case, that was recognized by the court. then in 1887, congress went to a different wording totally. it injected the word location. and i  i should point out that the 1882 statute was in the bank act and the 1887 statute was in the judiciary act. so it was  it's not clear what they thought they were doing with the 1882 statute when they adopted the 1887 statute. but it is clear what this court said they were doing in the petri case. this court said no reason is perceived why it should be held that congress intended that national banks should not resort to federal tribunals as other corporations and individual citizens might. it then said further on, on page 651 of 142 u.s., the clause was intended to have and must receive the same effect and operation as that of the proviso to the fourth section of the act of july 12, 1882. and finally, they close by saying, no limitation in the regard of access to federal diversity jurisdiction was intended. then we have the 1911 codification, and in  and after 1911, we have several supreme court cases, including the mitchell case, which again says that the codification worked no change. it says, the court held that as to suits with  within the specified exceptions, national banks were, by the acts of 1882 and 1887, put on the same basis in respect of jurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an act of congress. and then in 1948, you have the reenactment or the codification of the current judicial code, not intended to work any change in the meaning of the statute.
why can't it make an adjustment in this case?
the phrase justice harlan used in the davis case.
i don't see the distinction as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.
doesn't the latter suggest that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?
but what i'm saying is 
and you  and you're perfectly free to do that if you don't take the money.
but it  it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable. it says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. it's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions 
so, it doesn't go at all to the items that are the target of the warrant.
well, that may be, but how about the question that i posed? (laughter.)
 congress did change it, in the 1988 act, but it did it  and this is significant  it did it in connection with two changes in the immigration law. one is the enactment of the definition of "aggravated felony," which, as i have explained, the definition of "aggravated felony" looks to state law, in a number of respects, in terms of the severity of the offense or the punishment actually imposed. that was one change. the other change that was made in the 1988 act was to amend section 1326 with respect to illegal reentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony, and an aggravated felony. and certainly the conviction of any felony includes state law offenses in this  official
as we point out in our brief, your honor, we do believe that since the amendment in 1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion 
in fact, that's what happened to these people. so i just don't see how your argument is going to 
 and if it's  but that's this unnamed defendant's particular problem.
 principal activity?
 in your own behalf.
because the rule of accrual is that the act  the claim accrues when the plaintiff experiences an injury.
well, how do you  how do you have an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate? in other words, the federal government is saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your immunity. and the state's saying, "you don't have that authority." and how do you get an informed waiver, simply because the state participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on the basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today, that congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the immunity?
the breard case simply made reference to  that there was, arguably, individual rights. it didn't purport to resolve that. it said, even if there were, it is barred by aedpa. so i don't believe the breard case answers it, one way or the other; but, given the united states' consistent position  and, indeed, it uses very similar language in later treaties, such as the two terrorism treaties that are cited in the united states' brief. it is worth underscoring that on every question currently before this court in this proceeding, the united states agrees entirely with texas, that this court's resolution of this case should be to affirm the judgement of the fifth circuit because a coa should not have issued.
 and that, your honor, is not correct. what they have done is conflate two concepts, the incidence of the tax 
 but rfra also requires that the government prove, if it proves a compelling interest, to enforce it against the person, and if it gets there, it also must prove that it is furthering that compelling interest by the least restrictive means. now 
 embodies knowledge.
not for all 
i think 
 were talking about 
 have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the fda?
 what i would say 
and that determination of what was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the trial judge, rather than to the court of appeals. it would be 
but he couldn't get a warrant saying that.
i think he could say that.
 the triggering event has a probable cause implication, which the selection of objects to be seized does not have.
in that situation. recognizing that's not the situation we have here 
yes, that's right. and this is a reconstruction, because i have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant commerce clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine 
the sg's reply brief, i apologize. the gray brief. where they seek to get some support for the idea that modification was dropped out of this analysis. but the truth is, that was a proposed rule that would have done exactly what they say that the 1980 rule did without adopting that particular regulation.
presumably. there is nothing in the record that suggests what happened to it. whether it was repealed or not. but it was specific factually only to that second display, not to the foundations display which the district court found was fundamentally different. and if there is any doubt regarding the history of purpose, we would suggest, justice o'connor, your suggestion in the wallace, that if there is any doubt regarding purpose, to look to the effects prong. and i think when you look to the effects prong, a reasonable observer will see that this is a constitutional display. this case is one in which the sixth circuit drew the most difficult hate, it imposed it in a subsequent action in the most difficult area of the establishment clause and clearly the public officials have substantially and fundamentally changed. they can't live under this taint forever. they tried but they could to correct their way. they tried what they could to display this in a constitutional manner so that anyone passing by would see this as one document among many others. in addition to the display itself, with all the other hundreds of documents that are on the wall, this display has a specific stated purpose.
so why didn't congress just add the provision making this very clear that the senate had passed, why did the house boot it out of the conference bill?
you tell me something is in the chair. did they stuff it  stuff it in the cushion or what?
 to wit, a handgun. and then the special verdict form doesn't say one word about firearm. so couldn't the defendant expect, well, they charged the main thing? they charged me with deadly weapon, and they asked the jury to find deadly weapon.
more common, or didn't exist at all before the 19-  do you know of any case before 
the record shows that of 5 weeks of voir dire, the state requested shuffles three times. two of those times, the defense counsel put on the record that there were a greater number of african american jurors in the front of the panel. they 
in order to agree with you on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide two disputed issues of california law? whether accessory here in this statute means accessory after the fact, and whether if somebody is charged under that statute as an accessory, that has to be alleged specifically in the indictment, or whether it is just sufficient to charge the person with the offense.
but congress made, established an absolute immunity where the employee was acting within the scope of employment, and petitioner agrees that scope of employment is the essential question for immunity. so if in my hypothetical the supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by the westfall act from a claim arising out of the context of that employment.
i also  it's very efficient to allow people to communicate, in english.
all right. well, suppose what they do is  this is  it seems to me this case is like a first-year law school hypothetical. but, i mean, the  suppose that the  what they do is, he puts the mail on the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently; and there for everyone to see is the toupee that i ordered. [laughter.]
why is that, counsel? let's suppose that the  one of the cases that come up is a language difficulty. the individual  maybe he's not in uniform  identifies himself as a police officer. could the state have a rule that, "we are not going to allow evidence of language concerns," that the individual didn't speak english, and the officer said, "i'm a police officer," so he didn't know, when he shot him? what is it about mental capacity that allows you to exclude that type of evidence?
and i 
yes.
what, what does necessarily mean? does it mean no additional evidence? does it mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to support a conviction? does it mean no additional evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of fact?
what can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the act? what can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child?
right. this is just a union.
and what about under rule 19?
but  but providing for workers' compensation through insurance, rather than through self-insurance, is also not on the list.
copyright. copyright. you normally copyright.
 wouldn't do any harm.
it does  for purposes of this court's government speech doctrine, it does. and i think 
but snyder was a class action case that says you cannot aggregate claims under 1332. and so what snyder says is because  because the class action fairness act is restricted to diversity cases or diversity type cases, what it says is that  and, therefore, is an amendment to 1332. what it does is add a new section to create original jurisdiction in diversity cases involving class claims. and incidentally, the significance of that in this case is  justice o'connor, you said is it retroactive. the answer is yes and no. it's applicable to all cases filed after its effective date, which is already effective as of a couple weeks ago. if exxon gets dismissal of this claim and gets it refiled, we will be applicable to the class action fairness act and be right back in federal court where we started. and so what you're left with is all they're really looking for here now is a new trial, and this is just a procedural game to come back. but there's very  one important point i want to make to you. you said in finley we're going to not make  do this with jurisdiction anymore. we're going to ask congress to do it. and congress did it. and so you read 1367 and, respectfully, it is clear. every court that read it at a certain point said it was clear, and the only ambiguity is created by a house report that says, notwithstanding what it says, we meant something else. that's  the ambiguity is not created by the statute, but by an 
mr. bolick, you have, let's see, about four minutes left.
 in order to consider the facts.
no, that is one of the factors in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full of examples of that. i would like to make one other response to justice scalia's point, if i could. justice scalia, to the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used fairly determination, as petitioner in the district court would have it. we discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example, the restatement's position, which we would urge the court to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.
but that illustrates the very 
well, the  it's assault in the second degree which requires  itself requires use of a deadly weapon. so it wouldn't even be assault in the second degree under washington law without the jury finding a deadly weapon.
that was not an interpretation that ousted this court of jurisdiction over the matter, though, was it?
that is certainly true, although i would take issue with the notion of there being a colorable claim. i don't think that the slusa removal is analogous to the federal officer removal statute where the statute itself says the defense has to be under color of law, and this court in the mesa v. california case said that phrase is where the colorable claim creates article iii jurisdiction.
if they're turned in earlier, will they  will they be ruled on earlier?
it's the supreme court of ohio that then i think i got my impression from, and of course, they don't know either.
my response, your honor, is that, first of all, a 14-foot banner.
in florida, or in the eleventh circuit, they have determined that conspiracy to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious potential risk.
well, there was  there was a timeframe of  there was evidence that they  the codefendants testified that the  the three of them planned to do another burglary of a different house, and then  the codefendants' timeframes are rather fuzzy, but then they went back, at some point, to the defendant's father  house to obtain weapons, and then went on to the ultimate victim's house. so, to the extent that this deliberation includes events that occurred before the actual homicide, it's relevant to this deliberation question. and, additionally, the 
they knew that minors were in the backyard. they  they witnessed the two juveniles. they did not know that 
 of the hobbs act.
but is that your position?
i think he 
are you going to say that if  if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed to be correct?
justice breyer has not heard these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know whether  whether, for example, these  this testimony about the confession was credible or not.
but they paid  they paid whether it was a market price or not. i mean 
was that as a reason for there not being error? or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice. what does the footnote mean, in your opinion? the second?
 that these people 
i don't believe it does, your honor. i believe that what whren teaches is that the subjective working of the police officer's mind, his motives, his intentions, his legal assessments, as in other cases, his legal assessment with respect to the extent of a consent to search, or the reason he's boarding a boat, is irrelevant, that that's for courts to do. what matters is what came into an officer's brain, not what came out as a result of his working on it. because, as i said, that would make law enforcement far from unevenhanded. it would make it depend upon who the officer was at the roadside on any given night. and those similarly situated would be treated very, very differently, depending upon what an officer chose to say. and as i said, silence in a  in a jurisdiction that's governed by the closely related offense doctrine is the best course.
do you 
i think the answer to that is that statutes of limitations are ubiquitous in civil proceedings. but just as ubiquitous is rule 15(c) relation back. they go hand in glove. and congress, in 1948, just three years after the tiller case, when it enacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back goes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation; and, not only that, but how relation back has been construed by the courts. so i don't think it's any surprise to congress now all of you  now all of a sudden that we say, "oh, you know, by the way, there's this relation back that's going to give us maybe four or five months longer than the year." i don't think congress is at all surprised by that. and congress just adopted new rules of habeas proceedings, in 2004; didn't amend rule 15(c), didn't provide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242. and, as far as the potentials for abuse here, the seventh circuit's  judge easterbrook's decision for the seventh circuit in the ellzey case has been on the  on the books for more than two years now. and i would suggest that if the parade of horribles that the warden has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we seek here, that the warden or the united states would have come to this court and said, "look, here are the abuses. they are happening right now." well, in fact, ellzey's been cited twice in all  in these years, by the district court, to allow relation back. mr. felix's case has not been cited at all in a published case. so, i think that the parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical. as justice kennedy pointed out, you have rule 15(a) as a backstop. and once the answer is filed, that really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter of right. then 
i thought the seventh circuit said in  quickly in passing that the damages would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful arrest until the time of arraignment. that would, that would be the  be all of your damages. if there wasn't an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to the seizure.
no, justice kennedy, there were not.
you mean 
and you have some of those.
no, but in  this is a  an  a case in which the insufficiency of the evidence was extremely apparent. these parties 
but the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is official nonetheless governed by 1447(d). there are a lot of erroneous remands and this would just be, just be another one.
actual inducement?
but why not?
yes, but it seems that if he doesn't do that, then that's a bar. but if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?
in 
why would you have to apply that? it's a federal question whether the claim is pending or not during that whole period, right?
and in terms of the fcc calling this unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that the only reason the fcc has ever given that this is unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its regulations. and if there's one thing we know from the official structure of the communications act, it's that for something to be remedial in federal court, in other words  and if we know something violates 201, it is remediable.
i don't think the mandamus solution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you say you lose  you lose the claim unless you bring mandamus.
because at that point, i knew that they had total discretion. i knew that before they had changed their protocols when the electric chair litigation was going on. indeed, the florida legislature changed the entire statute when this court accepted mr. bryant's case 
well, this court has never addressed  and, in fact, there is disagreement here as to whether it can be cured. so, here, the trial court did look  the trial court really didn't look at the analysis in how you look at whether 
i know that hurts your case, but i  i still need to think of some argument or reason why the judge shouldn't have to at least make a finding.
that's right.
that's how she read what happened.
all right. what is it, ten dollars a gallon, or what?
(2) "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities." you're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the text itself joins them. the activities referred to in (2) are "said principal activity or activities." the "said" refers to the ones that are in (1).
well, you're not  you're generally not supposed to be waiting. i mean, you were talking about claims such as 
well, but that's  and if i could just say, it's no different than steffel against thompson. there is a case where there is a challenge against a broad criminal trespass statute. the theory in steffel was not that the whole criminal trespass statute was unconstitutional. it was it's unconstitutional if you apply it to leafletting. and justice brennan for a unanimous court said, yes, that's exactly the kind of challenge you can bring. and you can get declaratory judgment that says you can't do that, you can't apply the statute as to leafletting. but you don't strike down the entirety of the criminal trespassing statute.
i guess striking a big person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.
the overlap may not have been perfect, at least, among other things, in the sense that some courts were still under the misimpression that there was a subjective element to rule 11, as well. so, the solicitor general is correct in saying that there is that logically possible reason for the enactment of the statute, in that there is not a perfect overlay. we submit that, in light of the other available textual indicia and the policy reasons, that logically possible hypothesis is not the most reasonable hypothesis. we have 
well, what's wrong with giving him the opportunity to say why he's not a gang leader?
well 
that is a correct statement of the law. so then, i take it, the other thinks that it isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs, you do some experiments and you get some information that would be useful to the fda and the ind process, and, therefore, they are within the safe harbor.
yes, your honor.
absolutely, your honor.
well, i don't think he'd be in the middle of trial under heck against humphrey.
was to reduce the volume of litigation, period?
i agree with you. and my point is, i am including instances not just in which "pollutant" is used. a whole variety. and, in every single one of those, its common  and i would submit that the word itself, when you use the word "into," naturally suggests  in fact, why would someone use the phrase "discharge into the navigable waters" if what they really meant was, "if you do anything to the navigable waters at all, you've got to get a permit"?
i would say, your honor, that the state application may be the subject matter of what you are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but what the court is ruling on is the petition for certiorari, which was a federal court ruling on 
because that was a candidacy right, what the candidate was going to do, and in that particular case, this court noted that the candidate of the democratic-farmer-labor party had a choice. that candidate could have chosen to be the candidate of the new party or that he could stay, as he did, with the democratic-farmer-labor party. we don't have the choice here. they wanted to have him be the candidate of both parties at the same time. we recognize that the state may properly limit each voter to a single nominating act, to a single vote, and we're not asking that. we're not asking that the state not be allowed to set reasonable times to let them know about what we're going to do. but in timmons  and i think timmons is what led the district court astray here was what was not recognized was that there was a choice allowed in timmons, and there's not a choice here. if  if this had been in oklahoma, in  in that regard, there would have been no way for  there's no way for a voter who's in the republican or democratic parties who wants to vote in the libertarian party because of the unreasonable deadlines to change and because of the lack of opportunity, there's no way that they can register. so they don't have the choice to register as a libertarian, as the candidate of the democratic-farmer-labor party did in timmons, to change if he wanted to. he chose to stay in the major party. but that is one significant difference with timmons. and also, of course, i couldn't  i would also want to mention that minnesota is a state that has no political party registration. so once again, the problem and issues we're confronted with here could not occur in minnesota. but i think that's significant. and there was  there was nothing on any voter that would have kept them from being able to vote for that particular candidate in the general election. they were going to be  he was going to be on the ballot in the general election. in this case, the voters that don't have the choice that that candidate did in timmons, they are not going to be able to express their opinion on a party that they would like to express an opinion in  in their primary. and i think that is a very important distinction. i think that oftentimes in the standard that the court uses, that there is a difference, sometimes depending on which particular judge writes the decision on how a standard is explained. but in this case, it is, as the tenth circuit said and as the district court recognized, something that lies between this court's decision in tashjian and this court's decision in california democratic party v. jones. but in both those cases, the court recognized and called for exacting scrutiny when a law was impacting a party's choice as to how it wishes to choose its nominees. i do not think that the rationale come up by the state, this thing about draining, taking  keeping the disloyal voters in the republican and democratic party and not letting them come over, whether they wouldn't have voted at all, or whether they didn't have the chance to register as libertarians, or whether they simply are inspired by the particular candidates, i don't think in that situation that that is either a compelling interest by the state and i certainly don't think it is rational. and in fact, as far as being paternalistic, i think the state is totally wrong there because i think this would actually benefit the major parties. but i am saying to you that this is limited, under the tenth circuit's decision, to the facts in oklahoma. and in other states, what the states can say there, if it comes up, is what is a difference between us and oklahoma on ballot access and ballot retention, on voter registration laws, on requirements. do we allow, like a number of the amici states, to have our minor parties select by political party convention? but all of this 
 -(43).
but, mr. dreeben, i think you're underestimating the importance of the autonomy interest because going through a criminal trial for a defendant is a very traumatic experience, not just what happens in the courtroom, but during the entire process. he has a lawyer of his own choice who's going to advise him on what he should do and how he should react to possible changes in his own condition and everything else. the  the autonomy interest is powerful in that situation.
 in district court. which hadn't been raised, your honor, and i'm having to wing it. but that's  (laughter.)
the problem with granting a safe harbor for above cost input purchases is that it does not work well in this context, especially in an inelastic market. the suggestion that you can simply use incremental cost is not a workable approach here if you look at the facts in this case.
well, the jury did determine, at the guilt phase, that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. and the fundamental point of the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the highest standard of law  of proof known to the law, short of absolute certainty. and i think, turning to this court's case law in the mitigation area, this court has, time and time again, limited mitigating evidence to evidence concerning the character or record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense. and the reason for that, i think, is that the very concept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose that the defendant has committed the crime in the first place. to put it another way, mitigating evidence is evidence that suggests that a defendant who has committed the crime is somehow less deserving of the death penalty. and going back to 
thank you. i'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.
well, may  may i ask you to focus this way, just going one step further than the hypo you've got? let's assume that the  that the defendant engages in extortion against a and makes a lot of money doing it. as a result of that, in  in dealing with b, the defendant, in fact, can  can offer  offer goods for sale to b's customers at a lower price simply because he's getting all this income from the extortion. in that case, wouldn't your analysis be the same as your analysis in this case?
wow. it goes all the way up on appeal and the jury  i  i don't know what the  i guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and recommences the trial? wow.
what does this have to do with it? the royal navy you say?
yes.
but are you saying that if the doctor is using it, saying, "in my medical judgment, this makes people happy; and, therefore, i'm going to prescribe it," that a state could permit that? wouldn't the moore case rule that out?
that's right, and the court also didn't make the finding 
can you tell us 
so it didn't, in fact, come to grips with the evidence.
who cares?
the town can't regulate it and if they are running a business on it, and we believe this is contrary to state law, but if they are running a business on it they're not collecting sales taxes.
yes, your honor, but they've also imposed limitations that are generally  that generally constrain the awards of costs in cases. they have not done what  what i understood justice alito  his question to  to get to, was to use this as  as a broad, open door. i'd like to talk about the legislative history, and particularly i'd like to respond to justice scalia's comment about the conference report in this case. this statute was changed dramatically in conference. it does not reflect either the house bill or the senate bill. if one reads the conference report in the joint explanatory statement of the committee of the conference, which is three pages long, one will see that there were dramatic and substantial changes made because there were substantial disagreements between the house and the senate, not on the question of reimbursement of expert costs. that  that provision  that understanding was shared on a bipartisan basis in both houses. but the 
very well, mr. verrilli. mr. clement, we'll hear from you.
 define 
yes, we do, your honor. after april 20th, of course, in accordance with this court's decisions in spencer v. kemna and lane v. williams, the court needs to look for a collateral consequence of the official then-expired sentence. and, in this case, we point to the possibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of imprisonment  which, of course, will not give excess prison time back to mr. toledo-flores  but even to reduce the number of the sentence, on paper, could be a favorable factor for him to get a waiver of inadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant visa in the future to come visit his u.s.-citizen children.
that's right, justice scalia, because there is an independent requirement that probable cause must exist at the time of the execution of the warrant. officers are 
do  do we know that? i mean, couldn't someone  i  i don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say i want to set up an ira, but i want the ira to be, in  in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? and couldn't someone, using both the ira mechanism and a state irrevocable trust document, create an ira that would be as restricted as  as the circuit suggested it might be?
we believe that totten didn't know to make a claim other than contract.
i mean, it's  there's no doubt the statute should be read as a whole. but, as this court has explained in cases like the o'gilvie and vonn cases cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that when congress faces a specific dispute and amends a statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative inference, especially here, as the court of appeals pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.
your honor, i think it negates it in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt. they were instructed that they must find that.
 was so 
no, your honor, i don't believe so. we're asking for a specific process here. and ms. gonzales wants the right to prove a pattern and practice on the part of castle rock of not responding properly to complaints and pleas of this type.
okay.
yes, but mr. cruz, is it not true that if he did fail to preserve the objection then there should have been a procedural bar to the case going forward?
where does it appear in the licensing agreement?
well 
yes. that's exactly what 
what would happen if when this program was set up, nothing said about faith whatsoever? this was just going to be a general program of outreach to community service organizations, but plaintiffs claimed that as the program was being administered it was heavily favoring religious organizations. would that come out the same way in your judgment?
how does that occur?
yes, your honor, there is a harmless error, but before we even get to harmless error, the fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the california supreme court under aedpa is not sufficient.
i would not say it's a contract with the government, and that's not our situation.
yes, your honor, but i believe also that you should have  give some respect, too, to this court's prior orders and this court's prior decisions. in citizens publishing, the court left alone the joint venture, and it separated out the pricing and took it out and cut it out.
can we  can we go back 
you have to show what before recovery? you have to show?
it did. but is there anything in the sixth amendment that forbids that?
your honor 
so if that's correct  if  if that's correct, what is the difference if the joint venture decides that it's going  they're going to make more money having two separate brands and even though it's equilon gas, the people are going to think it's different because some people have always bought from texaco and others from shell? it's not going to affect how the profits are distributed. it's still going to be the same whether it's equilon gas or texaco and shell. why does the joint venture lose the authority to set the price of its product?
well, the petitioner has conceded, as i understand it  i heard mr. long, i think, concede  that possession offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of cocaine. all of those are specified as being  of being felonies under the  under 940  or 844. but, beyond that, it's important to take into account that a lot of state statutes dealing with drugs do not  are not patterned directly after the federal statute, and there's official no reason why congress would have insisted that they do so in order for this statute to operate sensibly. and one notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that certainly would create a strong implication that the defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or intended to. the federal statute deals with that by making it a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug. a number of states don't do that. they, instead, have graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. they're getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a different way.
whether waiver occurred or not.
and her mother or sister and, i think, father wanted to come in and  and bring claims that were entirely derivative of the injured child's claim.
 retains 
well, but 
well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. this court has already 
what  what is the line? i mean, is there  there no point at which he can't change? i mean 
justice breyer, most states have a rule for minor parties. they don't treat, like oklahoma does, you're either a party or you're a nothing.
i don't understand how that's a resolution of the question.
suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful. lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, i believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and i nonetheless go ahead and do it. is that a willful violation?
are you  are you saying the california courts would tolerate a situation where a member of the bar told one of his employees to misrepresent to the court?
he was retained.
suppose that the plaintiff here alleged that the tax deed were forged, that the occupant simply forged the tax deed and was occupied under forgery. state cause of action there?
well 
on the nominal-party assumption.
but as justice souter brought  questioned whether the prosecution was procured for unconstitutional reasons, the immunity of the prosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which the prosecution is brought. it only protects him from civil damage liability. the investigators themselves have no such immunity. it is qualified.
yes, but do you want add the for example or do you want to take it just categorically?
you know, and my next question is going to be, if you say it would come out differently, then isn't  isn't it sort of silly to make the state go on and say that? if they could do the same thing by simply reciting what's going to happen, why  why should we make them do that?
i'm trying to get from you what is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in oklahoma, say.
 there was no reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in abdul-kabir or mr. cole's case.
so the only part of the california system that creates a problem is this  the one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.
well 
well, the cases say it matters what the congress saw at the time it passed the statute in brown and block. but the reason it does matter as a logical matter is that the state of the law was such that third parties couldn't bring a refund suit under 1346. the actions that had been allowed, your honor, were against the irs officials and those were expressly replaced by the statute. congress expressly replaced them in section 7426(d) and (e), which is on 12a of our, of our petition. so that shows that congress did intend to make this the exclusive remedy. the other reason why i think you can 
 to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive work environment?
so, your approach introduces, really, a third concept. you have the principal activities and you have  either preliminary or postliminary  and now you've got a third concept: integral. but the statute  that's nowhere in the statute.
where the question is, should an unnamed party citizenship "be" regarded?
aren't they equally precise here?
would you refresh my recollection? in the cases you cited at the outset of your argument, where the judgments were reversed, am i wrong in thinking, in those cases, there was, in fact, a new trial afterwards?
mr. olson, does brand competition generally help retailers, or is this a question that can't be answered?
actually, i don't know, your honor. and, i just don't know whether it's patented but it is certainly not covered by their claims 1 through 12, which have never been  well, the district court found that those claims didn't apply here, and that's not an issue. the abbott method is different. it's an immunoassay. it is not the same kind of mass spectometry gas chromatograph method that they have described. it's much more efficient, it's much more cost-effective and the reason obviously that labcorp wants to use that method is to more effectively serve patients and their doctors and to meet the burgeoning demand for homocysteine tests. but because these patentees have effectively claimed the patent on the natural correlation that's associated with all homocysteine tests, they have prevented labcorp from using what the patent laws would seek to encourage, that is, a more cost-effective, innovative, different method, the kind of thing  exactly the kind of thing that the court was concerned about in morse.
okay. the issue in this court is whether the federal takings claim should be precluded under issue preclusion by a state court judgment that did not decide the federal takings claim and could not have decided the federal takings claim.
that's right, but the very author of the opinion in bulger, chief justice corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of  of an order denying leave to appeal in the michigan court of appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.
yes. well, i think that, that is precisely what we are saying. but you know, judge tatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong. because the interpretation of modification under nsps and under the regulatory psd was identical. the regulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard because if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know, the modification, this is the nsps definition  i'm sorry, better go back a page. 17a. 60.14 modification defines emission rate and the emission rate is expressed as kilogram per hour. so that is absolutely clear that that is the nsps  dobbs modification.
and they will decide what looks like the alaska 
isn't  isn't it the case that she can have her claim and she can prove her claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment unless the living trust is invalid? but that's not what we're litigating here, is it?
all right. all that's true, but the question that i think justice ginsburg asked was you have on your side the whole national defense industrial association. you have the equal employment advisory council that represents dozens and dozens, i take it, of businesses. we have your own client. we have you in the firm. everybody. i imagine you all racked your brains to say has there ever been such an example, and i take the answer is no, never. not all of you could even find one instance where this happened. now, am i right? because that's what i think unless you provide the example.
but i thought that the argument on the other side is that those references in the secondary sources and in the document itself are meant to make clear that if the individual detainee does not want contact with his consular officials, for example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or something like that, that it was, as you said earlier, his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a departure from the norm in international  the international context where treaties are between the sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on individuals.
how do, how do you square your objective of achieving racial balance with your disinterest in the situation at cleveland and rainier beach? those are the most unbalanced schools under your definition, and yet those are not affected at all by this plan. why, why are you not concerned about that?
that is the secretary's traditional way of doing things 
but you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees. that's what really this is about, isn't it?
yes.
under any guideline system, whether it's mandatory or advisory, once  if you have a mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate review, once the appellate review function has been performed, will it not be the case that trial judges will not have unfettered discretion, will have very limited discretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy determinations? that's the whole purpose of a guidelines system. that the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how severe they think an individual crime is, that there's supposed to be some kind of uniformity.
well, that's exactly what the point  that our point is, is that, because the government, in this case in  and the court, in kosak, has told us that automobile accidents are not barred, are  from  by  they're not barred 
what's your response to all this?
well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case. i'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win. but that isn't what the government says. the government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary. we  like my draft. i write drafts all the time. so  so do trial judges. and he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it. and they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document. and that different document, of course, is totally public. the whole opinion of the tax court. there is that document.
yes, i know. right now i'm asking 
putting that 
under the parity requirement, what the university is compelled to do is sit down with the employers and help counsel them on what their students are interested in and how best to shape the message. the third circuit went out of its way to point out that, and the national association for law placement brief is very compelling on that. they also have to disseminate literature, post bulletins on bulletin boards, help the recruiter  or, excuse me, the law firm develop cocktail parties 
it may be.
it will never be the cause of the discovery of the physical evidence found 
that when the  basically when the police report is unambiguous and when the documents in the state court file indicate that the basis for the guilty plea was the crime described in the police report, that you can infer that the factual basis for the plea, which is required under massachusetts law, was in fact the breaking into a building as opposed to a ship or a vehicle and so forth.
louie predicted that there would be no liability. and, in fact, i think that that remains the law.
you bring in the insurer in a third party  in a third party claim under rule 14. okay? that claim doesn't satisfy the $75,000, whatever the amount-in-controversy requirement is that applies, because you've got a  a retention. okay? then  and so your  your claim against them is only for $50,000. that wouldn't satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement but it does satisfy the supplemental jurisdiction over claims brought separately.
well, i think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. so let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have ira's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the ira now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.
that's 
i'm willing to concede that because it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an impediment that trying to get into federal court, trying to get here, for that matter, trying to get into federal district court  for an indigent, a typical person who is very likely  someone like mr. carter, functionally illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his rights, to try and navigate the  the procedural hurdles of the michigan system to get all the way through the michigan system and then into federal court, that is a daunting hurdle. and that's evitts v. lucey. this court has recognized time and time again in  in plea cases, roe v.  roe v. flores-ortega. this court has recognized time and time again in peguero that even in a plea case a typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or her case held  heard, especially if you have to go through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for the first tier. and that is the problem here. on the merits, i certainly would like to correct mr. casey's representations about the  the nature of the michigan system. the  a properly filed application for leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented. i certainly urge this court to look at each and every one of the cases that mr. casey has cited for the proposition that that is not a determination on the merits because not one of them says that. not one of them specifically says that a order denying leave for lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision on the merits.
thank you, mr. schaerr. general clement, you have four minutes remaining.
for such a doctor, a doctor who thinks that i'm trying to remove in this emergency situation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be thinking what i think is likely to happen here, i'll make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it will come out and then the head of the fetus will dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out. is that 
the fec administers that. that's 
well, he found that the numbers are such that they could, but did he find  and i'm not sure of this. did he find that the actual people who migrated would otherwise have voted differently so that in fact it made a difference?
ms.  ms. karlan, you have a  a statutory claim that essentially mirrors the constitutional claim. the statute requires the testing to be random and impartial. if we think there's a difference between the constitutional claims and statutory claims with respect to their treatment under the csra, how do you handle that? does he have to exhaust the statutory claim but not the constitutional one?
no, he's not. but if  if  where i'm really coming from, to be honest  and i'd like  you might as well reply to what i'm actually  is why i'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (laughter.)
well, i believe 
which currently requires that the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be correct.
the rule that we propose, which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some sort if the fourth amendment claim is being actively litigated in the state court at that time, has two advantages. the first is that it does serve the purposes that all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts the defendant on notice you are now the defendant in a lawsuit, you should be marshalling your evidence, you should be preserving your records, and you are not in repose. this court has respected those as very important interests. they are absolutely not served by a rule of delayed accrual. at the same time, the rule to allow a stay where necessary - as i indicated, it's not going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to figure it out. the federal district court figures it out by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who is a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a question: are you currently 
if you abandon the car wherever you happen to be that's not joy riding. that's covered by traditional larceny principles. in the, the case of state v. davis from 1875 involves that exact principle. that is larceny in that case. but however, if someone takes a car, a teenager, a neighbor takes a car, drives it around the block, brings it back to the same place, that is joyriding. that is covered by 108.51.
we 
 i suppose the public might have an interest in knowing about this debate. i don't know if you can say there are no public interest served. it might be that there are other counterbalancing first  interests, but i don't think you could say we have no interest in speech. this was  this is a  on its face, a rather interesting  a rather interesting argument that they're  that they're having.
you did, an as-replied challenge to the specific grants. but there were specific grants identified and there was an as-applied challenge. but the argument was 
i'm assuming it was 
 that are supposed to represent you 
 could enact a statute authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?
 then it's an exercise in the conceivable, it seems to me.
there were 
while under the court's retroactivity jurisprudence griffith would control, under 2254 it would not. 22(d)(1) would control.
which the court of appeals hasn't done.
 for allowing it than  than yours?
as far as using the machinery that was used in brown?
yes, but i looked at martin linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of acquittal entered. here we have an endorsement on a motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying  what does the entry say? motion granted or something like that.
no, it doesn't. but i mean, i did get notice of it. it came in the mail, but it doesn't 
strange phrase, to mean "feeding to livestock"?
well, then you get into certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the court gave to it. but here certainly this order is not unreasonable. it's certainly within the confines. and you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal by this date.
 this 
 issue goes directly to your affirmative defense.
 difference in the burden of proof. he has the burden of proof to get the affirmative defense or to get the  in that category.
in respect to the language, how do you read it? i think it's ambiguous. "to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities." do you read it  "different purchaser"  "to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased"? do you read it "to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities  i.e., the commodity, the particular item  the commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to which there is the discrimination"? how do you want to read it, literally? i just want your 
that's correct. but what's significant here is that this was a judge-conducted voir dire where juror 16 would have been facing the judge when giving her answer. so the judge would have been in the best position to see the 
i  i think that that's completely wrong. when congress has created  has recognized a right, as this court has found is essential for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause of action in court in particular, then that's the function of 1983, is to serve  it provides a cause of action for people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory violation. but where congress has given thought to what kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983 action to undo all of the things that congress provided for.
yes 
that would save us a lot of work. we  (laughter.)
right. but the answer to justice breyer it seems to me has to be that you can only consider it in the, in the context of deliberateness or future dangerousness.
well, why  why not? suppose  suppose most people look at the web site and they don't listen to the  listen to the radio. i think certainly mccain-feingold should be extended to that under your view.
i think 
yes.
how could you possibly give a warning in this situation?
that would be correct, your honor, that 
the respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.
thank you, mr. nolas.
 the same as any corporation.
that was just a preliminary. in fact, what it was was a person displaying this banner in a quiet, passive manner that didn't interfere with anybody's observation.
separately.
i don't mean the training to make the dog alert properly. how the police will use them, when, under what circumstances.
the  the 
but they're not entitled to parole.
that  that is correct, and then the district court 
 the 
it is not a component 
i mean, that's expressed and principal purpose. you know the hypothetical.
 do we have  do we have any empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem argument?
let me  let me ask you this question so far as the rights of the assignee and the assignor. suppose it's a very weak case and the litigant says i want to settle for 20 cents on the dollar. are you saying that there's some kind of duty to notify the state and  and to consult with the state before this is done?
 cases.
thank you, counsel.
it is not a question of cal  it is a question of english.
thank you, mr. dabney. mr. hungar.
which is?
yes, but the state doesn't go that far. if it doesn't require the defendant to persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence, then there's no constitutional violation. if the  if the rule of state law simply requires a consideration of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation to the defense evidence, that's  that's all right?
well, first of all, i don't  i think it's just counterfactual to think that there is going to be overwhelming infringing use of the ipod in the way that there indisputably is here. second, to the extent you get the closer cases, it is our position, as i gather it is the position of the united states, that you look at  to see what kind of business model the defendant is operating under. is it a  is it  are they marketing it for legitimate purposes? are they taking reasonable steps to prevent infringement? if they are, then they  then they're not liable. third 
and  and this is in the context of 13 a prosecutor who elicited that mr. rompilla had been 14 paroled 3 and a half months before the offense, that his 15 niece and nephew were scared of him, that he could not 16 rehabilitate yourself. indeed, i  i urge the court to 17 read the cross examination of the defense witnesses at the 18 penalty phase. it's short, it's narrow, and it focuses on 19 this guy couldn't rehabilitate himself. this guy was just 20 paroled 3 and a half months and then goes and commits this 21 brutal murder. and this guy's niece and nephew are afraid 22 of him. that's the context. also, the prior victim 
 the "much more" is the questions that the jury asked?
well, i don't really think 
we have massive cross summary judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go to trial on that  on our claim of liability.
 for excusing them.
even if he's insane. official
yes, inverse  reverse piercing.
 in this case?
but it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation. but what we would have 
that's not what the  this is  the  the form of dismissal in the florida supreme court doesn't tell us that. it just says something about allegations contained therein do not constitute legal grounds for granting the new trial.
yes 
but if she was the vice principal, that would be  then it would come 
they didn't have the authority to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land. they allege that he had made various technical violations on account of which they canceled it. but the key point is, that was supposed to be the quid pro quo, that is, they have maintained all along that this case is about that right-of-way and what an ingrate the respondent is that he wants to continue enjoying it and not give the easement. well, he didn't enjoy it after july of 1995 when it was canceled. they wouldn't have had to cancel it for alleged violations.
suppose the state  suppose the state is involved in the negotiations and they disagree. the  the parties in good faith say, we've got to settle this for 20 percent. the state said, oh, your case is much better than that. please don't settle. then what?
that is absolutely right  correct, justice souter, which is why i answered your very early question with 
and aren't you concerned that that creates an incentive in every case for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the police are going to have to give up eventually?
thank you, mr. lamken. the case is taken  is  as submitted.
that's what i was wondering, because 
but do you have any 21 explanation of why your client waited so long?
 was it that she 
but it'd be sometimes wrong no matter how you define final. i mean, you know, she let's 
the  the insurance company potentially would have double liability under arkansas law if  if the claim is settled and they know the subrogation claim and 
was 
yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements. what am i supposed to do with that? i mean, i know what you said. and you said your best. and that's your best.
well, the way judge posner explains it in high fructose is to say that it is possible to have an agreement without a moment where there's a statement of agreement. the participants in a conspiracy can possibly treat what one of them does as an offer, which another one can accept by following it, to satisfy that way of showing a conspiracy.
those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up. i mean, i'm not following  i think i think this argument about the word is metaphysical, you know, and i can make wonderful arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this. i just can't get a clear answer. so if i were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language, then the thing, i'd like to go back to justice stevens' question, because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns are practical. if we take your position, we have words right next to each other, near each other in the same statutory provision, meaning different things. and i've learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up. and they will get mixed up all the time, and when they get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have. the second concern of justice stevens, which is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem. because on a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very good supreme court case. and that's going to be the case where he forgets to file in the federal court because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and behold, the court grants it. and now what happens? on your interpretation, i just see a mess, and on the other interpretation, it seems to work out fine. so those, i would say are the two practical problems, and anything you would like to say about that, i'd like to listen to.
i'm sorry.
well, but we have  we have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of substantial medical judgment. it can't be an idiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.
it doesn't change everything, justice scalia, precisely for the reasons that you discussed in your opinion for the court in rav versus st. paul, the st. paul cross-burning case, where you pointed out that, that the greater includes the lesser argument does not apply where you have content discrimination. the state could justifiably ban all symbols and displays that involve fighting words, but it could not single out a particular 
at that 
but you were wise enough not to ask for that. (laughter) official
all right, but i mean, i  i take it that it is their law, otherwise i'd see reversal, wouldn't i, and not affirmance?
 because 
yes, your honor. i believe the seventh circuit as well and the first circuit.
it's not 
yes, if it is a legitimate tactic, recognized  as an attorney, if there is a  some means that is available to use so that you do not have to use a peremptory strike 
 in payton with 
but the state of washington seems to think that's fine for everything other than election expenses.
well, then we just throw this to the birds on the trier of fact in every case 
to  to a jailhouse informant, yes, your honor. and the prosecutor put that evidence on at trial, at wesley's trial, but it's interesting to note what he did with that evidence at wesley's trial. he put it on but then in closing very expressly noted that while there's been this evidence, even if you don't believe he's the principal offender, you can still find him guilty of aggravated murder.
right.
yes, but there would be sales if they were selling from inventory. i mean, there would have been a preceding sale, and the sale would have been at differential prices, as between two dealers.
so in the eleventh circuit they have determined that. but again, we submit under that russello presumption or even the statute itself, congress enumerated those four property crimes, primarily property crimes.
that's exactly what they said, your honor. and we say they had no authority to do that. in the absence of taking it in the first instance before the trial court. may i reserve 
thank you, general petro.
well, then you still haven't said anything. i thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures. but if all the procedures are given and they're still not satisfied with the public education that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming that it was inadequate under the terms of the act. you think they can sue then, too, as well.
and it's in 925(c), which is on 
do you know anybody in the justice department you might talk to to amend this form so that the form says this includes convictions in foreign countries?
findings to substantiate 
thank you. mr. srinivasan.
does the state have to  does the constitution have to let you off if that's the situation?
 as a practical matter, it may be very difficult to 
thank you, mr. nager. mr. gornstein?
thank you, mr. poe. the case is submitted.
 the issue is not whether there is a discharge, as i see it. the issue is whether there's a "discharge into the river." and one does not usually speak of the "river discharging into itself." that  it's the "into" that's the crucial part. how do you distinguish this case from miccosukee, if i'm saying it right?  yes, miccosukee 
okay. there are a few points embedded in the question, and i'd like to take them one by one. with respect to the standard, the standard is, if the employer makes a judgment that the public employee has not performed his or her job properly or has been insubordinate, so long as that judgment isn't based on a censorial type motive, like, "we don't tolerate criticism of the sheriff's department," something like that, then the employer's judgment prevails. and i'm not suggesting that a district  federal district court has license to second-guess that judgment, so long as that judgment's actually the judgment that was made. i mean, there's a pretext analysis that might be made in this case 
 if your opponent acknowledges that  or stipulates, in effect, that he's not going to put anything in except what's already in the transcript? then do we have a case?
no, they don't, justice scalia.
what do you say about his hypothetical involving democrats versus republicans?
they do not. first of all, if the occ  if congress intends to alter the balance that i spoke of earlier, it must do so with clear and manifest language. there must be unmistakably clear language that congress intended to authorize the occ to preempt the state law.
and yes, but one of the things, it seems to me, you're all overlooking is that if it's as obvious as they're all blind, those would be challenges for cause.
the  the juveniles. but the defendants in this case were the adults inside the home.
and the guidance does come from the other instructions that tell the jury what the specific questions are that they must answer in the penalty phase, and what they take into account in answering those questions.
i don't think so, your honor. a court in  in our view 
but the question is who tells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell you about that choice.
oh, i'm sorry.
don't you think that if a state listed specific factors that could be taken into account, and no others, that there would be considerable doubt whether this court would allow such a statute to stand?
well, i'm  i'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees.
i  i think it would be within the  the trial court's discretion to exclude it. i certainly don't think it would necessarily violate the due process 
no, it's not, your honor.
 it's been a background principle of government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that  that the government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out. so i think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.
was there an allegation that the company, petitioner, or whatever it was  that they violated the act?
 under rule 14 joined another person.
i understand that argument, justice ginsburg, but i believe when congress enacted 106(a), (b), and (c), that they enacted it  (a), being those actions which were abrogated, (b) were those actions that remained. and those actions that remained, there were limitations to that waiver. because this is not  there was nothing to waive on sovereign immunity on 106(b) as to preference actions, for example. contract claims are different. contract claims would have  are not abrogated under 106(a), so, therefore, the only way they can be waived is under 106(b).
but it was argued.
i would state, your honor, that the assignment of income doctrine simply does not apply when the  the client has no control or power of disposition over the income that was subject to the assignment. there are at least five reasons why this type of contract 
the gold foods case, the 
well, if it is  what i'm wondering is if this is similar to that insurance case out of california, where, in fact, we gave considerable deference to mr. eisenstat's interpretation of the relationship of the treaty to the insurance laws of california.
he said there's a growing concern over the issuance of business method patents.
but we have just pointed out that it  that it  it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.
no, your honor.
 it was a reasonable time to file is a state-law question.
 that they 
your honor, under california law, i'm not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason. i'm just 
excellent. now, if i don't get the decal, because i didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the ssi. it is a charge for a decal which shows that i registered the icc and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.
i have a question, if i can, if we should reach the merits of the case 
if there's a  mr. chief justice, if there's a significant limit on the time of the execution of the warrant, then that does become part of the particularity clause.
well, i mean, putting aside the fact, your honor, that i think that that's essentially a jury question  i mean, i do think both sides get to put on the evidence that shows that there's been discrimination and that there  and then we know what the market consequences will be. but if you look at plaintiff's exhibit 104, which is in the appendix to the court of appeals at 577, and you look down that list, you will see that they are  where they're specifically talking about reeder-simco, and it has  and it satisfies its 28 percent of its overall objective in 1999; and then you go through the testimony of reeder-simco's co-owner, and he's  identifies each of the four or five competing entities that were the beneficiaries of those  of the price discrimination of those sales in the 102 sales that were the basis for liability; and their percentages for the objectives during the next  during 1999 are 71 percent, 81 percent, 97 percent, 107 percent, 92 percent  those are  those are huge differentials.
well 
in evansville airport, your honor, this court held that  versus delta airlines  that a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has to be a relationship between the cost of a service and the amount that's charged.
 but not for drugs? and the drug addict can be searched for drugs, and not burglar tools?
in  in the briefs as well.
well, in your hypothetical  and if i could turn to that  i still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this court, in a series of cases, including darby, wickard, wirtz, and perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. and, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other schedule i substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.
i thought it was. i may be wrong about that.
we all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month. absolutely illegal, isn't it?
in this case, it's very significant that she relied on the unconstitutional reason.
well, this shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant 
thank you 
thank you, mr. smith. ms. perales.
well, if we 
yes, and that discussion explains a couple of things. it explains that if there is a likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the outer limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use. it also points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant to that determination that your honor just described. yes, we would win under that position, your honor, that's absolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the restatement 
again, i don't think that's  that faithfully represents what the opinion said. i think the opinion covered  including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.
well, that may be clear but it may be clearly wrong. (laughter.)
then 
it gave  it gave the prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.
no, your honor, i don't believe it was.
so why  why isn't there a clear difference between the two?
because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place 
can you turn to sovereign immunity now?
well, i think  i think the theory of the application of the presumption is, first of all, obviously, if the whole product is patented, then the presumption would be applicable. but i think there also is an argument that even if some component is  is patented, that component, because it's in that product, gives that product market power because the theory would go the patent would exclude the ability of other competitors in the market to use that component.
 so there was no  there was no statute of limitations applying to the social security act; and then, in 1996, they say, "and now go get them."
but there would be a logical connection for those who want to get married.
well, i think there's some truth to that, justice scalia, but let me say this. i think what i'm saying is, i'm taking the rational that this court accepted in wickard, and i'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. here, congress 
that  that decision would be reviewable here, your honor. it's an unnecessary multiple layers of appeals and going through the state system to decide a federal question that congress wanted to have decided in the federal courts.
do they have lawyers in those cases?
so you just want us to say, look, the ninth circuit is wrong. they're okay to have conditional warrants like this and there is no absolute rule you always have to have the triggering condition in. as to whether this is too confusing or not too confusing, send them back and let them figure it out.
 is that 
yes.
okay.
you've never said it, your honor and the question has never been presented. a similar question was presented in the university of michigan law school case. and this court held the use of a racial classification to satisfy a compelling interest and in a narrowly tailored manner 
 granddaddy of all cases. the assignment there, although it was between family members, had been made before there was an income tax.
no, but if they find  if they agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then they allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of death. isn't that right?
what is  what is the basis for their doing it? if there is currently no hydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no  there is no connection to the navigable waters of the united  what could possibly be the basis for their asserting jurisdiction?
what was your response to the motion to dismiss? the government said that you didn't raise, in response to the motion to dismiss, any assertion that private individuals would be liable 
no, but unilateral conduct where you have monopoly power. there aren't too many of these cases, as you know.
and the judge could dismiss the others.
i think 
no.
well 
what's the cite on that that i  that i need for 
but i thought  correct me if i'm wrong, just as a matter of fact  i thought his 1983 claim listed the speech to the mexican-american bar association as one of the reasons that he was demoted, or whatever it was, transferred.
because, as i read your briefing, it was, "well, they can argue about some bad things that grokster was doing in the past, but this decision says: henceforth, what we're doing is okay. the case zeroed in on now and the future, and the only thing that was left open was something that is over and gone could get damages for it." but i thought that this judgment gave you an okay, a green light, from now on.
no, your honor; i'm saying that .
mr. waxman.
 what the maryland court of 
you may not have recoverable damages. that is true.
 is that 
piecemeal.
oh, it's the eighth circuit. excuse me.
for a house. $300 for the senate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office, including the governor. that's $200 for an election for governor. you throw in contributions in kind. you say that the political parties themselves cannot give more than that $200 for an election for the governor. if we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just the numbers justice scalia mentioned, and i would like to know why are they  why does not give incumbents a tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of spending as a challenger. in other words, why aren't these limits far too low?
well, i don't  i don't think that lawsuit could be brought, mr. chief justice, and let me explain why. we think that the limitations that are in this court's opinions require the taxpayer to identify a discrete and identifiable non-incidental expenditure. in other words, it's not just any 
or a good friend.
which is why there's a significant difference between the agency saying that for 60 years, and i think this court stressed that in its opinion, and congress reacting to that, what the agency's position was. and here where it's a newly minted position, because the agency's position not too long ago was that they did have the authority.
justice breyer 
well, two things about that.
they have the right  they have the right to the hearing. but do they have the right 
right, your honor.
and do you think we resolved the statutory construction issue that you're now arguing very carefully at this time?
another employer's plan.
well, maybe they assumed that the medical health exception of the sort you're arguing for is not constitutionally required and that's what would be litigated in a narrow focused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a bypass procedure. maybe they assumed it would follow the salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry about severing in light of particular unconstitutional applications.
why? why? why? that is to say, what the finding is, is that there was a different matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go draw it up so i can give gifts to her, the increase in the value of my property during the 13 months we're married, do it, and they never did it. now, that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with the grat trust or with the will. it just happens that those are evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely happened with the catchall trust. so i don't see why those are necessary. i don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and i don't see whether or not those are barred, those particular facts have anything to do with this, as far as jurisdiction is concerned. now, explain to me why i'm wrong.
right.
well, our view  well, what ought to happen in this case is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed because the court failed to require loss causation. in effect, what the court said is that transaction causation is sufficient. but what 
number one, it can't be waived, right?
that 
i think that's an accurate statement outside of the erisa context, justice stevens, that there are courts that enforce one form of make-whole that might not. but there are many states that do enforce a 
on your question  the  i'm sorry.
so, compliance 
excuse me?
 a brand-new technology.
i don't think so at all. and for one  for one thing  as i've mentioned, the structure of the act, as a whole, of 1101(a)(43)  and there are numerous subsections  look to how the crime  what the authorized punishment was, or look to how the person was actually sentenced under state law, not under federal law.
well, first, your honor, i don't think we have to guess what the judges would do because the judges did what they did. they denied the motion to vacate and then 
no, no. the  the amicus from the  representing cruz.
but, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.
well, if that's a winning  of course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in fact, it's an interference  look, every upstream tax raises the price of goods and services. every upstream tax  indeed, every tax in the world  makes it harder to sell the product. so, every tax makes it harder for the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody else. now, if that's the basis for saying it's an interference, then every tax is an interference. and i don't see how that could be.
and it's never been.
no, your honor. the triggering event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle in michigan.
it's interesting 
if the librarian thinks that, the legislature is not giving us enough money, so i'm going to deliberately use my authority to get an extra five cents from everybody, i suppose if you could prove willfulness, which is an important element of hobbs, and if there were several librarians and there was a pattern and you could establish the other prerequisites of rico, it could be a rico violation.
but 
how do you expect the lower state court to come out on that?
well, under teague they did not purport to change the law. but i think aedpa is a different inquiry here. we're looking at what clearly established law was at the time the state courts made their decisions and not necessarily what, you know, what the teague inquiry would be. and so at that point i think it's pretty clear under graham and johnson we're looking at some effect. whatever "full effect" means now, it doesn't apply to these cases. and i think that gets to the main point here. we're looking at an exceedingly ordinary fact pattern in a capital murder case in both of these cases: dysfunctional childhoods, a small amount of abuse in brewer, undescribed 
 if you're looking at broad market competition, you don't normally require them to identify competition on a customer  on a per-customer basis. the only reason we get into the per-customer basis is that we have this odd  not an odd situation, but the situation with volvo trucks that no dealer ever buys unless he's already got a  got a sale waiting. but in justice stevens' hypothetical, we  as long as the market was identified, and as long as they were buying, we wouldn't require anything more to show competition, would we?
justice o'connor, by the plain language of the competing harms defense, it also precludes civil liability. i would also say that that lawyer would also advise him, if given the opportunity, the attorney general is prepared also to issue an opinion describing the applicability of the competing harms defense in this very rare circumstance, should it arise.
that's correct, justice breyer.
any suspicion whatever.
right. i  i think our argument is based on the fact that we have the presumption of correctness as part of (e), which is the fact development procedure in federal court. the state's jackson argument, i'd just like to highlight, is irreconcilable with what this court said in miller-el i, and what it did in miller-el ii. in miller-el i, this court stated that federal courts can disagree with state court credibility determinations and, when guided by aedpa, determine that the conclusion is unreasonable or its factual premise rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. in miller-el ii, this court disagreed with the state court credibility determination and granted habeas relief even though the significance of some of the habeas petitioner's evidence was open to judgment calls. by contrast, this court stated in schlup v. delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally beyond the scope of review in jackson. and in the crenshaw case cited by the state, the court explained that under jackson, the test for rejecting evidence as incredible is extraordinarily stringent and is met, for example, only when the testimony given is describing facts that are physically impossible. this court couldn't have granted relief in miller-el if it construed (d)(2) or (e)(1) as containing the jackson test, and the state's approach would effectively bar habeas relief whenever a habeas petitioner challenged a credibility determination.
we lose under the state statute. no question.
right.
and it seems to me that  that your  your argument is  is at cross ends with its own purpose.
we cited 
do you 
do we have to 
only part, mr. chief justice. part of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the defendant, and we have laid before the court peer-reviewed scientific studies that show that they  that people are  frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development with race and with physical appearance. in addition, because the adolescent personality is transient and the lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense psychosocially as opposed to  in addition to physically, the person that the jury is judging is not the  is not a manifestation of the person who committed the crime.
i've got the  
would you say that it's per se unlawful?
yes, respondent concedes that their burden  that it's their burden 
 in respect to your constitutional claim? why, given the presence of section 705 of the act 
so before you go on to that, i want to be clear on your answer to title ii of the civil rights act of '64. there's  you say, well, that's easier to comply with. but that's not the principle under which you're operating.
well, the reason why they may have done that is because they've seen case after case where absolute power corrupts absolutely. and because district judges know that remand orders are not reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for reasons that are clearly improper. that may be the reason. now on your first argument, you say that what the district judge says is dispositive. you mean if the district judge says i lack subject matter jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not 
the  digital explains that if you have a right not to stand trial that is set forth in a statute or constitutional provision, that the court isn't going to second-guess the importance of that right. it's  it's unclear whether the importance prong of the collateral order test should be part of  part of that effective reviewability or whether it's part of the second prong about separate from the merits of the case. but in any event, what digital doesn't say is just because something is in a statute  a right is in a statute  it's  it  it is correct to characterize it as a right not to stand trial. to the contrary, digital cautions that anything  so many defenses could be called rights not to stand trial, and so the court will look  will apply the test very stringently. statute of limitations, for instance, are in statutes and when the statute has expired, you could say that is a statutory bar to a right to stand trial. but statute of limitations, like the res judicata defense, are just not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
but why would they use includes in that provision and means in other provisions?
your honor, no, what i  the government's position is the same position that, in fact, it urged before congress in 1946. the court's opinion in park 'n fly makes this clear. they did not want descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary meaning. and as the park 'n fly opinion makes clear, congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and included all of these other safeguards, not allowing registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses that are likely to confuse. we would also point out that that encourages economic efficiencies for businesses as well. by being able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the business invests more. as soon as confusion is allowed, there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free riding on that investment. and it's a disincentive for further investment and it undermines the quality of the goods, because the only way 
if  if the woman can take into account the impact on the fetus at a certain point in time, and your option, as you said some physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure, why is that beyond the scope of things that congress can take into account?
is that different from caplin & drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of the client and 
yes, your honor.
how many times have you used this statute to go after people who were convicted in a foreign court?
yes, but the sec could relitigate it, i would think. it wouldn't be bound by the judgment in a private suit.
no, but there's a 
so state  you don't have any problem with state judges being enlisted as officers to execute federal treaty obligations on behalf of the state department or someone?
no. they  no 
what do you mean, it doesn't work? i don't understand.
well, i don't know that i understand your answer. could the attorney general deem the authorization  purported authorization by a physician to use morphine to help with depression, or steroids for bodybuilding  can that attorney general say, under the act, that's drug abuse?
i want to be sure i understood your position with regard to justice kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him up or something like that. when does that cause of action accrue?
is it like how many other monuments? this is not peculiar to texas. the order of the eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?
yes.
given that this court's test, the question this court's modern cases ask, in distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or almost always anticompetitive. that's what the court has said.
so, what must have been the difference was that there was no discharge.
may i ask this  may i ask this question? supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of johnnie cochran's office?
it is a process difference, your honor. the 
okay.
i'm sorry. if i indicated that, i definitely misspoke. in our view, all fourth amendment claims except for those that do negate an element of the offense, and those are described in footnote 6 of heck, with that exception, all fourth amendment claims should be regarded as accruing at the time that the act that actually violates the fourth amendment occurs.
well, i think that, i don't see any reason why a principle which this court has repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase of a capital trial.
yes, sir, on a felony 
right. that's what i'm  that's what i'm getting at. and  and what i'm troubled by is i  i take your  i understand your point, that it's not appropriate for him to speculate and supply an answer at stage two. but if stage one  at stage one, the objector has satisfied the test and at stage three, the  the court may, nonetheless, reject the challenge, i don't know what he would be rejecting the challenge for unless it is on the basis of this kind of, as you put it, speculation about what the reasons might be. so help me out there.
has factor (k) been supplemented with a caljic instruction since payton?
well, your honor, because of the spending-clause nature of the legislation. that's what we think, that 
i don't agree that i need another fallback position, because i believe that if the court finds that right to counsel  giving him counsel is not enough, other things i'm about to tell the court, i think, will also be a factor. for example, telling the defendant that he, in fact, does not face the death penalty. very interestingly, this court  and the seibert case, in fact, justice kennedy's opinion, said that one of the things you consider is, when there is a violation of the right to miranda rights, you tell the suspect, "that was an improper violation of your right. that statement may not be admissible" 
 in california.
i  i deny the first thing, that it's easy to do issue ads without naming the candidate. the  the point of an issue ad is to put pressure on  on the candidate that you want to vote your way. without  without telling people to call  not the candidate  the  the incumbent that you want to vote your way  without telling people to call the office of that incumbent, you're not doing very much.
i suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?
thank you, counsel. mr. kuntz, you have 4 minutes remaining.
some judges too. right?
i'm asking you what you tell the inmate, not what initiates your process. now, please answer my question.
your honor, those are other terms that are used in the statute, those are separate requirements. there are four requirements in the provision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in good faith, and used fairly. they read "used fairly" right out of the language.
well then, what do you do about 2254(e)(1), or i guess (e)(2), which seems to suggest at different rule if a case is made retroactive?
negligent 
yes.
justice ginsburg, i don't want to be insensitive to  to witnesses in this situation. of course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but  but in domestic violence, it's an acute problem. however, we believe the proper way to deal with that situation is by this court developing its forfeiture doctrine. the sixth amendment applies across the board to all criminal cases, justice ginsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix to our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple years that have been handled in a victimless fashion like this that are not domestic violence cases 
no, not  no. he's  he's not  if he was repeating what was said in the affidavit, that's a different point. he's repeating the statement that was made before the affidavit was given. that was at a point at which the  there was still an immediate danger and that he was asking a question that was reasonably necessary to determine whether that danger existed and, if so, how to resolve it.
it  the bankruptcy court in the new case said  pardon? the bankruptcy court in the new case said that there are circumstances under which a debtor would have standing. this was in effect a new rule of law for that, for this district. so subsequent to that decision we did, in fact, object to quite a number of claims and substantially reduced the total of those claims, and i think that once 
i would like to suggest to the court three avenues to reach this result that i have just suggested and the partnership/joint venture theory is only one of those.
mr. wesley.
no, your honor. and the reason is, enmons says there's a special legislative history of the hobbs act specifically about labor. and enmons concluded that if the violence is part of a strike to pursue lawful union activities, it is not actionable under the hobbs act. nothing that this court would decide here would change that specific protection of unions, one that's codified in the statute. as to your former question, nor would ruling in favor of respondents here change the criminal laws you suggest. the statute would only apply to a plan to obstruct interstate commerce by physical violence or threats of violence. your honor, this is an interpretation 
 fundamental principle.
mr. farr, would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have  in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language?
and i'd like to answer the reason for that, because we think the jury is entitled to see her demeanor and gauge, based on how she testifies, how believable she is. we think it's much  we think it's better for a jury to be able to see a live witness than hear a cold transcript being read by surrogates. and so, of course, in  as we know, in  if she were to stray from what she testified at the original trial, of course she would be impeached with, "well, you didn't testify about that the first time." but the jury, we think, as the statute clearly indicates, should allow witnesses who testified originally to be recalled, unless, for some reason, they're unavailable 
certainly.
well, let me ask you this. do you think that it's possible that in some instances it is a valid strategy to focus on the punishment/sentencing phase rather than the guilt phase if the lawyer has reviewed all the evidence and it appears to the lawyer to be overwhelming? is it possible that there's a case where a strategy such as this might make sense?
quite the reverse. and it says to join the u.s. as a necessary party defendant in a suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity in the united states regarding any contract executed pursuant. now, i guess the farmers were not technically the contracting entity.
do we 
thank you, mr. mertz. mr. starr, you have a minute remaining.
yeah, and so i think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference. you see, that's  that's the dilemma. and i don't see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference, without actually producing a dichotomy. and so either congress can do it or it can't, and  and  and that's  and we could fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment. but i don't 
no, your argument right now.
thank you, your honor. (laughter.)
what happens with the microchip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses where there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then there's a walk? what do you do with that?
but it is under the heading procedure, court procedure, right?
and that's where  that's what the waiver consists of. to say he didn't have an appeal of right, no. that's  he had an appeal of right up until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what  and that's what the judge is asking.
i don't understand 
that is my point. and there's nothing inadvertent here 
that's right. they would say that, and  and the  and where  where the parties came at loggerheads here was  their position is medical claim is in here. it's in this pot. that's not in dispute. it's in here. how much do you get? do you get the amount that we unilaterally designate, or can the state have a default rule that says when you cut us out and we no longer have a means of litigating in cooperation with you to make a reasoned judgment as to what the fair medical payment is in this settlement, can we insist upon 100 percent? otherwise, there's two things happening. the  the beneficiary should not be better off for having cut the state out of the process, but that's what's going to happen.
mr. van amberg, you have three minutes remaining.
actually, our position is more detective johns' actions rather than  the passage of time was a factor, but the more significant 
well, i actually argued and i do believe that it shouldn't require a coa. and the reason is because  part of the reason is because this case began before slack v. mcdaniel and continued after. and i think that's where judge tjoflat's opinion came from. how can someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get a coa? it's impossible because there's never going to be a constitutional issue. by virtue of the procedural ruling, the constitutional was not addressed. and judge tjoflat continued that dissenting position through the en banc decision, and i share the view that it is virtually impossible, if not completely impossible, in the typical case of a procedural resolution of the case, to ever get a coa. in this case, majority would point to the fact the my client did receive a certificate of appealability, but i don't think there are many others who will every get it because the question presented was, is a rule 60(b) still viable post aedpa? and that question won't recur, certainly not after the court rules here. and i think the very genuine concern that judge tjoflat had was and that he  that he articulated is it's virtually impossible to get appellate review. one of the things we know about habeas corpus is 
their argument is that, although he can raise it, the rights, however they may be derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to admit the police  in effect, thwarting his expectations. your argument, as i understand it, is that when the police search with that kind of permission, over his objection, it's not a reasonable search. isn't that the way to structure the issue?
excuse me. i  i thought the question presented  i didn't think. i'm reading it from the petition for writ of certiorari. in the absence of a contractual relationship with the defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant to 42 u.s.c., section 1981? so, i mean, the question presented was  was precisely if your client did not have a contractual relationship, would the mere allegation of personal injury, which you're now alleging, be enough to confer standing?
well, congress didn't specify, one way or another. and what i would  i would point you to the house report, because i think it actually is indicative, because when congress is framing the issue, they first look at the extent of the problem. and one of the ways they identify the problem as serious is, they point to overdoses that are taking place among teenagers. and then, in the next section of the report, they look at the question of the consequences of drug abuse. and what do they point to as 
 let me answer in two parts. first, of course, under the compelled-speech cases, the ability to protest the forced message is never a cure for compelled-speech violation, but 
yes.
you don't think there's even an arguable basis for saying we resolved the statutory question that's presented now, do you?
no, but i'm responding to the suggestion that there should be some kind of presumption that they would, would decline to authorize this. that's  the question you raised, mr. chief justice, is exactly the question before the court, whether the state can, constitutionally can insist that the union obtain affirmative authorization for this particular type of speech and for no other type of speech. let me  let me suggest 
the board here was trying to distribute, sort out seats that were available at these popular schools; and so it devised a system whereby every student had the opportunity to be assigned to at least one of those popular schools; and as far as the record shows in plaintiffs' briefing, there's no material differences between those  those popular schools.
no, no. i have gotten  i've finished considering it for future dangerousness. no, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous. now i say to myself, can i consider it for the purpose of showing a bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like? can i consider it for that purpose? what's the answer under state law?
well, they're not representing any named defendants. the  the problem is that as the statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive any further funding for 
well, justice scalia, of course, we didn't have telephone technology, so 
oh, no. it's the question of the rule. i haven't seen anything on your side that would advocate a rule that would not prevent the many, many, many, i believe  i am not an expert  ambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being investigated by the policeman. and maybe you can tell me you've looked into it empirically and i'm wrong, and that's why i'm bringing it up.
and so  but  but colorado has made a  a very clear commitment to the special master and does so to this court that if arbitration is proposed, colorado would participate. we do not as a state find it very acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to litigate these issues. after all, we have farmers. kansas has farmers. we need to get back to getting the water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism. that is our proposal. it was 
well, i would say that the  that if the  this court's prior decisions have any consistent meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers. the taxpayer here is the distributor. the statute says so. the way the statute works 
did the oregon courts take the position that, in the sentencing phase, the "deliberately" requirement must be judged just by what was in  introduced in the guilt phase?
of course, one  one of the objections in  in atkins was we needed a bright line test. we'd have difficulty determining which ones are mentally retarded. here we don't have that problem at all. i guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant is over or under 18.
i don't understand that. i mean, now you're backing away from your concession. if you have a lawful joint venture that's marketing a product, the joint venture has to be able to set the price of the product.
how is it not correct? that's what i'm 
wouldn't you like to have a 2- hour time limit? [laughter.]
is future dangerousness an issue in missouri?
may  may i ask you sort of a 7 general background question? as i understand your basic 8 position, if the defendant lets things sit for too long, 9 he loses the right to challenge the state conviction. on 10 the  and  and what's  what's at stake is an 11 enhancement based on the  on the prior conviction. is 12 there ever a time when the federal government loses the 13 right to use a very old conviction for enhancement 14 purposes?
well, your honor, i  i don't think you have to be an expert on contract law. i think that this court already held in patterson, for instance, that section 1981 was designed to have its own federal content, but that when we look at the term, the right to make and enforce contracts, certainly we have to interpret that in light of common law rules. and under the common law of contracts, only parties and third party beneficiaries have  hold rights under those contracts. under section 302 of the restatement, it defines who a third party beneficiary is, and i think that's a good starting place. it shows us that children, you know, as in this court's case in runyon, are third party beneficiaries. union members are third party beneficiaries of collective bargaining agreements under that  under the comments in the restatement. but the plaintiff acknowledges that the shareholders and employees are not intended third party beneficiaries of the contract.
as an abstract general matter divorced from the facts of this case and divorced from california law, we agree that aiding and abetting liability is part of a generic definition of any crime, including the theft offense here. however, that's not what the ninth circuit stated in either this case or in penuliar. in penuliar the ninth circuit stressed the extremely broad nature of california's aiding and abetting liability. it cited a case, people v. beeman, which refers to the specific natural and probable consequences doctrine under california law. so the ninth circuit was talking about the broad sweep of aiding and abetting liability under california law.
it's so silly to say that kansas can circumscribe the moral judgment of the  of the jury by saying, "you can take into account 18 aggravators, or else only two aggravators." that is a  you know, a significant control on their moral judgment. but then to say that kansas cannot circumscribe their moral judgment to the very limited degree of saying, "unless you find that the mitigators outweigh the aggravators, the proper response is the death penalty."
doesn't the 
is  is 
well, i don't think you need to stretch the language, justice scalia.
yeah, but suppose you lose  see, i'm thinking, suppose you lose in the texas proceeding, it comes here, and, for whatever reason, suppose you lost again  you might not, but you might  in which case, then what do we do?
right.
all right. so, then the case 24 really turns on the extent to which the government can  sorry, 25 the extent to which congress can waive sovereign immunity, as they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the constitution permits them to do what they did in (a).
aren't those cases in which the first judgment is complete, he simply does not attack everything that was a predicate for the first judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial, and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment was not complete.
except i  i don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment. i think we look to the facts that he had  that had come to his attention which caused him to believe that this was a family reenactment. i mean, you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something else. the facts are  are what matter and not 
well, justice stevens, if we take into account the full effect language that gets quoted in penry ii, we might well have a different result. but that wasn't the standard at the time and under aedpa 
well, justice ginsburg, as the real estate roundtable brief demonstrates, and is unrebutted, the real-estate industry operates through many very complicated structures for perfectly legitimate finance and tax-related reasons. and mr. franzen is a partner in some deals, but the testimony that was provided in a declaration  and it is appended to our reply brief  demonstrates that mr. franzen was not a partner in any deal that had anything to do with the westfield village apartments. but what the court of appeals did was, it erected a burden of proof that said that the defendant has to prove a negative, that there is not some affiliate corporation out there that is a citizen of the commonwealth that would be existing to destroy diversity. and that type of burden, to prove a negative, has never been authorized in this court's cases. rather, what this court's cases have held is that, as the masters of their complaint, plaintiffs have an opportunity to plead whichever defendants they want to try to prove their allegations against. if they want to try to prove federal claims, this court has held that that kind of case can be removed. if it wants to plead around federal claims, this court's cases have said that that would be respected, as well.
yes, but does that mean the  the judgment  the order denying release on parole is invalid? there are really two parts to it. one, you  we're not going to release you. secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want. insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing  the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?
well, we have said it repeatedly in contexts different from this. i mean, the paradigm context in which we made remarks to that effect, stated that, are affirmative action cases. the point of the affirmative action case is that some criterion which otherwise would be the appropriate criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial mix criterion. that is not what is happening here. this is not an affirmative action case. so why should the statements that have been made in these entirely different contexts necessarily decide this case?
well, if there were an authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished, we would not need the river master. but i don't 
that's correct, your honor. that's why it was appropriate for the seventh circuit to remand the case to the district court, because if the court were to conclude that an injunction is not appropriate, then anything that would be said about the meaning of the hobbs act or about civil rico would then just be an advisory opinion. and that's why this court, we believe, should also send the case back to the district court. but if it reaches the meaning of the hobbs act or civil rico, we believe that this is a situation there the plain meaning of the statute clearly controls.
i think it's less complicated than that, your honor. i think that it 
 position?
but are you  are you asking us to say that while the sentence is still under review, there can be no habeas petition filing?
even if the whole purpose was to drive it out of business?
but  but the  the mode of analysis of the court  it starts with the introduction to the court's opinion, and this is at page 682. it says  of  of zadvydas. we deal here with aliens who are admitted, aliens who have not yet 
thank you, mr. moran. mr. casey, you have 3 minutes left.
and you  you concede that there was error in execution here? you concede that there was a violation because  technically because there was no knock?
always? do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? no restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if  et cetera. i mean, how  how far do you want to push that principle?
ineffective assistance 
well, but our opinion didn't say it was just post-'85 damages. our  our opinion didn't  didn't answer the question, and  and the reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it because nobody even  nobody argued it at that time.
i would submit that there's a fundamental difference between the circumstances you've described and a school system which takes all comers and is tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a pluralistic society.
your honor, i think what is quite clear from all the briefs is that once a minor arrives in the emergency room, it is too late for her to go to court. there is, as we said, every minute is critical and any delay from the time that the doctor faces a pregnant teen, determines that she must have an immediate abortion, any delay from that point forward puts the minor's health at risk.
this is not part of a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue altogether, is it?
they're isolated. there's no nexus. the  the notion in swancc of a significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but it's not going to be significant enough. we didn't just say any nexus. it said significant nexus. so what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test that we articulated in swancc?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
but in here it  you agree that the california court has as much authority to say what federal law is as the ninth circuit, right? they are on a par. ninth circuit decisions in no way binds the supreme court of california. isn't that so?
i believe that's correct.
well, i'm not asking about certain cases. i just want to know analytically how you do it or how you think we're supposed to do it.
 force?
 makes it more realistic. all right, now, does it suddenly become constitutional?
can't you ask for a bill of particulars?
but the challenge here isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you can require everybody in the area to go through the one facility and pay a tipping fee.
it's pretty flabby. potentially meritorious? not probably, potentially.
i certainly don't want to be disagreeing with judge posner. so i  (laughter.)
yes, yes.
 and an adjudication. i mean, you know 
with respect, what i'm telling you is that congress has determined in that some areas it may be important to have a broader provision protecting against intimidation and coercion. i mean, if the court interprets discriminate against to include all that kind of conduct, then it renders those provisions redundant.
that's  that's absolutely it. he cannot  by winning his case, he's not going to shorten his sentence in any way. and that's  that's a big distinction from the balisok case where there was an automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence 
there was an argument that was made in your brief, and i didn't fully grasp the thrust of it, in the  that is, you said that the mine safety and health administration has a duty to the secretary of labor, but not to the mine operator and not to the miner. if that were true, then would there be  you wouldn't even get to the good samaritan doctrine, would you, if the only duty is to the secretary of labor?
isn't there  isn't that a big leap? i mean, even if we agree with you that there are federal rights and duties, is it irrational for congress to determine, since they arise in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to assume they're going to be brought in state court? the cause of action is for breach of contract that every state recognizes.
but i take it you would agree that, in effect, all you need to win on the statutory argument is for us to accept the premise that congress may very well have intended to interfere with the practice of medicine and to authorize the attorney general to do it, insofar as the practice of medicine would have gutted the statute  e.g., doctors who prescribe recreational drugs, doctors who, in effect, cater to pushers  but that congress did not intend to go any further than that in authorizing interference with the practice of medicine. i take it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that would be sufficient for you in this case.
there have been instances in the case law where people on supervised release have been extradited back from foreign countries based on violations of their supervised release. but the point is, under the statutory scheme, mr. toledo-flores is still subject to the district court's jurisdiction. the district court retains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release, to change the conditions, or to cut the supervised release. if the district court learns of a violation and a violation warrant is filed within the supervised-release period then the supervised-release period is effectively tolled and the district court 
what's your authority for that? i have the same question as the chief justice. i was looking at your brief for the strongest case. suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of coastline. would he have the same standing that you do or do you have some special standing as a state, and if so what is the case which would demonstrate that?
so there's no standing to challenge a presidential directive which says we are going to buy bagels for all evangelistic christian breakfasts. (laughter.)
no, it's not on the contributions, but it is going back to the court on issues of transfers of money from national parties to state parties and on whether related or coordinated expenditures are, indeed, allowed to be an expenditure. so the case is going back to the trial court on those bases anyway.
 may not be true. but focus on the particular question. if you have one state that allows the use of a drug that the federal government has determined is illegal, and is illegal everywhere else because other states haven't done it, how is the federal government supposed to enforce that prohibition?
well, did  do you understand the trial court to have taken the position that even though the knock would probably have been futile, the police were required to  to make it anyway, to knock anyway?
this, the position we're taking here is fully consistent with oneida ii. in oneida ii, this court held that there was a violation of federal common law principally because of a violation of the nonintercourse  indian trade and intercourse act in 1795. this court wasn't asked to deal with, at that time, with the treaty of fort schuyler. it wasn't asked to deal with the treaty of buffalo creek. it wasn't presented with evidence of the numerous authorized new york state treaties in 1840 through 1846 that diminished this reservation, that the state of new york will deal with  with as amicus 
 but would have been well beyond the offset. and the fact 
 other than whether we meet our burden of proving he is insane, by clear and convincing evidence.
i thought all it did was shift the burden of production to the defendant. it doesn't  the showing at stage one doesn't involve the burden of persuasion.
still, it  it  you know, we usually talk about person can mean a corporation. this says individual. a person is defined in  in sub (3) just above it. a person includes any individual or entity. then the next thing says individual. so it's not a  it doesn't sound like a corporation.
no?
yes, but you didn't even give their phone numbers.
that's right, your honor. yes. on  justice breyer, on your reading, a  a court could sit indefinitely with the competency proceeding under advisement.
your honor, this  this provision was enacted in response to a specific problem that's illustrated by the barcellos & wolfsen litigation. individual farmers sued an irrigation district. the irrigation district was concerned that it might be subject to inconsistent liability to the farmers on the one hand and the federal government on the other, and it sought to join the united states. there was no mechanism in 1978 for that type of suit. congress acted 
sony itself had a trial 
but thermtron was such a far cry from this case. in thermtron the district judge said yes, i have jurisdiction but i'm just too busy, so i'm going to toss this case back to the state court.
no. i was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because i don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the d.c. circuit.
no. but let me tell you, it's still a very important statute because  for the reason that i framed before, and that is, most cases that are adea disparate impact cases are not cost cases. there are other tests: applications procedures, strength tests, and the like. that's what the eeoc believes is still very essential. so while we don't impose a big burden on employers in the cost context for the reasons that you and justice stevens have been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is somehow worthless. the eeoc has said that the disparate impact plays a, quote/unquote, vital role under the adea and that the respondents' position would greatly weaken the statute because 
and some of those cases are brought against the police officers. but, the reasons that would suggest a certain accrual date for the fifth amendment claim are very different from the reasons that dictate the accrual of the fourth amendment claim at the time  the only action the petitioner alleges violated the fourth amendment in this case was when his detention at the police station, which was consensual at the outset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some point before he confessed.
yes. but that would require a rather significant change in the court's article iii standing jurisprudence. it would, furthermore, allow the tail to wag the dog, the exception to swallow the rule. if anybody could bring any kind of a case at all, then all manner of cases of  with  for which the court had no jurisdiction at all could be along with them.
this  this applies only to operations that are both licensed and registered in michigan. is that so?
 competition with 
well, and how is that different from the forgery?
i  i think that that's one way of looking at it, justice stevens, but 
mr. lamken, have you had any second thoughts about your position that it's the order, rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?
correct.
right? we have elections, in part, because the only way  there's no way to protect every individual's right to have the government's collective policy suit his or her fancy. i mean, that way 
one of the problems i have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client.
so, you do 
well, justice souter, i think again, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to me, the claim preclusion is appropriately 
if you count an agent going on the land, there was an agent on the land, but what has happened with this land in terms of federal superintendence is that this land has been superintended, and supervised whether in tribal hands or otherwise, by the state of new york and local governments since 1788. there is a reference in our papers to a report, it was issued in connection with the new york state setting up their troopers to cover the reservations, and that report acknowledged that the united states government appreciated the fact that the state of new york had been keeping peace on the reservations with their police and saw no reason to interfere with over 100 years  and this was in the early 20th century  of over 100 years of state police supervision.
well, now, your  your opponents quote some language from the  one of the michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.
right.
well, our view is that the heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner is seeking relief that is indisputably available in habeas. our view is that the governing precedent and really the touchstone here is this court's decision in preiser v. rodriguez, which drew the distinction that the court has long recognized between claims challenging the conditions of a prisoner's confinement and claims challenging the fact or duration of that confinement. now, to be sure, that analogy is not exactly apt in the capital context. but we believe that where a prisoner identifies a permissible alternative, it is that which renders the claim 
denied counsel, and they were also dismissed at some point down the line?
yes. i don't understand how it's possible that congress says in the statute that you take the nsps trigger  remember, this is not just some random definition we're talking about. construction is the trigger for this part of this entire regulatory scheme, and modification is the trigger, and say it is official as defined in, and they did it twice.
i'm talking about the findings. is there a single word in the findings that refers to a viable fetus? it maybe refers to a nonviable fetus.
was there  maybe i'm wrong about this, but i thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.
there may be under state law, it's not clear why that would raise a federal issue.
thank you very much. the case is submitted.
what  what do you say to ms. perales' argument that the  the numbers are just too precise to have been reflective of anything but a racial motivation, and that, therefore, the  the district court's finding was clearly erroneous?
the  the sole reason claimed for jurisdiction at the agency hearing was adjacency to this non-navigable, unnamed ditch, which was dug by the county for a sewer system. that's the sole reason. the same argument appeared at the district court level, adjacency to the unnamed, unnavigable ditch.
but, your honor, the jury did find, in special interrogatory 4(e), that there was violence and threats of violence and in final interrogatory 8 that it was to obstruct interstate commerce. also here, remember the judge held a separate hearing after the jury verdict, before issuing injunction. and if, on the basis of the evidence that he heard during the trial and that special hearing, he found four acts of violence and threats of violence, he then has to decide what injunctive relief is appropriate. and, of course, he would also, consistent 
but i'm not saying a treaty. i'm saying there's a letter and wouldn't it be the case that the judge would have to say, here, mr. sheriff, you take the letter and you hand it to the counsel? it's his property.
the seventh circuit did everything it could to make it seem like a plausible issue, as opposed to a very clear issue that should be resolved in our favor. it went out of its way to do that.
well, that 
sure.
see, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if england did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help france get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation. of course, it would have been legal, either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in derogation, for that reason.
they have a high class of felons in the federal prison basically.
it seems to me that then there are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would have  he should have gotten an instruction on both.
now from a constitutional standpoint the fourth amendment doesn't protect other people. it protects those who have been seized. and that's, that's the framework we are dealing with here today.
i said that the call was initiated by the victim. it wasn't a  a police officer coming to interview her.
i think twice you started something and our questions impeded you. but i think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you  you were saying just as the  the federal authority can't come in and nullify the state criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination. and  and i thought that the comparison between a  a sentence  a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination  you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.
scott 
no.
and i'm just wondering if he's  just raises a doubt as  so there's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he was killing was either a human being or an  a kind of individual that it would be wrong to kill.
yes, with the counties, perhaps. but another issue with the presentence report is it doesn't deal with in-prison behavior, and that's what the prison officials need a  need time to take a look at, is how the inmate is going to react once they get in the prison environment, which is a wholly different environment than a jail environment.
no. it doesn't  it doesn't purport it. and in fact, in this particular case 
 of course 
your honor, we disagree with that, because of the structure of the act. again, it makes no sense to be equal partners at the table, and, once you reach an impasse, to say, well, you're going to presume one side is right.
yes, your honor, but that's the same constraint that this court found not above the constitution in booker.
do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?
well, what about the hypothetical? are you suggesting that in a situation like that  -we'll talk about whether the facts comport with it later  but in a situation like that, he's not entitled to share in the recovery that the government eventually receives?
but it says, "both parties believe there are no disputed issues of fact material to defendant's liability."
fifty-fifty.
we do not agree as to the evidence in this case. we have evidence in this case that we cited to in our brief that when you adjust, as against the longview mill which our client was literally right next door to, when you adjust for the fact that weyerhaeuser supplied half of the raw material needs of the longview mill at way below market transfer prices, when you adjust those to the average price they paid other third parties for logs, the longview mill ran at a loss for a significant part of the, of the predation period. we do have the evidence in this case to contend 
and 
on  on this record, yes, given all the other reasons we have given by the prosecutor.
that would be 
 which is common. so if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the court used in clearfield trust, in kimbell foods, and really look to the nature of the contract? whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the united states in that they are going to get the money. we have a statute. we have all those things i just listed. it covers only federal employees. should  there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the nation, et cetera, et cetera. so what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference? i concede that one. the title is not united states. it's blue cross blue shield or whatever.
accept the hypothetical.
and so your general rule to accomplish your objective would be?
but your expectation  this is what i'm trying to get at  your expectation is not what governs. you concede, as i understand it, that he still had an expectation, in the sense that he could assert a right of privacy, he can litigate this case, he has standing 
yes. if that  but the funds that are raised are public monies. they don't go in  they're not deposited in the treasury. but in the joint appendix, there is a reproduced  an ams, agricultural marketing service, circular that explains how these public monies  and calls them "public monies"  are to be disposed of. and it describes the beef board, this governmental body that receives the money, as being the custodian for the agricultural marketing service and handling these monies. and congress and the secretary have imposed strict limitations on how those funds can be deposited. so whether they go into the general treasury or whether they're handled in this way is really a matter of fiscal and revenue and internal governmental policy that i don't think that 
well, it depends on how the courts would construe the slusa cases as affecting the "in connection with purchase or sale" in the sec enforcement authority. if you were to accept the premise that the court's zandford and o'hagan decisions are binding on the slusa preemption language, anytime a court is construing  may i finish, mr. chief justice?
i believe those are the same principles, your honor.
the  he's trying to figure out when the  the final clause of 4(a) talks about commencement  he want to know when it commences. does it commence when you get in line or when you 
again, those are all facts 
he waived the right to have a  to have what is called in michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument. so what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.
that's a crime 
it's cheaper. it's cheaper too. (laughter.)
i  i don't think 
no. before the hearing starts, he gets 48 hours notice, but is he  is he just told there's going to be a hearing in 48 hours and that's it?
and  i'm sorry.
well, do you  do you defend the injunction in its entirety?
no, absolutely not, your honor. the research-tool question  let me begin by saying, these were not research tools; these rgd peptides were the objects of study.
but we didn't bring cert on that question.
but the court also said in allen against wright, you know, the absence of precise standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying the law of standing. standing isn't an area, really, that is susceptible to precise definitions. it seems to me that both because of the incidental test and the concerns that justice kennedy articulated, if someone's claim is that people in the white house have five meets in the course of a year that they're upset about, it does not take much at the jurisdictional 
it  it does seems strange to me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as-applied challenges.
no question, your honor.
and you're saying that inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts that they have alleged.
but could you start simply with the factual predicate for your argument and his argument. you seem to be starting from, if i understand the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from basically different factual assumptions. could you, could you start by commenting on that?
it is, justice souter, but what  my argument is that that language, properly joined and served, simply tracks the civil-action requirement under the original diversity statute, as well as the removal provision of 1441(a). but what the court 
and presumably, if there is a conviction and a sentence, you could come back here again by way of a cross appeal.
we're not 
held discriminatory against interstate commerce. could  under your view, could your city require all milk be pasteurized within your city at a government owned, city owned facility?
 making this argument that it's inherently prejudicial even though the jury couldn't see it?
because there are vehicle collisions every day, your honor, that do not end in death or serious bodily harm.
ms. millett.
that's correct.
because, your honor, it's whether the words "offering telecommunications" are ambiguous. if i  if i bake cakes, and someone was to say, "if you offer cakes, you don't offer butter," there's nothing in the english language, justice scalia, that makes that unreasonable, that a person who offers cakes to the public does not offer butter to the public. and if you believe that example is correct, then you have to uphold the fcc, because what it says is, the offer of the final product is not offering, to the public, the ingredient.
well, it would be like in any of those cases where you have a  a broad prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid on its face. and then someone comes in and says, well, my situation is one where it's unconstitutional. we've never said, well, it's too bad because it's valid on its face, have we?
i understand. can i take you to their, the federal circuit's answer? it's two pages before the quote that i just gave you, page 19, there's another blocked quote. the federal circuit has explained what it's talking about when it means a motivation. they say that they have repeatedly held that there is an implicit motivation to combine. it exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior art as a whole, that's a teaching, but when the improvement is technology independent and the combination of references results in a product or process. and these are common motivations. you would do it because it's more desirable because it's stronger, cheaper, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, more efficient.
 good would the  what good would the presumption do if it's just a presumption? presumably, if it's a presumption, the prisoner is 
so you're saying  and i  i don't mean to disagree with you. you're saying, yes, there are going to be a few tough results under this definition.
i was  i was trying to answer justice scalia's question. but let me say this. and of course i would read the language of the commentary and the incb and the opinion of our former ambassador, herbert okun, in brazil and france. but let me also say, if i may, that the position of the executive, until this  until this litigation, has been the same. and the reason we know that is precisely what you said, your honor. mescaline is also covered by the treaty. peyote is not. the native 
i think that's right, justice souter. i think i agree with that.
it was not a defined job within the collective bargaining agreement.
and you think that's not fuzzy. (laughter.)
no. a state absolutely cannot impose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.
there were decisions going the other way.
it's going be a different criterion  you  you say it's going to be different for the first amendment and the  and  and the equal protection clause, at least where race is involved. what if there's no constitutional violation at all, but i just selectively prosecute him just because i don't like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of mine?
 the text of the twenty-first amendment  the text of the twenty-first amendment gives states the right to control imports. the history of the twenty-first amendment in the webb-kenyon act clearly demonstrate  the purpose of the webb-kenyon act was to eliminate alcohol shipments from 
well, that's 
do you mean start and stop with a different intent?
i mean, if  if you're abandoning it 
no. they're going to say, well, we can imagine a reason, but if you look at it realistically, you know there's no good reason.
well, i  i  i think in, in this court's decisions dealing with public schools, this court has, has a consistent theme as to give deference to the judgments by the educators. public schools 
mr. radmore, i don't think you're quite correct when you say, with regard to an automobile accident, it's just like a private entity delivering mail  or delivering packages. if a private delivery service had an automobile accident that resulted in the destroy  destruction of a package, a private party could sue for the contents of the package. but that's not true with regard to the postal service.
rule 41(b) specifically deals with the 7-day period of  of time for issuance following the expiration of the time for a petition for rehearing or the disposition of that petition for rehearing.
correct, though you're alone on that because even the government doesn't and nor does the criminal justice. but if you're prepared to defend them, i guess you'd say why is it that they will allow (b)(3), fraud on the court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your own witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud for whatever set of reasons, you can't.
 had been inferred 
does it sound good or bad to you now? (laughter.)
the case is submitted.
i think that the question of whether an error can be deemed harmless is always a federal question. chapman says as much.
well, under utah law, an assault is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to  with an intent to do bodily injury. now, pushing  there's not that there. now, one of the chief problems or primary problems with the utah court's decision in this case is it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose between roles, to choose whether or not they are going to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law enforcement officials. well, the reality  first of all, it's  it's very difficult for officers to try to make those kind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this is precisely the kind of a  the kind of case where that would be impossible to achieve because officers in this case are acting clearly under both roles. they're stopping crime and they are also protecting others from harm. we want officers to rescue people from harm when they have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until you have to call an emt. that's what mincey provides. and if there are no further questions, i would reserve the remainder of my time.
 you're saying.
well, that expert opinion is that, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.
we do not believe there is a contract and we do not believe we have to rely on it. we were  the does were coerced into what they did. they do not seek compensation.
your  justice souter, a state  a state could do that if it changed the designated uses for its rivers. but in the state of maine, as in 45 states 
well, how about during the interrogation?
well, i think foremost, your honor, is that that provision came about prior to the booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory. and what that addresses and what it was meant to address was if the court were to depart, then it was  it needed to explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the sentencing commission to take that information into account in revising the guidelines. that is still a purpose with the sentencing commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still use that information. but it  at the very least, we need information from the sentencing judge about each of the matters that he or she 
not after, not after they have already given away  i mean, yes; they could come to him anew and say i'll tell you what, if you give us this easement we'll give you yet another one.
but  but the court has 
 we didn't decide it on the basis that president reagan says, "this is what in particular the agreement affected." we examined it for ourselves.
well, could  could you be concrete? i mean, there  i don't know what you mean. what are the issues? can you give me an explicit example?
 intent was not to deliver anthrax.
they do. that  that's 
you set off the district court and the court of appeals but you don't think the district court got it right, either. you said the district court required something more.
it's no, under our precedent.
 a horrible mess for the district court. it would not work because 
isn't there a bit of  there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?
it is. it doesn't say anything expressly about either of those things, but i think it has long been 
 your honor.
okay.
 officers are reasonable in time, place 
the prosecutor is not a defendant, your honor.
 out to work, comes back at the end of the day, and is checked in.
your honor, as dale points out, it's up to the private institution to decide what its metrics 
no, your honor. epa has a lot of room to move based both on the endangerment standard itself and on background principles of administrative law.
well, prima paint did, though, involve what we would characterize as a voidable contract.
excuse me. why didn't it? i  why wasn't the apa applicable?
well, in this case the inmate put forth no experts of any kind. there was an opportunity for the inmate to rebut the evidence put forth by the prison officials, and  and there was no evidence submitted. so in this case he didn't 
 2:10 a.m. to 4:20 is in the guilt phase of the trial. and again from the colloquy, "if you're not there, that is certainly mitigating." and let me just mention, in terms of the timing of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibi covered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the morning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til 4:20. the crimes occurred in the early morning hours. and so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say that the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in some small piece, on deliberateness. to the extent that the state puts on additional evidence to establish deliberateness, of course defendant can respond to that additional evidence, but the state doesn't make the question of whether the defendant was there wide open again in the penalty phase.
 at the time this statute was passed to deal with lax state treatment of opium, was opium regulated as part of medical practice in any of the states?
okay.
well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of  of the named party. so, i  i assume that mr. cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.
 to infer anything.
well no, he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad  a broader range when there was no decision on all fours.
no, your honor. it is 
mr. phillips, i want to be sure i understand your position. are you saying the statutory text in effect says every regulation using the word modification must employ the same definition, or are you relying on a general principle that when the same word is used it should be used in the same way?
what if the judge had said that?
i was going to say that. what 18  what  excuse me.
and you're suggesting 
it is, of course, possible, justice o'connor, that this court could do that.
i don't know what $50 limit you are talking 
from your answer, i take it 15 then you would agree with judge black in the eleventh 16 circuit that equitable tolling would apply. he goes to 17 state court within the year after his federal conviction 18 becomes final. the state court is sitting on it for 2 19 years. the limitation, i take it from what you said, 20 would be tolled during that time.
thank you, mr. savrin. mr. garre?
mr. gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and  and the feasibility of going that route?
counsel, i was 
no. well, obviously, it's  it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.
well, the  the plan contains an allocation agreement that is part of  the allocation agreement is enforceable. every court of appeals that has  has ruled on this issue has said that they are  that they are not going to adopt state court rules that contradict plan terms because that would be contrary to the intent of congress in enacting erisa and in making plan sponsors the  the governors of plan design. so we didn't want that type of thing to happen. every court of appeals has ruled that. but that  that 
well, i can understand that you could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied challenge, but to look at this form and tell us it is facially invalid is difficult for me to understand. if  if there are specific incidents where something was defective, then challenge it, but what's the matter with the form?
we believe that, as the cosponsor said, on november 15th when they introduce the final version of the language, that all of those cases are grandfathered with respect to the h(1) effective-date provision and the e(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision. however, that still leaves in place the government's main argument in the d.c. circuit below, which is that the e(2) provision governing csrt and final decisions, and the h(2) provision governing final decisions of military  final decisions of csrts, truncates all of the review that is currently in the d.c. circuit. so, it's certainly plausible  it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course, presented in this case, to read the dta as truncating the vast majority of claims at guantanamo in current pending cases. of course, that isn't the issue before you here. the issue before you here is simply the hamdan case, and there was  and there was a strong  the strong desire by the congress not to interfere with this court's traditionally exercised jurisdiction.
would you, would you, as representative of the insurers, would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases?
not the joint venture doing that.
well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us. we're going to have to sort out which of these things are covered by state law and which aren't.
now, suppose you don't have the check. what's left?
your honor, i think that the court certainly could consider all of that; and  and if pressed by the government would need to consider that. but certainly at a minimum, the court needs to 
i want your answer.
district courts do that? i mean, they would be considering the same, the same issues we are, i suppose?
depending upon how broadly you think congress intends regulations to be sucked into the terms of this statute. i mean, your interpretation means sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.
"home-consumed" is feed it to your pig?
 that's so 
the single message is, "join the army."
and then if you would have succeeded, you would have been compensated.
 isn't 
of course, if we're  if  if admittedly, as justice breyer said, we're trying to figure out some way to make this work in circumstances in which it's  it's never going to work smoothly, i suppose one answer would be to take the government's position and say you've  your  your year runs from the moment the right is recognized, but to the  to the extent that there is a retroactivity question, a  a court should simply stay the proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether, particularly in  in second habeas where you have the  the second petition where you have the problem, to see whether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity or whether the  your circuit will recognize retroactivity. then if it does, then you can go forward.
it sure does make sense to me, though. surely it's the case that a company that does nothing but intrastate michigan business will, by and large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company which does interstate business but part of its business is intrastate michigan business. i  i just  it seems to me obvious that 
you mean a trial before all the  before they were about to be committed or the hearing at which it was determined whether they would be or not?
and that's a viewpoint-discriminatory message.
is it  is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?
in 2(a) 
this is what i would say about it.
no, but the  number 14 clearly is not mitigating.
well, no. i think that ignores how statute of limitations are actually construed by courts. you can write a statute basically two ways. you can put the violation as the trigger or you can put the act, alleged to be a violation. courts apply those identically. and for instance, if you have a summary judgment motion by a qui tam  qui tam defendant, which we always agree that this statute (b)(1) applies, all the defendant has to do is point out the act alleged to be a false claim falls outside of the 6-year period, and he wins. he doesn't have  no one has to show whether the actual claim itself was false or not. so i think, you know, as justice breyer points out, this is the way you universally construe statute of limitations. having the same trigger for all three 3730 actions means the limitations period starts for all three at the same time. this makes it easier for the whistleblower to bring both their qui tam and retaliation actions together. if she's forced to bring the retaliation action first, then if she misses that, then she's got no incentive to then go on and bring the qui tam action from the  the incentive from this whistleblower action, which is the key purpose of it. also, if she has to bring the  the retaliation action first before the qui tam action, then what will happen, if she's not ready to bring the qui tam action  these can be very complicated allegations, complicated defense contract  then what will happen is she will most likely have to split her claim. and that exposes the whistleblower to all kinds of  of pitfalls. for instance 
can i get back to the  the barnes case that justice scalia asked you about? is it a possible distinction of that case that that involved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other words, the lawyer's labors generated the  the asset, while in this case, the claim depends upon the  the contractual provision?
not later ascribe. i mean, casey was relying on 
he at least put in the evidence.
mr. phillips.
may i answer, your honor?
 would that  if you took the issue letter as the day, wouldn't all of the  all of the government's claims be timely? because we're only talking about part of the claim, anyway, as i understand it. is that correct?
the  the answer  the answer would be yes. where i believe 
in other words  discharge from a point source, what is  well, then epa concedes you win?
are 
is that what you're saying, then?
but  but read it. what does it say?
but your point is not that there was any prejudice here. your point is that he was entitled to a grand jury?
 themselves.
may i ask on the minimum punishment ploy? did that ever work in this case or did any of  of the trial judges ever grant a  a challenge for cause on the basis of the use of the minimum punishment ploy?
is the statute all you had?
does it refer to the  the bankrupt's employees or your employees?
no, it did not.
is there any constitutional protection? the sixteenth amendment refers to an income tax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly exceeds in many cases a person's income. that would be quite a far-out theory at the moment.
yes.
was there a curative instruction?
you get 
i think they do. and i sure hope they do, because this is a situation where congress and the federal government pervasively regulates the drug transactions at issue here in a way that even respondents don't object to. the details of the form that you fill out for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in writing, the regulations specify whether it has to be in pen or pencil  i mean, there's such a pervasive involvement of the federal government in the regulation of these controlled substances that i don't think there's any additional commerce clause extension by regulating the purpose for which the prescription is being made. that's what the dea did in the context of marinol, when it was first moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that  we discuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief. and i think that kind of regulation, although it's not a common feature of the dea in its administration of the controlled substances act, is an important one, is a legitimate one. and i guess what i would say, with respect to congress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a congress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned about suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the question of using federally controlled substances for the express purpose of inducing a lethal overdose.
well, again, the statute says that the debtor may convert except in certain circumstances. i think that the requirement of a motion to convert a case gives the court the procedural mechanism for looking at the case, seeing, making sure that the debtor 
so you would agree the analysis would be different if there could be an innocent cause of the alert as well as the contraband being the cause of the alert.
from the  from the point of view of a defendant who thinks i'm going to fight this case on the merits, but if i lose, i still have this ace up my sleeve.
wherever it is.
what about the states that do a allow shipment from out of state? they don't care about their 
thank you, general. mr. west.
are you conceding that the presumption makes no sense outside of the requirements metering context?
do you know another arrangement where the federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over? i know schemes that work the other way where the state goes first, and then the federal authority, but do you know another one?
 waiver. the state waived its immunity by participating through  in the 
we don't know basically what florida law is? i mean, is that the best answer?
 but i 
but based on that, your honor, then there would be no statute of limitations. if  if that decision came out 10 years from now, we would then be back in this court on a 60(b) motion, which i would submit is fundamentally inconsistent with what congress intended.
the curtilage is a unique concept, i guess in florida, in that the curtilage is the enclosed space around the house that has some kind of enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes. so if the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to the residence, that would actually be a burglary within the state of florida. in other states, it may not.
well, but 
you mean willfully alone?
the first part of the analysis is whether or not he initiates.
okay, i think you've hit what is the problem for us. when you use the word assay, you assume that that is excluding certain processes. and that's not clear to me. would you explain that in greater detail?
why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements? the ninth circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for purposes of the question that's presented to us. so why shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a chambers violation?
the average person could have brought a lawsuit, a person in a wheelchair, and said, "all the courthouses in this country, or in this county, are on the second floor, and moreover the bathrooms  i need a special bathroom," and they would have won without the ada. why did we need the ada, then?
 expectation, and i  i think, ultimately, that's irrelevant.
 domestic service?
 johns 
if we were 
ms. millett.
the shareholder can sue. the sole shareholder can sue. the corporation can sue. both have 1981 claims. it's not either/or.
i think the problem with the examples is that none of these are abuses. as i see it, the examples of the tape recording mailed in and the volunteer statement, i don't see how you can call those abuses.
well, he certainly understood that. he said if you want to give me the death penalty, bring it on, i'm ready for it. the purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the imposition of the death penalty. he says bring it on.
well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them. but we're trying to get this case right and, you know, i don't care what position they took before. i care about what the right answer is, and i find it difficult to believe that you can simply allege in a complaint, i was injured by the negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, period. does that satisfy the, the federal rules?
 not, then, just say "objectively reasonable basis to remove"? that's a one  one standard.
any  any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state post-conviction collateral review are granted? in other words, if we are talking about an additional six months in every case, how many of those are actually granted?
the state can pay my damages if it wishes. it just doesn't happen to have a statute to that effect right now. but i mean, that  surely, that doesn't  doesn't 
well, the two parties obviously don't compete within the terms of the joint venture, but they compete more generally.
yes, thank you, justice breyer.
but then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.
it does  it does do that. it's actually 
well, with respect, your honor, we think circumstances  it does not constitute fraud if there is no loss causation. at least it certainly doesn't constitute securities fraud under this statute, and if the complaint does not plead loss causation, it hasn't pled fraud. so we submit that 
no, justice scalia 
so you think relators can get part of the government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the government is ultimately giving money? you think they are still entitled to a piece of the pie?
that's correct. and in this 
i mean, my question, obviously, 12 is, is not the reason that you want to examine the 13 criminal record in the case that is being used 14 horrendously against your client is to find out both as to 15 what happened at the time and also the background that 16 would be relevant in respect to your client? for example, 17 alcohol abuse, which happened to be checked.
i think that that's true, your honor, although i'd like to read a quote from papastathis, which is  the court relied on. the quote is just this, "numerous cases have held that once a party gratuitously agrees to inspect and the third party is subsequently injured, that party can be held liable for its negligent inspection." there is a host of arizona case law on assumed duties. and the case i would refer to is martinez versus state, which is simply a case where a road washes out, and the government reroutes the road for a  for a period of time across a private land, and, for a period of time, grades it, and then stops grading it. and, in that circumstance, the government was held liable simply for having, for that period of the time, assumed a duty. and there wasn't an analysis in the martinez case of whether or not the elements of section 324(a) were met or not.
justice stevens, what i take, what i take from their analysis is a hostility towards attorneys' fees being allowed in bankruptcy. and perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys' fees to be allowed in bankruptcy. maybe we shouldn't allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy. maybe we shouldn't allow certain kinds of environmental claims to be allowed in bankruptcy. they don't like the rule, apparently, but their analysis of the history is wrong. and we cite innumerable cases and law review articles that demonstrate that the practice is as we say that it is. and policy reasons are no grounds to sort of create these federal common law rules or these categorical rules of preclusions.
correct.
yes.
and if you look at the  the job title, which is part of the joint appendix, forklift is not mentioned, and it was not part of that. but to answer your question specifically with respect to these facts, the  in this case here, she was discharged. if you look at the joint appendix, on rule 91(b)  and that's found at page 54 and 55 of  i'm sorry. 55 of the joint appendix. this is the rule under which she requested the, quote, investigation. by its very terms, it doesn't even apply until an employee is, quote, disciplined or, quote, dismissed. she was dismissed when she was removed from service. then she asked for a hearing under subpart (b), and she was given an investigation. this court, in its jurisprudence dealing with statute of limitations, said in the morgan case that an act of discrimination occurs when it happens. well, when she was happened  when this happened, she lost pay, she lost benefits. she was terminated. even  even their own witness, roadmaster brown, testified had she not asked for an appeal, she was terminated. so it was a discrete act at that time.
no. i'm  and as i said before, i think the political party should be the one that defines its integrity 
thank you, ms. millett. mr. rashkind, you have 4 minutes left.
yes.
any new miranda warning.
but isn't the standard of the fourth amendment a reasonableness standard, and isn't there something bizarre about saying reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?
i think that there's no other reading of what epa meant from the regulations. no one was confused by this, chief justice roberts. no one was confused. this argument, it's a new argument in this court about how to read the rules, the 30  52.01(d), 51.100, and 51.166(b)(8), all uncited below. it's really not plausible. the court would have to abandon a lot of very basic principles of how to interpret legal texts to read the rules this way, and i think judge poisner was right on that. he was right to say this is the natural reading of the rules.
 cases in which we have held a fact of  a finding of the fact of this kind was irrelevant, was harmless? i think the cases are all the other 
whatever.
because the prosecutor's statements cannot be construed in a vacuum. you have to look, as boyde required and as california did, at the context of the entire proceedings. what we're here  what the jury was doing in payton was deciding whether payton should live or die, the sentencing determination.
i understand.
would he have to sue on the first one right away?
justice stevens, it should not figure in at all because he still had a statutory right to redeem the property, and once he had that statutory right to redeem the property, due process 
 that we must tolerate no matter how unwise it is.
well, you started out by saying that the purpose of the confrontation clause was to keep out the accusations made out of court, but i would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay rule. and if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule, how does the confrontation clause differ?
the mother's testimony about the time from 
are  are web sites and chat rooms covered by the mccain-feingold?
what is it that tells us that? i just happened to read an affidavit where the  the person says that he won't enter until this package is there, but there are a lot of cause i would think 
no, your honor.
we wanted a declaration from the court that the  that they cannot proceed with a statute that takes our rents without paying  paying for us. what's happened here is that this legislature has enacted 
 elements, directed verdict. if you're right 
i'm sorry, your honor, on page 3-a of petitioner's brief in the appendix. it states, "the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence." and that's what we contend requires the district court to explain the facts that the court is relying on to impose the particular sentence in the case.
what does the word holistic mean? (laughter.)
that's not the argument that we made in this court. that is an argument that we made in the lower courts. the argument that we're making in this court is rather that under the england case  or rather, the rationale of the england case, there shouldn't be any issue preclusion whether or not the state courts made any factual findings. i don't think that the question as framed by your honor is presented by the briefs. i mean, obviously, that was a contention of ours. we think that's a correct statement of how the case should have been resolved by the ninth circuit, but the ninth circuit instead chose not to look at that issue or not to decide the case on that issue, but instead to decide under its prior precedents of dodd and palomar, that issue preclusion applied and then applied its own formulation of the equivalent 
intent to make a false statement?
your honor  and i was referring to that sentence, and perhaps i wasn't clear, but i would  i would say that they are still talking about rule 4. but even if they're not talking about rule 4, even if, in fact, this court believes that the district  that the circuit court's analysis is flawed, then we must keep in mind that this court is reviewing judgments, not opinions. and this court could easily do what it did in gonzalez, which is, even though the analysis is not consistent with what this court  i mean, frankly, if the court takes that view with what we're asking the court to do here  but you can nevertheless affirm the judgment. because the district court did, in fact, get it right. the 
right.
sure. and 
and plaintiffs, generally, like to sue  sue solvent defendants too i think. (laughter.)
i mean, wouldn't all of your  all of your objections apply equally?
mr. dreeben.
 when people commit torts.
but the traditional rule is to interpret the jury's verdict in a way that's most favorable to its conclusion. and so, here what the judge has to decide is, based on the record, were there four acts of violence or threats of violence to obstruct interstate commerce? and we'd suggest it would be quite easy for the judge to identify four such acts.
well, i  i think  i think the record here reinforces your honor's view on 
and it's 
 in oregon's experience, we have a small number of people, most of whom consume the drug. the amounts that are left over, even if this law spread nationwide, would not be significant.
it  it is. for example, the respondents give the example of promotion decisions but we think that there are analytical and well as practical and historical distinctions that congress, that led congress to treat pay differently. as a practical matter, while it's always the case or almost always the case that somebody knows they have been subject to disparate treatment in a promotion case  they know that they didn't get the promotion and somebody else did  -it is frequently possible for an employee to be subject to disparate pay without ever knowing that she has been treated differently than anybody else. and certainly 
when you 
yes. again, that's why i don't think there's any one single rule that governs all cases. this, this i think falls under the frazier standard, where the court said that, that schools have a duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare students for citizenship, and not violating the law is an important part of that and teachers' act in loco parentis. they act as guardians and they should be able to do, as this court says in earls, what a reasonable guardian would do. that would mean don't allow people to encourage lawbreaking.
are you saying that this has a purpose other than barring stable  stale claims? it's simply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to allow other federal programs to proceed and  i'm looking for some way for you to describe (e) as being something other than a limitations provision.
 internally.
do we have the complaint in 
yes.
well, i'm trying to think of what brandeis could have been thinking.
that's why you have counsel there, to help the court when the court makes a real boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say, one would have expected some objection from defense counsel.
they can certainly make that allegation, but the employer is left open to avail itself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a very easy time of showing that there's been undue delay.
and therefore, if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park, and it's the only part of the park that brings them into the park, and it's the only part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, that's the park. just as if i were to sell my house and i list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen is an essential part of the house.
isn't that just a word game? it's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction from one court to the other. why should that be  why does that make it jurisdictional?
 nothing else before the dta, congress has now spoken, and congress has made it clear that, whatever else is true, these military commission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review can be done after the fact, after conviction, in the d.c. circuit.
would you want us to hold that, you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion that says what california's sentencing judges may do under california law, as you've described it to us, is that they  they may exceed the middle range whenever they think that that is a better result, whenever they think that that's reasonable?
does this make your case easier, in a sense, or 
you  you put a lot of weight on the tributary question in your approach by giving up the hydrological connection. your response is you don't need a hydrological connection because it's right next to a tributary. but for those of us who are having a little trouble with the concept of tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.
thank you, mr. layton. the case is submitted.
the government doesn't say that "all" are covered. the government acknowledges that there are some actions that could still be brought in state court.
we'll hear from ms. blatt first.
was that a new program or an existing program?
well 
but i wonder whether 
it  we don't think it's a misrepresentation. the speech is funded by america's beef producers. the respondents in this case, the centerpiece of their first amendment argument 
temporarily.
it does not happen very often, your honor, but there have been several instances. the situation in bousley where the court found that the rights in bailey applied retroactively. i think most people would consider the court's recent decision in atkins v. virginia would apply retroactively in light of this court's earlier decision in penry v. lynaugh. so it does, indeed, happen and because it happens and because the rights involved in those types cases are so important 
in all of them except pennsylvania, 4 your honor. i'm not saying it's a problem, but in 5 response to justice scalia's question, only in a pure 6 future dangerousness state will you have a pure future 7 dangerousness argument. and just one final comment on simmons. as a 9 prosecutor, if i'm putting on a future dangerousness case, 10 i do it just like this prosecutor do it. i put on this 11 man's significant violent criminal history. i tell the 12 jury the lessons he learned from that history is to be 13 violent and to not leave anybody behind. and i tell the 14 jury that's what he's like. that's what he learned from 15 his prior crimes. that's the message of future 16 dangerousness you send to the jury. that's the message 17 that this prosecutor sent, exactly how you would do it if 18 you were arguing future dangerousness. you know from the 19 jury's question they got that message. if i may, i'd reserve the rest of my time for 21 rebuttal.
because that's proximate causation. and that's higher than we were required to prove under a doctrine of equivalence, your honor.
yes, you may, ms. percival. ms. nield.
i don't 
well, your honor, i am, i am confident that if the court chooses to proceed on the merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits, until it finds 
there had been no dispute about whether reimbursement claims could be brought in federal court. the courts  the courts were in agreement on that. what there was a dispute about was whether denials of benefits cases could be removed from state court to federal court. and what congress did was it followed the erisa model and changed the preemption provision because the preemption provision was what had been giving the courts problems about the removal issue. and so congress did, i think, what the courts told it to do, was get rid of some language in the preemption provision that is hampering federal jurisdiction. congress did that and created federal jurisdiction. nonetheless, now we come up with a new dispute that had never been a problem before 
 california itself recognized that there was a problem here of jury confusion. and now they have amended the provision so that it would be clear to any juror.
but 
what the second circuit said, which i think is correct, is that  is that your damages have to be totally and apart from the fraud as a purchaser, and that where 
i was just getting to that, justice stevens 
i mean, it would be more likely that we would dismiss this, improvidently granted.
it did not do so, your honor, because specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved to the states the primary responsibility of regulating pollution within its waters. the primary responsibility. that primary responsibility is not designated to the respondent in this case. a shift would  in  in that framework would shift the primary responsibility to the respondent and take that primary responsibility away from the state.
what we want to find out is whether the colorado 
which wasn't a government speech case.
it may have been, leaving aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it may have been wrong. but what it thought it was doing it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a jurisdictional reason.
of course, he does actually say kill him now at another point in there. but i think if you take those comments, you also look at those in the context of where he goes on and on about the consequences; you need to send a message to the drug dealers, that's a huge theme 
your honor, i think that brookhart in fact probably supports our position because in brookhart the situation was factually different. it was more of a  a guilty plea situation where there was going to be this prima facie trial, which was, in essence, a guilty plea with a profferer through one witness. and in that case, the defendant stood up and said, i want a trial, i want everyone to understand i'm not pleading guilty. and this court said that counsel can't waive those rights to a full trial when the defendant is objecting to it, but if the defendant consents or acquiesces, this court said the ruling would be different. well, certainly mr. nixon at least acquiesced. mr. corin spoke to him on three occasions  and that can be found at 255 of the joint appendix  and talked to him about this strategy. mr. nixon never responded either way as to his assent or what he wanted to be done. now, judge ferris, who was the third trial court judge who heard this matter, said that because of the longstanding relationship between this defendant and this lawyer, because he had represented him three times before over a 2-year period, that there was a level of relationship, they were both veterans of the criminal justice system, they had a rapport with each other. and she was able to determine that there was consent to the trial strategy in the fact that mr. nixon did not object to it. the florida supreme court wants explicit and affirmative consent, and they want a colloquy on the record. and we think that this will be very problematic, and we're already seeing these problems in florida.
we're concerned here with the court of  the role, if any, that a circuit court, that opinions of courts other than this court have in determining whether law is clearly established. do you exclude entirely from the province of what is proper for the federal court to consider any court of appeals, federal court of appeals decisions?
and that 
not  not the totality of 
there may be but prior to that, there  there should be a burden on the defendant to, first of all, articulate that the restraints are visible and make a record on that. and second of all, to 
that's  that's correct, your honor. the  the government's position, as with the state of washington's position, is that the  the analysis is simply did the facts known to the officer, viewed through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer, establish probable cause. and that to make an evaluation of the arrest turn upon the officer's subjective assessment of those facts  in other words, the working of his brain, the crunching of those facts that results in the spitting out of a legal conclusion  is contrary to this court's precedent and guts the objective reasonable test, and would make, instead, the validity of a fourth amendment action turn upon whether the officer is particularly smart, whether he's new, whether he's nervous, whether he says nothing at all or whether he decides to say, you're under arrest for everything listed in the washington code book. under those circumstances, the results would be different. the  the concern that your honor raised about police officers engaging in a post hoc rationalization i respectfully suggest is not a concern that is rooted in reality because the facts continue to drive the analysis. whether or not a police officer is right at the arrest scene in invoking a particular statute, if that turns out to be incorrect, it is still the facts that were known to him that must support probable cause for some other offense.
and it has not waived. not that the district court was  didn't have enough evidence before it. it says the foregoing, landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective assistance. so how can you possibly say that that question is still open?
 someone says that as a reason for refusing to host a message of an unwelcome messenger, that's a compelled-speech violation.
it  it went up once within  since  since stanford and then came back down. now, whether this  this period in which it comes back down is going to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to where we were 10 years ago i don't know. that's entirely hypothetical to suggest that  that this very recent trend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10 years.
it appears at page 90 of the joint appendix, your honor, and that's the brewer joint appendix. now counsel read that definition to the jury, and the definition reads as follows: "a manner of doing an act characterized by or resulting from careful and thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as though allowing time for a decision." now counsel read that definition to the jury during his closing argument. he argued that brewer's crime reflected poor planning and execution, that he was led into it by other actors, by his girlfriend christy nystrom, and that his commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness, depression in this case, were argued specifically as cause for those faults. and so counsel related the evidence within that deliberateness instruction to the jury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle to give effect to this evidence.
macaluso and nelson. nelson wasn't involved in the jury selection in this case, was he? he came in 
no, no.
don't  don't all 
i believe so, your honor. the indictment in wesley's case included a specification that he was the principal offender, so at the very least, the indictment would 
but you would agree that it would be consistent with the  the text of the majority opinion to say it really meant they have to prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the inappropriate sentence, which could be less than  even a 50/50 balance?
but i thought that that was content. you could do it, say, in the press, but you couldn't do it over the air.
suppose we apply brecht. this is what i'm having to little trouble with but i'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. the ninth circuit holds two things according to the sg in the briefs. he states them very well. the first is let's look at this witness. the testimony was excluded. now the ninth circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of  an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. so that's their finding on the merits. then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. how could both those things be true? how could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? that's one thing they say. but the exclusion was harmless. i just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. but maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what i'd appreciate your explaining.
for  for preemption, the text of the current statute that you rely on.
but it's unlawful to have wig wag lights, and i take it it's an arrestable offense to impersonate a police officer.
that's right.
well, i guess that 
no?
 and he refuses to do that, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells the truth, and he's fired. what result?
i think a lot of people who buy property at tax sales do read those notices regularly.
its members.
okay. so you're not saying that  that federal law is  is pervasive here, that it covers the  the entire  the entire suit between the claimant and the insurer.
they might have been afraid that you'd sue them.
there  there are very few cases that don't involve covered securities because virtually every security is covered. there are very few cases that aren't covered class actions because if they involve more than 50 people, that's about all the requirement there is. those are the jurisdictional prerequisites. that, if established, gives the court subject-matter jurisdiction. then we have the substantive elements of the slusa preclusion defense provided in a different statute that is not jurisdictional, just like this court described in arbaugh. the covered security and covered class action congress made jurisdictional by putting them in the statute. the substantive elements of the defense congress did not make jurisdictional because they're in another statute. that's the disconnect that judge easterbrook understood so that on the face of the opinion of the district court, where it recites the defendants maintain that the in-connection-with requirement was met, that defense, if colorable  and it clearly was. this court has accepted it in dabit  conferred jurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive decision on the merits was the merits determination. that is the decoupling that congress did in slusa, that judge easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts this case squarely within the thermtron exception to 1447(d).
we  we proffer to the court that they shouldn't be taking inconsistent positions as to  in a death penalty case in the sentencing 
but, your honor, that would then assume that this court decided an issue about the meaning of the hobbs act that was never presented in the cert petitions, never briefed, never addressed in the opinion.
 and that  and so is that made in the courts below and everything that they're doing in the cases 
do any of the court of appeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity of this definition in which, although it starts out with the word includes, then follows a  a listing, a, b, c, and d, and then it repeats one, but only one, of the items on the list and says groups of these items, i.e., individuals, are included? that's the peculiarity of the definition. do any of the courts of appeals come to grips with that?
the significance of excerpting that provision was to, in part, demonstrate that congress was, indeed, aware, consistent 
well, i think it's  the  the moment to consider is not just the moment when the officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the choices that, i suppose, the officers had. they could find out what was going on and address the situation, or they could withdraw, doing nothing, and then leave amy hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive situation. they  we don't know exactly what  what officer mooney said when he went back into the living room, but what we know is that there was no apparent interrogation of any type. we know that amy hammon at that point told him the story of the argument that had taken place and the resulting physical abuse. now, what we know from  from the accusation test that is put forth by  by the petitioner is that the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all statements to  to police officers is that it must somehow take account of the co-conspirator statement. but we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test in the history of the confrontation clause. the test that we are proposing, the broader test that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows directly from statements in crawford suggesting that the way that we know what is testimonial and what is not is by examining the lessons of history. what we're proposing is that in any particular context, if the statement resembles one of those historical abuses in the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance it's testimonial. but if the 
plus, you always have to show causation, and many, many cases are dismissed on the basis of summary judgment, even termination cases on the basis of causation.
how common are those statutes?
mr. clement.
it  it is more difficult, but  but the disparity between 
well, now, nelson  there's macaluso?
correct.
yes, your honor. we might not have an interest in pursuing the case, but we have a legal interest in terms of article iii case or controversy. it is well established that the  the fact of taking a judgment does not make a case moot. in fact, if there were a holding that we think that the federal case were moot 
right. i'm sorry. right. under  it  the alternative theory would give more power to the jury to impose labeling restrictions than the state, and we don't think the state can do it. and it would be far more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation. no one would read the label, much less understand it.
i don't believe so, your honor. it's certainly not alleged in the complaint that there is a personal guarantee. and  and i don't think so because when domino's sued jwm, it did not sue mr. mcdonald. and  and as i say, if  if they had, i'm sure mr. mcdonald would have put up his hand and said, no, thank you, that's not my contract. and i  so i don't  i think that really what we are asking the court to do is just to look at the language and  and read it in light of these well-established principles because that's what congress would have intended the court to do, and that he is not a third party beneficiary. he is not a party. and so the ninth  the rationale of the ninth circuit would need to be reversed because that's all it relied upon. and then the alternative theory 
i think there would be taxpayer standing if i understand that. and i realize that, you know, one could say well, that's is a fairly artificial distinction. but i do think that it is suggested by this court's precedents and the reason that it makes sense is that when you have injury  where the real injury is the spending, the fact that you're not supposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers, that's an establishment clause injury, then it makes sense to say that people that provided that money in the in the first place have a distinct injury.
well, so in  in this case, they could have entered in your view if they had specific knowledge of the gun and disposable contraband.
well, it  it  i don't believe it is, your honor, because of the sequence of statutes. you have to start with the 1882 statute and what the supreme court has said. but  but i'd like to make a preliminary comment before i turn to the substantive points here, which is that nobody has ever suggested, not the fourth circuit and not the respondent, any reason why congress would want the result reached by the fourth circuit, in  in 1887 or in 1948 or any other relevant time, to uniquely restrict the access of national banks to federal diversity jurisdiction. indeed, the suggestion is incongruous that congress would want to do that. national banks are, after all, federally created and federally regulated instrumentalities.
 leasing context here.
no, but i'm talking about jurisdictional purposes.
it can  it can be better but not much better?
yes, we have 
is there any significant difference between this case and wolff? i mean, wolff was a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting good-time credit. wasn't that what 
notice of what?
why?
no, your honor, in terms of the government is specifically authorized by 1964(b) to get a preliminary injunction. and the reason for that is, generally the government can't get injunctions to stop criminal activity. 1964(b) was added for that. but i'd say 1964(a), to go to your specific question, would authorize anyone to be able to go to the federal court to use any of the federal court's inherent powers.
if that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?
all right.
so you think you're  you're entitled to 100 percent under arkansas law, but  and i take it, that would be without regard to what the federal law required. the arkansas law can go beyond  just looking at the assignment provision, beyond what the federal law requires you do as a condition of participation in medicaid. correct?
or they could say the middle term will always be reasonable. couldn't they say that?
it could be construed as a freestanding offense provision 
that  that  you do not have  you do not have to decide it, but i would certainly urge the court not to proceed on the assumption or make any comments that there is because there were  there were 
all right.
when you  is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the  that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?
yes, but it seems to me the statute doesn't really say that, does it? but i mean, what the statute says is that if it's in perfect equipoise, the state loses because the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the  that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators. it seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect equipoise, the jury would have to say the state has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators. what  isn't that what a jury would have to say?
that  this point was not  would be you're asking us to decide it in the first instance. you, i would expect, make argument to the district judge when you go back.
it is a function of the population in south and west texas.
they do it. but then on  if you look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, the ninth circuit later on go on to say, in the middle paragraph, "as expressed in kahn's, the fair-use analysis only complements the likelihood of confusion  likelihood of customer confusion analysis." and then they quote from transgo, and they say  explain that "anyone is free to use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the source of goods." in effect, what they're doing is, they're expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive words. essentially what they're saying is 
why not? because my  when i first looked at this, i thought, well, this is the kind of thing that should have been  should have been resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn't have even have to get to arbitration if he's right. he wants a survey to see if he's being picked on. if he is, there would be redress. so it seemed like this was the kind of complaint that was best handled in that kind of procedure.
well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the jones act. it might still be a vessel.
i'd just respectfully disagree, your honor. but  but the  the larger point is if we allow this rule in general, we are going to engender serious problems. i'm saying that there  that there was some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.
the  you can find them; they're in the appendix to lopez's blue brief, justice scalia 
i understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other. what do you rely on for that?
i didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.
you're splitting up two things that i think go together. that is, this is not just a call. this is a cry for help.
what 
but then the question becomes is it material, is the variance material, is it far off from what alleged? here nothing was alleged.
our position is that the venue provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies requires that they establish an overt act and that venue would lie 
well, your honor, what  our position is that, although they applied the law of municipalities and the state, what they were really doing is applying the louie doctrine, which says that when you cannot identify a private actor, then the best evidence of what the state's law is, with respect to the actions of a party in the same circumstances, is to look at the state liability, and that 
can i ask  it seems very strange to me. i can understand protective filings when you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange protective filing. when you've won in state court and the government has taken certiorari, can you file, file in federal district court? what do you say? what are you complaining about?
and the brochure doesn't tell what they are. this thing, it says grounds?
my question is why don't we just look and see what they intended since they wrote it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is read it?
what's the 
the due process violation, your honor, would be 
 whether we made the 
you  we  we say this  this procedure is no good. the state comes up with another procedure, and you challenge that one. right? and  and another few years go by.
we  yes. i mean 
is it content? i mean, it doesn't say which way you're trying to influence the election.
justice scalia, the way these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other side says this would be obvious in light of a particular piece or collection of prior art. you may have a nonprior art motivation to combine them, but you're going to say something else already exists. they say it's asano, and you're going to combine it with something else. this is their motion. their argument, the argument that was presented to the federal circuit, was that you would take asano. that's why 
that's the whole problem with your case.
justice ginsburg, what the other side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in which a district judge becomes the special master of the cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that would require some modification to the ship 
it would might also be reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.
what about the insanity defense?
but we decided, in dames & moore, that he was acting pursuant to the agreement.
wait, wait. i thought we were just talking here about state law as to whether shall means shall. do you think that it's a matter of state law whether, if it does mean shall, it creates a property interest for purposes of the federal constitution?
it's 97 in the joint appendix, your honor.
no, your honor.
it's an opportunity to elaborate reasons. it's a safeguard. it's not a deterrent. and you're saying it has to be a deterrent. and as justice breyer indicates, it  it means that there's  there's another voice in that  in that administrative hearing room. they're terrified of damages.
but, justice scalia, it's not just 8 the depravity argument. the argument is he learned a 9 lesson to leave no witnesses behind. and the  the 10 simplest answer to your question is to compare the 11 argument in simmons to the argument in this case. you 12 quoted the argument in simmons in your simmons dissent. 13 it was the  this is the prosecutor in simmons. the 14 defense in this case as  the defense in this case as to 15 the sentence is a diversion. it's putting the blame on 16 society, on his father, on his grandmother, on whoever 17 else he can, spreading it out to avoid his personal 18 responsibility. but we are not concerned about how he got 19 shaped. we are concerned about what to do with him now 20 that he is within our midst. and that was the argument 21 that justice o'connor and the plurality in simmons cited 22 as bringing future dangerousness to the jury's attention. 23 to put it 
no, i understand. i'm just curious to know what sort of  what sort of evidence could ever support an  an expenditure limit in your view, if  if any.
we keep doing this.
any damage to the mail, itself, would be covered to the exception  by the exception. for instance, if a  if somebody had ordered their medication over the  you know, through the medicare act, and they had ordered it from a warehouse somewhere in idaho, and the  during the transmission of the mail, the medication had been lost, well, if somebody was injured, if they had a stroke or they had a heart attack because they didn't get their mail on time 
thank you, mr. bolick. the case is submitted.
 if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the ira.
yes, your honor.
yes, but what it says right after that to explain is it would have been sufficient. what he  what he should have done was knock, and that would have supplied all that was necessary.
then what you're saying, if i understand it, is that when the arizona statute refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong, the criminal act that they are referring to, on your view, is the act of intentional killing, period. and if that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he thought he was killing a martian. but if the arizona reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the act in this case  i.e., killing somebody you believe is a martian  then the evidence could come in. so, i think your argument means  your argument rests on the assumption that the arizona statute's reference to the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in general, in the abstract  i.e., intentional killing  - as distinct from the act of killing somebody you believe to be a martian. is that correct?
it  it was pointed out in  in one of the briefs  and i  i didn't go back and check it myself, but i'd like your comment. it was pointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in vermont were substantially close to or even  even higher than the  than the limits in the missouri scheme, out of which the shrink litigation grew. do you know whether that is correct?
 companion 
your honor, the "pollution," as defined in the clean water act, is the alteration of the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the water. that's the pollution. the reason 401 exists, and the reason "discharge" is used broadly, and it's the trigger for the section to work, is because you look at the impacts of that activity on the environment. you look at the physical integrity  has it been altered?  the chemical integrity, the biological integrity. we look at things like the impact on aquatic ecosystems, the thermal stratification in the impoundment areas, whether there is lower dissolved oxygen. and certainly we look at the fish migration issues. has there been blockage?
well, justice souter, what i would say is, what congress had in mind in enacting these substances is, they were concerned about drug abuse, not for its own sake, but for the debilitating effect it has on people's lives, for its tendency to destroy lives. and i will grant you that congress, in 1970, did not have before it in its contemplation a state that would make physician-assisted suicide lawful. but that's because it would have been unthinkable at that time. and what congress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact that a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse was the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses. and that's page 35 of the house report, for those that look at legislative history. and i actually think that's 
 use the program. i mean, as we suggest, if you're at a 50-50  i mean, if you're anywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be no liability under the sony standard. if you're above that level and there's sufficient evidence that you're really targeting infringing uses, then i think maybe there would be liability. but in the hypothetical you suggest, there would clearly not be liability in that situation. what we would like to suggest, though, is there ought to be enough room for  under the sony test, before you reach actual inducement, to capture somebody where they've clearly set out, as a business model, to deal with the infringing uses. and the only thing they point to are the theoretical possibility, anecdotal evidence, that it could be used for public-domain works.
i'm sorry. you go ahead.
 is that 
so that could be a week or 2.
he raised that as to that one aspect of mitigation. but it would have been very simple for him, a simple matter for him to argue i didn't understand the whole concept of mitigation. i didn't understand what i was doing.
 he'd be an illegal alien.
your opponent says  says there is no probable cause requirement. you are now on there's no objective test. it's all subjective. i suggest that there could be an objective test. this is not going to the probable cause question. objective test? was this case thrown out at the close of the government's evidence?
i think the  always, the relevant inquiry, especially in light of the statute  or precisely because of the statutory language, the inquiry is whether or not remedies are, indeed, available and capable of use by the inmates. so, without any further facts, yes, i would treat a 2-day 
this case, not united foods. because united foods, the court said it  it was not legitimately before us.
but could congress pass a law forbidding it?
but that tax did apply to out-of-state businesses 
the urgency certainly in  in the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods. and that's why i say that it falls outside of the rule that the government is arguing for today. but, justice scalia, i think 
it's assault in the second degree with the additional deadly weapon enhancement.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
at the sufferance of the united states.
do you agree with justice breyer that the legislature can draw this with more precision than a court could?
uh-huh. uh-huh.
get to the convention 
 if you adopt a principle that every employee ought to  ought to report to his superiors known wrongdoing by his co-workers, and that that's part of his job duties, you  then you always cut off the ability of that employee to go public, right? i mean, that's a  sort of an expanding category, "job duties."
 substances act.
yes, okay  used to be the federal power commission  tells them, "you have to get approval to build your dam. and we're not going to give you approval unless you comply with state water quality standards." this seems to me to go back into ancient history, like 1920. and of course you have to comply. and so, isn't the purpose of  is there agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or does it concern water quality standards?
that is not a moral 
 that was after  i guess the question would be under johnson, whether or not it could be considered in some manner.
what was the date of the sullivan case?
 when cert is granted.
yes, i'm sorry, yes. yes, your honor. i would also point out that when congress amended in 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that they intended to change this and that's what's so fundamental about the position - the district court position. this is a gaping hole in the core purpose of the lanham act.
but the it is not negotiable. we think of a health plan, a retirement plan. that doesn't have to be any set coverage. it's negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will be. here, the law determines what the benefits will be.
yes.
well, i  i want to be responsive and i think the way to respond is that this court's decision recognized that these ads were going to be difficult to classify and that you needed some kind of bright line rule and that the consequences of having a bright line rule in this consequence  in this area weren't terrible because there were alternative ways for them to communicate either through a separate, segregated fund which served the interests of the statute or by avoiding the kind of references that would raise serious questions about tying the ad to a candidate election. and i think if you look at  if  if you want to keep the possibility open of some as-applied challenge and you focus on these ads, these are ads that clearly, i think, would implicate the concerns of congress.
yes, justice ginsburg. but zipes also dealt with a legislative history where they referred to it as a statute of limitations period. zipes also said, okay, we have other cases where we have used the term jurisdictional, but more often than not, we've referred to this as a limitations period. zipes looked at the whole context and said, yes, we're not going to be held by a few random, maybe casual or careless uses of the term jurisdictional, but we are going to look at the whole thing. here, the legislative history has traditionally referred to this as a jurisdictional provision. the '72 amendments, which increase  decrease the number of employees necessary from 25 to 15, referred to it as an expansion of jurisdiction. this court has had the matter come up before it always in jurisdictional terms. this court has referred to this. eeoc has referred to it as jurisdictional.
so your  you would prevail even if there were no probate exception in your view.
yes, i have that in front of me.
i don't  i don't know why  why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading stage.
thank you, mr. blanchard. the case is submitted.
thank you, counsel. mr. cruz.
we don't know how far that is because the record is silent as to the distance between those water bodies.
he is, your honor, but i would suggest that there is no further evidence that was presented that he was attempting to present in state court regarding whether his waiver was knowing or voluntary.
we don't know that all the circuits have that interpretation.
 a separate offense?
can the district get damages from the government?
or party joinder, which is your case.
black and white alike?
yes, your honor, but the money that's identified in the budget is not  well, it's not the entire air force one appropriation that would be challenged in the kind of claim you're talking about.
 that it 
but if you have to 
no, it doesn't 
petitioner is not challenging the underlying assessment against the taxpayer.
mr. moran, is it undisputed by you that the client would not have disposed of the drugs if the police had waited a few seconds?
so your position is that that official's official positions were determined by the donor groups, as you say in your brief.
no. the burden of proof on the element of inducement. that is, there are two elements.
 the permissible limits, it's a violation.
well, i guess maybe the question is, what is your point? and i have the same question as justice breyer, and i'd just like to pursue that. if a case, a hypothetical case, is one in which the second prong of m'naghten, knowing the difference in right and wrong, gets to the question of his capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient? i think that's justice breyer's question.
well, do you intend to 
the pennsylvania supreme court now has said you should plead in the pcra petition the exceptions.
 i wanted to point out that the holding 
 is a new subsection.
but the court, there, i don't think was  it said that it was not in  giving any deference to the sec's position, because it was an implied private right of action that this court had recognized, and that the lower courts had recognized.
the california supreme court's decision was a reasonable application of boyde and the ninth circuit's reversal of it is  and this court should 
i think the reason justice breyer's test is a little more administrable than you're willing to admit is that it's not a question of motive. you're not asking why they did it. you're asking where the predicate act is directed, and if the predicate act is directed to lowering the  the firm's taxes so that it can compete more aggressively, that's one thing. if the  the predicate act is directed to, you know, blowing up the other firm's warehouse or  or, you know, something like that, it's a different matter altogether.
your honor, if i could respond to that in two respects. first, it is not, it is not the case that the pit maneuver, as it's commonly called, is safe. what it does is spin the car out, and if mr. harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is more likelihood that he would have lost control. in other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control. the second response i would have is that the petitioner did ask permission to do the pit maneuver and the permission that the supervisor gave, which was mr. faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use force up to deadly force. so mr. 
here, as in franklin, as in davis, as in cannon v. the university of chicago, as in every one of this court's title ix cases, indeed, as in all of its title vi cases involving federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry. ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the 
collective 
 a response 
could  could you refer to something?
justice ginsburg, it is an unsettled question, is the answer. i will give you the best answer i can. 203(o) allows for the negotiation away of clothes changing time. the question whether clothes-changing time includes safety equipment is a matter in dispute. the ninth circuit held that it didn't. this court denied certiorari on that question. the further question, if you did negotiate away the clothes changing time, whether that would negotiate away the walking and waiting time has not been confronted by a court, so far as i am aware. it might be said to logically follow, but it hasn't been decided. it's not presented by this case, because cert was denied. and so, i haven't thought very much 
that's exactly 
thank you, mr. shanmugam. mr. haglund.
now, any reason to believe 
you cannot picket cochran or cochran's law firm. period.
 if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there  there is dna evidence here. it's absolutely conclusive, and all that the light  the  the only doubt of the  the defense has cast on it is they found that there was some opportunity that the police could have tampered with it. that's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows. and therefore, it's not worth the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the jury. now, why would that ruling under 403 be unconstitutional?
the charge itself, justice stevens, is found at 63(a) of the petition appendix.
there are a number of ways to go at it. but if it turned out to be a disconnect, that would not offend at least my sense of what congress was trying to achieve here.
 i submit the screen is that set forth by this court in harlow, which is an objective standard and which is whether the conduct involved violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer or government official should be aware. that's why i tried to say earlier this standard that should govern this case is not probable cause, but the standard set forth by this court in harlow 
but with a 1  1-year enhancement or  i thought that that could apply in a case where the deadly weapon was a gun.
well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action? the states know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made. so i  i think that you  you may be right that the state knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates. and that doesn't  that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.
yes.
i don't understand your answer. if you were finished, i don't understand.
yes, your honor, because the jurors would  even if that instruction were given, the jurors would understand that an instruction that extenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any relevant character evidence. and this court has made these determinations all the time.
it allows parents to say i'm white, no matter what?
no. i think that is the difference, your honor, between absolute and qualified immunity. the court has given absolute immunity only to those functions that are so intimately associated with the judicial process, that they have to give immunity to those people, otherwise there would be an unjust interference with 
and our position is that congress made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision 
so i think you're  you're even on that 
i would disagree, your honor. the question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the first amendment. one reason why 
excuse me. may i  may i finish my question?
of course, of course. and you know, frankly, i think all of the defendants on death row 
general clement, there is a question i have about the government's position. and does place matter at all? i mean, here we're talking about the grounds surrounding a state capitol. what about every school room, if that's the choice of the school board? is it the same or do you make  or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?
well, i suppose any private entity can choose its market.
i'm asking 
no, your honor, it was just a training session that was just a  a section of the training session. it has  literally, i think there were 89 attendees, only about ten of them 
let me ask you about a domestic law question. one side is telling us it's the component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk or the object code. and the other side says this is just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template. can a blueprint be patented? can a mold be patented?
no, no. there isn't.
so that if  the question is whether fair franchising practices  were there unfair practices? you won a verdict that there was a violation of the fairness in franchising act.
this is an entirely legitimate, i submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal issue depending upon how a legal question is decided. the only thing that's been resolved is the amount that will be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of the appeal.
well then, the judge may have said well, i don't  look at the rule. i don't have it. i'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and put a proper order on in connection with the case. it would seem to me that at some point in the appellate process, because when you look at the history that the sixth circuit in this case  at least when the court then granted a certificate of appealability, you would think the respondent would  what are  why are you granting a certificate of appealability when you told us we have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from the two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction over the february 10th order that  on the appeal. and the  then the certificate of appealability was denied, and normally that would end the case. the court granted the  my motion for reconsideration, and then granted certain issues that could be briefed on the merits. but once the court granted the certificate of appealability, it seemed to me that the other side, well, what is happening here?
well, what's the standard under title vii when we talk about that, when we talk about enough evidence to shift the burden of proof? is that something less?
mr. donahue, were there earlier enforcement actions in which epa was taking the position that it took in this action against duke?
that's correct.
and you say that wouldn't be covered.
they do say that.
excuse me. why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?
but he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.
because there  there was no person in position at the time. the problem was we had to file this litigation before the statute went into effect because once the statute went into effect, thousands of michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to their right to appeal 
mr. gornstein, there are some old cases that draw a distinction between justifications and excuses. and you carefully use the words excuse to describe that defense. did you do so having in mind that distinction or just as a loose description of the  of the defense?
but 
thank you, mr. stewart. mr. mancino, you have four minutes remaining.
well, now it works both ways, though, mr. chief justice, because if  if it goes to my neighbor  let's assume numbers are transposed  it goes to my neighbor and the neighbor is there and sees the information, they'll say that the  that that's  that goes to across the street. and then you take it across the street and you get it signed. that's because you talked to a specific individual. so it is, in fact, designed to enhance the likelihood that it will actually get there. but i don't think the issue here is 
could i ask about grounds presented before we get off this? is it conceivable that the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of merit in the  in the grounds of application? is  is the applicant required to state why this particular appeal is worthy of being entertained?
right, but the  the focus of it is, as  as i understand it, and the  the kernel of it is  is the capacity to contract. and we can certainly understand, i guess, how tortious interference with contracts might come under that umbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, i take it, any tort that would give a recovery  recognize a recovery for  for dignitary injury would be subsumed with  within the concept of what 1981 was intended to  to cover, which is a broader proposition.
i 
 that causes 
 don't we assume that the court follows california law on the  on the burden? and isn't it clear that, under california law, the burden is on the defendant?
but the consequence of the jury verdict was  was the death penalty.
it's the guamanians, your honor. it is not 
what  what if she operated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the other 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and  and the shift was now she does  operates the forklift 2 out of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail ties? is that materially adverse?
i understood your argument to, in effect, contend that the behavior modification rationale will justify the program no matter what the balancing process is.
thank you. the case is submitted.
 just as driving a truck isn't.
and the term "concluding that it does outweigh" is something different from "weighing."
i still this is covered by chenery, but let's go to that. and so, here's the proposition. the proposition is that the commission has the untethered authority to force someone to provide a telecommunications service. and my question back to the other side is, where in the world in the statute is that? there is no textural foundation for it whatsoever.
mr. rovelli, i  i forget. how big a class of  of prisoners are we talking about?
no  no, we don't, your honor.
i don't think you can  you can use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can threaten unknowingly. if they felt it necessary to put "knowingly" before "use intimidation," i think they would have felt it necessary to put "knowingly" before "threaten." the two terms are just about identical.
no 
there was cross-examination of the mother, there was cross-examination of the police detective  there was cross-examination of 
but i'm not sure 
but this statute just  just goes in a circle because it ends. the way end  (a) ends is that after revoking the parole, the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the united states, which refers you back to  to 1231(a)(6).
that's right. it does seem to me that you are asking us to extend bivens, this is an extension. would you accept that?
okay.
it's  it's basically  in  in justice scalia's question, it is connected with what the  the client believes will be a favorable outcome by using the lawyer he wants. it's his judgment about what will probably be a favorable outcome, and his judgment about the lawyer who is most likely to bring that about.
well, the reality in prison is that people are pressured to join gangs and to  you either hang with your own or you don't and 
well, you see, my hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of the cases. i have no doubt you can go through the language and show that. and it's designed to say, but the very point of those cases is you do not send someone to death unless the jury decides that the circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person. and given the evenness of the balance, i don't see how we can say that, though i grant you, when you go back to those words in the cases, you're right.
well 
i say as a typical matter these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the judge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it later, you say, gee, he goofed. and so i'm not sure we should consider the plainness of the error or the fact that they  they do mistakes because they do.
you can  you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or i'll shoot you. but that  this was a far cry from that. in other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. it's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.
and the reason for a distinction, at least at the present time  the reason for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present time, as a source of applying this definition, is history, basically.
thank you, mr. long. the case is submitted.
as we argue in our brief, walton simply did not speak to this 
no, but i thought your  in answer to justice scalia, you said what was essential to the  to olc's position was that the offset is like a prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment without process. if that's the case, then timing should have nothing to do with it. conversely, as justice scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing official presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings. so, either there's no time question with respect to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with respect to the offsets, it implies an olc position that this provision applies to administrative proceedings.
so you would not have conceded.
yes, justice scalia. the chapter 13 trustee is probably characterized mostly an administrative person, who supervises to see that the chapter 13 procedures are complied with, has the debtor filed the chapter 13 plan. if not 
how many of the 13,000 are of that variety?
no, not at all, your honor, but i'm saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for the u.s. citizen, it's not any different, that the court retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release, and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison.
but there could be. there could be, both with respect to material in the public domain and with respect to people who authorize the transmission.
well, your honor, it's unclear what  what their thought process was in this matter. but i can say this, that the narrow category that escapes the coverage of this statute  there's nothing to indicate anywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the statute that that's what congress intended. and again, if you look at the overall view here, i mean, fugitive from justice. it's limited to someone from the state. person  let's look at 922(g)(9). very clear, incapable of misunderstanding. the same prefatory language. a person convicted in any court  exactly the same, and it ends with the same language  cannot ship, possess, receive. and what does it say? instead of saying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. and that's defined as a state or federal misdemeanor.
but why  why would anyone do that? they're  they're qualified without these restrictions. why would anyone want to cut off his  his rights to  to withdraw?
would you  would you rather put the woman on  if you had a choice, would you rather put the woman on the stand?
but you're 
it was not, your honor.
no. they just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it. should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently?
in this case, there are two things. the first, the berm segregates the surface water connection between the two, and then second, the nature of the soils being clay, which are not permeable soils, create the additional segregation between that and the body of water.
it's the character as mail that matters. mail that's been in transmission is what matters. and this 
does it make any difference how high the  the fee is set? if it were $10,000 a truck, does that raise any concerns that are different?
as awful as that 
right. but still it's  it's done beforehand as opposed to done after the crime has been investigated.
if it takes off, everybody will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares. now 
yes.
that is correct, justice ginsburg, and if i misunderstood the hypothetical, that  that was my mistake. as a matter of massachusetts law, a trial judge does not have that option. she must rule on the motion before the defendant decides to put on the case, and that is what happened here.
what  what date in  i mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting statutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use legislative history?
well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime? because, you know, you talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing it to a certain degree. and if you're not dealing with apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the comparison.
but those cases really are not on point. because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a three-judge court, do i file a jurisdictional statement, do i file a cert petition? sometimes this court said we'll treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition. but those existed from the beginning. here there's a case lodged in the court of appeals, the court of appeals had every basis of jurisdiction. this was no big shakes about it. it wasn't, did they file the right paper? and then congress does something. and the court would follow suit. it just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the date of that order is not the critical date, but you go back to the date that congress passed the law.
unlike the first amendment.
it came from a study by petitioners' experts of the actual operation of the system. and what they did is, they identified about 75 percent of the works as clearly infringing works, another 15 percent of the works were identified as very likely infringing works, then there were 10 percent they just couldn't tell anything about.
the  what the court actually, i believe, focused on there and in goldberg v. kelly was the question of whether there were regulations 
more than that, mr. hopper. i thought and i had expected you to  to respond to justice souter's question this way, his question about how come putting poison in  in the wetlands is bad, but it's okay to put it in the tributary. but they  as i understand it, the reason we held wetlands were included within the waters of the united states was not  not that, that you could poison the waters by poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and the wetland begins. and  and we said, you know, we're not going to parse that. if it's  if it's adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going to say it's part of a navigable water.
i think that  i think 
 that isn't relevant.
until they reproduce. [laughter.]
well, and i've been trying to make sense out of this court's precedents. (laughter.)
all right. but it  it at least contradicts your assertion that you have to be the defrauded party. you acknowledge that sometimes you don't have to be the defrauded party.
certainly didn't say it in the brief in opposition. and we might not well have taken the case had that point been raised in the bil.
the  there's no evidence which has been produced in this record which would suggest that the policy can be tied from skin color to gang membership and from gang membership to interracial violence.
your honor, i 
may  just as a  maybe this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief? did you ask for relief that the state be enjoined from using this method, or that the state be enjoined from executing him until an acceptable method had been found? because in the first case, the door theoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in the second case, presumably the issue would be resolved in this one case, as you suggest. so which did you ask for? injunction against this or injunction until an acceptable alternative came up?
but my question is you can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they deny the existence of any agreement and they explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers did in this brief. would you not lose on summary judgment?
then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said 
the  i believe the california court has misread title vii practice in several ways. i believe it has  it misread what is produced at the  it has misread what the plaintiff's burden is to produce a prima facie case. and under title vii, the plaintiff's burden is merely, as i stated, to show that a member of a protected group qualified, applied, rejected, position open.
well, all 
does this mean that the  the desk sergeant in the police station or who?
but that's when the child reaches majority.
if you parrot the flow control ordinance i think it's exactly the same.
in the same sense that it is pending after the trial court has acted but before the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants a state appeal.
no, but the 
 unless there's reason to do so.
my client is making a facial and as-applied takings challenge to both the hotel conversion ordinance and the regulatory scheme of which it is a part. and that claim  that federal 
well, the court recognized  arizona v. california is an example of the broader social interests that are implicated by the affirmative defense of res judicata. and the court noted, in arizona versus california, that it would be appropriate for the court to raise that defense sua sponte. and, of course, plaut versus spendthrift farm says the same thing.
well, justice breyer, if the system that you're describing is a replica of the system that existed under koon versus united states 
 why they passed it.
on the graphic script?
do any of those circuits allow an exception for plain error?
yes, justice scalia.
it says you must plead the facts with particularity.
what type of jurisdiction are you speaking of? it's certainly not federal jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under federal law. what kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?
not that i can think of, your honor. and i think the language of this statute, though  i mean, certainly though  of course, the court in mcdonald did interpret this statute to  to also protect white person  white  white people, people of all color, despite the language that says, you know, rights the same as  as whites. but 
well, i'm glad you reminded me of that point. i meant to make it earlier. in west lynn creamery this court said that these kind of things make a difference. there are certain ways you do things and certain ways you can't do things. if you place an embargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject to strict scrutiny. if you try to do the same thing by making it free and providing public  public  public collection, that's okay. and  and what the court cases say is do it the right way and we'll worry about the consequences later.
i  i thought that you were trying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be attributable to the other 
there are several remedies. in the first instance, any violation of a restraining order, she can petition the court for a contempt order, even against the police. if their conduct was willful and wanton, they can be held 
but their argument is broader. it says you can't look at each little piece. you've got to look at the overall structure, and overall they are doing it to extort a property right they don't want to pay for, and they are not doing  other people's cattle cross over and they don't prosecute them. now, let's assume that's correct on the facts. are you saying that they have no remedy for that type of extortionate activity?
 not that his decision to talk to the police was coerced.
the  the action is dismissed for a speedy trial act violation because the position of the petitioner here is accepted by this court and the government just reindicts.
there is no further proceeding if he writes the word acquittal, i guess until he changes his mind. so 3 minutes later, he says i change my mind. now there are further proceedings.
mr. haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, i have one question. two cases. a, hurtz did not testify at all. b, he did. is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as maples' testimony or is it the same? i.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if hurtz did testify?
and therefore, they shouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?
i think that is a fact, but, under seibert and elstad, is not the proper analysis. you don't look at  in seibert and elstad, the court did not look at whether the prior unwarned statement caused the second statement. the court looked at whether the cure effectively advised the suspect that he did not have to speak. and we're suggesting that the same analysis applies in the edwards context. you don't look at whether the improper comment caused the initiation. you look at whether the cure effectively conveyed that there would be no more questioning, that the choice was up to the suspect and the police were going to honor that choice. and once that cure happens and the suspect indicates he wants to speak, there's initiation. and then the court can go on to the voluntariness analysis. the edwards presumption of involuntariness imposes a high cost to the truthseeking function of a trial, to society's interest in having relevant evidence admitted at trial. and when the purpose of edwards is not served, when a suspect understands that questioning will cease, that high cost is not justified.
and  and when  when there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a berm, even from the storm drain which goes to tributaries, i can't conceive of  of how you could consider that that's  you know, at least where it leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a tributary, i think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you could call it a water of the united states. but where there's a berm that prevents any water from going even into the storm drain which then goes into a tributary, how can you possibly consider that a water of the united states?
 even in that case, that would not be a statutory discharge.
and is there any requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is it just a general liability?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
so if visitors  if there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner, you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're visitors too?
well, i  why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should  should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts 
yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to  we ought to read  we ought to read the limitation, which justice scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.
well 
that provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.
even on the basis of innocence?
mr. phillips, can i go back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the same meaning as in (b). is it not correct under your view of the statute that that meaning can include either of the two definitions that the two regulations identify? so that either  whether you start with (a) or the second statute, either statute includes both  may include both alternative regulations? official
sure, but they suffered the harm because the firm suffered the harm. there was  there was  there's a word there. there was  there was a victim in  in the direct line of causation, if you will, between them and  and the  and the offending rico party. here, there's  there's nobody in between the two of them.
but his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as i understand.
okay. it's  if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?
no 
so you're saying we would have to overrule missouri pacific?
whereas if it had been done by an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.
but the  but they urged. they recommended. they didn't come in and say  and throughout this proceeding  we don't know who the shooter is. we don't care who the shooter is. they both deserve the death penalty. they  they were  the prosecutors were aware that the  the death penalty is what stirs the pot here, and so they were urging somebody to be the shooter to get the death penalty. if this wasn't a death penalty case, i don't think they  it would have mattered who killed who. and so they were urging 
it's conceivable.
we don't know what it is. we haven't had the second case.
all right. so if the evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent you from considering it, then it's precluded. but if the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.
that if the search is a  for a valid law enforcement purpose, and it is reasonable in scope and manner, then it is a permissible parolee search, in california.
200 out of 13,000?
 overlook? what did it overlook?
and 
i'm sorry. outside the exception.
as i think as we 
yes, while the 
the sec refers the customers to the private lawyers if you complain. the securities laws are totally different from the icc, from the common carrier case.
in my 20 years of trial practice, i have never found it to be at the defendant's best interest to communicate with the police without counsel. i have 
i'm just wondering if that's 
i'm mean, i'm sure you're reading correctly, but is that in fact true? because, having talked, as i just read out a moment ago, having spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, on the basis of the foregoing facts i now draw the following conclusions of law.
well, justice scalia, i understand the sentiment, but she was  she was threatened by somebody with  with a gun and her children were threatened. and she might have killed him. she might have shot him. in either case, though, she is disadvantaged by the law. she would have been better off if she had shot him or killed him, and it's simply not consistent that she does a less blameworthy action, buying guns where nobody dies, her children didn't die, there were no funerals for her, no funerals for her children, no funerals for the abuser, nobody dies, but she's disadvantage because she doesn't 
is that going to be your third point, the third error that the court supposedly committed?
right.
well, if there's  i don't know whether there's a divergence between principal place of business and  and main office, which is what the comptroller, i think, considers the equivalent of the place of incorporation. it is possible. but remember, at the time all of these statutes were enacted, there would have been complete parity because principal place of business was not 
no. justice breyer, if i could just remind us how narrow the presumption is here. the presumption here attaches to one element in a tying case. there are still other screens. the other screens  the plaintiff still bears the proof of showing that there are two separate products. as justice kennedy pointed out, if two products are bundled together, if the tie is bundling two products together, there may well be a single product. if there's a procompetitive reason for a bundle, that will be screened out by the requirement that a tie involved tying product a to product b. if products a and b are combined as components in a single product, the screen of separability will operate. and 
before you get to that, do you think that that's the only statute applicable here? what about 1182(d)(5)? what's your response to the government's assertion that that's an independent basis?
well, your honor, the conflict is different, but it's really quite a more serious conflict than it was in gordon. in gordon the only concern was the sec might reinstitute fixed rates in the future, and it never did that in 30 years. here the sec says the conflict goes to our ability to define manipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the process of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.
what  what are they getting at when they say merit? i mean, i take it you concede there was a quotation from that contineri case on  cited on page 30 of their brief. i mean, what  what is the reference to merit supposed to mean?
your point of your answer to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible, but the content discrimination is permissible?
 where you're reading from?
well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies. you're the one that's arguing for special treatment based on public ownership.
yes. i'm taking the position that we don't know from this record that they were visible.
suppose it were saturday instead of a weekday.
i think that the instructions encompass the jury considering something not specifically in (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence because the instructions say, you shall consider the evidence presented, and that was payton's evidence 
well, i agree, your honor. and it's because the nature of mitigation is so open ended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and have a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.
yes. in  in the summer of 1984, before there was even a consulting agreement, there was a series of conversations between voss, the postal board  board member, and respondent, including one for which there are notes in which voss said i am working for you. there  there was an  there is an abundance of evidence involving reedy who is  no. i  i know, but just in  just in terms of  just in terms of the sequence. there is evidence that voss and moore were good friends. voss said that he had a close relationship with respondent, and when the contract was first being negotiated, reedy acknowledged that voss and moore were good friends. they had a close relationship. they were not distant.
oh, that's  that's a criminal proceeding.
well, not everyone. i'm not clear on it.
 interest. but, i thought your argument on compelling interest was that the only compelling interest that the government can assert is the discriminatory interest.
so, the prosecutor, i take it, would have answered justice stevens's question the other way. the prosecutor would have said, "well, no, this probably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to the gravity of the offense."
that  that is, in fact, the point, justice stevens. the double jeopardy clause is a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's benefit. he  that's what this court said in jorn. the defendant has to know whether he  he's defending a case.
i think not, your honor, because 
but, justice ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because  and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.
and what would you show? what do you, in effect  make an offer of proof.
no, i mean a setoff 
i mean, if you are appealing to this broader principle, that you either waive all of sovereign immunity or you waive none of it at all, and you can't just restrict it to the particular claim, which is what (b) says, i don't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.
he may be housed with new entrants into the system and that  that's the reason 
the hypothetical is 
well, that  i think that's 10 actually a critical point, justice kennedy, because our 11 view is that a  a state defendant should be required to 12 challenge his state conviction at the earliest possible 13 opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his 14 conviction in state court because that will be the time 15 when he knows about the basis for his state claim. if he 16 does that, by the time he gets to the federal sentencing, 17 you're not going to have the issue in this case because 18 all will agree that that vacated state conviction can't be 19 counted towards his federal sentence. so that's one of 20 the virtues of the interpretation we offer. it avoids 21 this circumstance entirely.
but not if there's, i presume, if there's an appeal.
well, presumably, your honor, if he's already  he's already promised that to the attorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with the attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him to recover or the dentist could sue him to recover.
the first amendment would not be the  would not be the source of protection. whether there would be some argument that, if the employee could not be fired, it would be an unconstitutional condition to require him to put his job at peril for committing a due process violation or something like that, whether there would be a claim like that, that would be a different matter. but the first amendment 
well, let's assume your  you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen with the police officer, talks to the police officer, and then signs an affidavit. did she sign the affidavit at that time?
right.
 that would be outside 704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for filing a complaint. just switch her from a work routine that she could easily manage and still take care of her family and to one that is impossible for her to manage.
yes, it does.
 that's why i'm approaching it differently, and i  i want to get your view on it. i'm taking the word inconsistent and i'm using that as a guide back into the purpose of the statute. and once i do that, i find congress here anxious, i think, to engage in what i'd call cooperative federalism. they could have run the whole show, but they said we don't want the fcc. we want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a few minimal procedural requirements. if that's right, that means all these damages questions are open. all kinds of things are open, but  and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe deferring to the state, but one thing is true: 1983 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.
would you  would you tell us again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you still go back before the  the special master to show certain facts?
but there was no  there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable.
thank you.
mr. frederick, on the defective design claim, presumably that's based on a factual theory that dow could have reasonably designed strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid soil.
and they also wouldn't be money-damages actions. so, the distinction the statute draws is not between money-damages actions in court and money-damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages actions, wherever brought, and the administrative proceedings that have to be brought as a condition precedent.
or  you know, or 
there was evidence it was a pistol. so i  i would have thought, reading this, that there was evidence. that's beside the point, but i'm  i'm just using it as an example where a judge might think she made a mistake. she thought there was no evidence that it wasn't a shotgun, and i guess she forgot that there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a shotgun.
well, then what was congress trying to do when they said strong inference? it seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no seventh amendment problem.
well, you see, individual jurors, in the course of deliberations  this is a qualitative judgment, after all, and individual jurors, in the course of deliberations, might be leaning one way or the other at different times during deliberations. but what this equipoise provision does is that it allows the jurors to compromise on equipoise when they simply cannot deliberate anymore, or if they simply just want to avoid making the hard decision.
and  and as for due 3 diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that 4 context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other 5 side, it makes sense in all other contexts and  and you 6 don't expect the language to be applicable all the time. 7 so what's wrong with that?
i'll be respectful anyhow, your honor.
but that's a 
yes, but you don't want us to decide the case on that ground. i mean 
i don't think so. the second one made by counsel for the government runs directly against citizens publishing. that was in the case, your honor. and no one has suggested that citizens publishing be reversed. and the second part is in fact they did that. they did act independently for at least 8 months.
 how in your opinion?
 that could happen.
let's take one of these classic discrimination cases involving milk. i think what you're telling us is that if wisconsin adopted a law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility owned and operated by the state of wisconsin, that would be perfectly okay.
i know it was in our brief in opposition, but i don't recall if i did in this.
yes.
 which i think everybody has concluded are mutually exclusive positions, but that's what it said. but, your honor, respectfully, we now know, because they've all written law review articles, that the people that wrote the house report, because they've said it, wrote those law  wrote those words because they knew that the language did overrule zahn and they didn't want to achieve that outcome.
that assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right? it assumes there isn't going to be a greater contribution of greenhouse gases from economic development in china and other places that's going to displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.
well 
why is that? why can't  eliminating the rule, i thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts, you have to sell it at this price, and they could enforce the contracts, rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers.
may i ask another question? am i correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43 of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of errors there, the fact that they were not raised until after december 11th would have precluded review at the trial court level?
but a limiting principle is the one that i  was identified by the court in lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. and the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the state of california is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.
your honor, the problem with the solomon amendment is that the government is demanding absolute parity. we have a statute before us that demands exactly the same services, without regard to whether the military actually needs them. in order for congress to justify the parity requirement, which is the only statute before this court, congress has to state a need. it has to say why it needs what 
i think that 
under our cases, can the california winery be required to remit the tax to the new york state revenue authorities?
i 
well, justice stevens, let me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take you specifically to the text, i can do that. but i think the bottom line would be that under our view of the statute, the most important thing is for those doctors, like dr. cranen or dr. vivicar, who try to do the d&e procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100 percent of the time. well, in the 1 percent of the cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not covered by the statute because they would not satisfy what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of committing the overt act of killing fetus. and in those cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing the d&e isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the dismemberment procedure. so they would not be covered by the mens rea requirement of the statute.
yes. but it wasn't that it was a new assignment; it was the former owner assigned it and the bla  blm approved.
 because that's already been decided by the michigan supreme court.
two  three.
yes.
well, what are the odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief? he's not going to let it languish under chapter 13.
well, but to the extent we're talking 
i do not agree with counsel. i believe that the ninth circuit did properly apply the turner standard in this case and that california would pass and does pass the turner test in this case.
so, you'd say it would be okay if the state didn't expressly concede the statute of limitations point.
yes, it is, justice scalia.
i don't suppose there's any  i don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there? i mean if indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product that's more expensive than what he needs or  and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? i mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the situation.
justice ginsburg, the only thing that i can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep ocr out. so  so therefore 
mr. smith, isn't there any principle of laches that comes into effect here? i mean, really what you're asking the court to do is to sanction a very odd checkerboard system of jurisdiction in the middle of new york state. some parcels, the ones the indians choose to buy and are able to buy, become indian territory and everything else is governed by new york state. this is just a terrible situation as far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the situation we're in is that the oneidas did not complain about this for 170 years.
but 
that is true.
because that property in guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree. it is property that must be valued for tax purposes.
well,
justice ginsburg, i can't answer that question in specific respect to this case, because there is no authority in the controlled substances act for anyone to do what has been done here  that is, to focus on the specific medical practice and say, "no controlled substance" 
but you're  no, i was going to  your whole point, i take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply  simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, i think, growing it themselves or being given it. you're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.
the dog sniff is not a search. what difference does it make?
the case is submitted.
we would contend, mr. chief justice, that voting against congressman bonilla doesn't make you a democrat. and it, in fact, highlights that the state was seeking voters, latino voters, who had withdrawn their support for congressman bonilla as opposed to just seeking democrats because you can vote against congressman bonilla and still vote republican in other races, as latinos did. and you could have been a former supporter of congressman bonilla. it doesn't make you a democrat in that sense that race and partisanship are completely interchangeable so that the state can scoop in and grab 100,000 people of the same race and then say later, well, we were taking out democrats.
has any  a number of courts have considered this question  have any of them accepted your first  your argument that the statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?
okay. let me answer it in a few different ways because i want to again specify and make clear what it is that the federal circuit says is included within teaching, suggestions, motivations. then i want to turn to our invention and the affidavits in the case. the federal circuit has said, and i'll just  you can come back to it for future reference. it's recorded at the bottom of page 19 of our brief. common sense, common knowledge, common understandings are all included within teaching, suggestions or motivations.
mr. gordon, in responding to justice ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal with the fact that this court said in the second swann case that the  that a school district, particularly a school district like swann which had been in violation, had been found in violation, had the same interest after unitary status had been attained in maintaining the unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status beforehand; that if those interests are identical why doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two interests, unitary status from segregation in one case, preservation of unitary status in the other, are reasonable if they are identical?
and i'm  i'm sure you'd be delighted. but that's not the case we're confronted with. and if the choice is between making up a new rule to make your test work or rejecting your test, it seems to me that the  that the latter might be the preferred course.
well, the  the appeal of his right  the appeal as of right point, as i understand it, is a different point. what they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it. we're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a  an  an adequate waiver under boykin.
why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case? is it not? wherein does it differ? i thought that the school district was selecting some people because they wanted a certain racial mix in the schools, and were taking the affirmative action of giving a preference to students of a certain race. why isn't  why doesn't that qualify as affirmative action?
what we are arguing about here is compensation, and the standard that we 
 over these other affiliations.
i thought your position was that it  it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases.
counsel, i'm not sure you're right that nobody was concerned about  everybody thought the factors were wrong. i don't think the trial judge did. the trial judge said he saw no possibility of prejudice.
thank you, ms. perry.
do i understand correctly that the complaint has since been amended to assert a federal income tax shortfalls?
thank you, mr. shapiro. general clement.
well, of course, i'm  i'm supposing that after this rule, there would be no trial because there would be  if  if you don't prevail, there wouldn't be a trial.
what about that australian case that was mentioned, i believe one case where they say 
i would say you are wrong, your honor, simply because california has construed its sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a reasonableness 
no. what it boils down to, your honor, is we're looking for a probable cause determination to be made in good faith.
i think he possibly would be able to, yes. yes, i do because prison clothes identify the defendant, and if a defendant is an escape risk, for example, that would identify the defendant in case he were to bolt from the courtroom, for example.
but in any event, the point is that the blm recognized that it had to negotiate a new reciprocal arrangement with respondent and it sought to do so.
of course, they don't compete. but do we know the department store has to be run that way? i mean, maybe some places it isn't. we can't prove it has to be run that way.
and that is involved  and that is  that is the whole point of  of knock and announce, isn't it?
well, would you waive damages against this principal who has devoted her life to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for this sophomoric sign that was held up?
in this instance, your honor?
and the argument that you have to face, i think, is that it will be very disruptive to have constitutional judges dive into this, when there are so many other remedies, and where the very act of their doing it, allowing discovery, allowing court cases, allowing juries, itself, will disrupt the government. now, if you say they give you no protection at all, i want to hear what you have to say as to what the standard is to separate the sheep from the goats.
 but if 
well, you have to say what it is.
 it would still be because of age.
in  even if, as he alleged, he was unable to do anything in 
well, it's certainly not 
well, it 
no. i'm not saying how did they? how in your opinion should the post office department or the government have found him?
in  in  particularly in a capital case, what this court and all courts would  would want is a reliable record where there had been testing. when you have a situation where mr. nixon, as here, said nothing, so the  so mr. corin didn't know whether there was consent or lack of consent, we would submit that what should have happened is, as i said  suggested before, he shouldn't have  he could have not contested certain things, but the admission on the  what i submit is an admission and a plea of guilty without consent was where the problem was. he could have gone on 
and that's what this court in 
that is absolutely correct. i don't see any basis for distinguishing between 
okay.
your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report. that's your basic premise?
no. the execution of a prior discriminatory decision constitutes a present violation of title vii. it's frequently 
that's true, your honor.
the court has been consistent 
the whole problem is that it's the county that's doing all that.
that isn't the basis on which the court decided this case, is it?
correct, if it takes off.
if  if this  if this tax was apportioned based on mileage, it would not be discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and 
and i think the dignity interest  excuse me.
i think i'm trying to help you. (laughter.)
i don't think so, your honor. and its certainly not the way that the 
it 
but that's not necessarily true. isn't it also possible if, at the time of the official first judgment the judge could have said, well you really haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final until the whole thing is over. but nevertheless, because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, i'm going to go ahead and decide it.
that's where i was headed.
can i ask you  are you finished?
he 
then  then you haven't contradicted what the chief justice suggested.
i wanted to see if there is a way that the class could be defined narrowly, because i want to ask the other side if they would allow the search for any ex-felon, for example. you could divide it in a way that seemed obviously too broad. but is 
and, of course, that basis doesn't apply to tributaries, does it? you  you can always tell where the tributary ends. it ends at the point where it goes into the main river.
and what would 
right.
on the facts that we had, if  if you analyze it under the federal standard  and i would submit to the court that we should apply 
 that the person is entitled to money, and ultimately the amount he's entitled to is determined by the litigation. and i'm not about to adopt a  a legal theory that  that views this as a  as a search for buried treasure 
your honor, i think the 
that failing  well, in terms of the lack of a precedent from this court, you know, at this point we can only speculate, but it seems to me that if a person can be required to submit to a drug test by virtue of the status as a parolee or probationer, i don't think that it is an extravagant step to say that they could be required to submit to an interview.
well, there  there are several 1 levels to the response. let me work through them. the first is that the petitioner's position 3 relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we 4 think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when 5 the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due 6 diligence.
no. no, it wouldn't be subrogated. the bond premium  the bonding company says we're entitled to priority.
well, it seems the court below said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going to engage in any debate about what  if waiting time is  - were covered, which waiting time?
well, if  besides the  what we believe was a fundamental  what was a complete failure  excuse me. aside from the guilty plea, what we submit is a guilty plea, we believe that when these kinds of statements were made, your honor, without the consent, that the advocacy system that was envisioned in cronic completely failed.
that's correct.
 7 percent 
exactly what we've got in exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source of the primacy. they say it's a source. does that still violate the establishment clause?
and so the state then came back and said we're putting in this new policy, we will give them new hearings under the new policy?
have we ever said that's a fourth amendment violation?
and you're prepared to defend the  the eleventh circuit.
 did she appeal that?
it is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the constitution.
yes, your honor. it was a case 
what it would do  let's take a case which i guess we  apprendi. i mean, you know, apprendi, a big sort of an issue in the courts. and  and this would put tremendous pressure on us to decide it immediately, wouldn't it? we'd have to say immediately whether it was going to be retroactive or not retroactive because it's only likely to come along in some major, major matter like that, other than the kind justice kennedy said, which is another kind of problem. i mean, i don't see a way, if we take your approach, of getting out of this tremendous pressure. maybe it would be a good thing. but i don't think there's a way of getting out of it.
no, but it makes perfect sense.
donuts and coffee. in other words, it counts as long as it's over $100.
all right, and the answer is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?
it makes all the difference in the world. they were trying to get the easement for nothing. i mean, it's very much 
but were you, was there any element of surprise in this trial? did you not know beforehand that the government was going to present evidence of two false identifications?
i'd like to get away from in rem and back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here. let's assume that there is an offset obligation that the state has to comply with, that there's been a preference and it has another claim, and with just one entity. if that's true, it seems to me somewhat unfair to say that the state can proceed on multiple fronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so that if there are more than three entities  or if there are three or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the offset obligation. it seems to me that if one state entity is subject to offset, then all of them are.
no, no, no. and it wouldn't  what i'm saying is there is at least one violation of 271(f) here. 271(f) looks exclusively at what is done in the united states. it is entirely irrelevant to 271(f) what, if anything, is done overseas. the federal circuit has made this clear in the waymark case and it's consistent with the language.
title vii doesn't have this language in it.
the government is incorrect, your honor. we have identified two wildlife refuges, the kenai moose range and the kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso. and here's why the united states is correct on that. they argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the alaska game law of 1925 rather than the alaska game law of 1943. in fact, your honors, those are the exact same statute. the '43 alaska game law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. what that means is that at statehood the kenai moose range and the kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the alaska game law of '43, which was the then-existing version. these refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. so those are two properties. and  and actually the legislative history  we don't think the court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule. but the legislative history does indicate that congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges. the kenai and the kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the state of connecticut. and congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the fish and wildlife service was that alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties. but there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the state under the main clause.
and so it said just the opposite. it said just the opposite, that if the health exception is no good, the rest of the statute would survive. isn't that basically 
your honor 
it depends  it depends in part.
and the president, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language.
yeah, but he didn't come in to defend; you pulled him in to defend.
well, perhaps they should be more consistent, justice ginsburg, but the overall  i mean, if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1), you can see that the thrust of this is  is to deal with domestic situations. there's one that says you can't own a firearm if you're a  a fugitive from law  a fugitive from justice. that's specifically defined as a fugitive from another state within the united states.
95 percent of patents are valueless according to petitioners' own statistics, but they won't arise in a patent tying case because if they're valueless, they won't be licensed. and if they're not licensed, they can't be used to effect the tie.
well, it wasn't a 2-year statute of limitations, your honor. in fact, it was slightly different from the federal statute of limitations as well. there is a provision that allows for newly discovered evidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of limitations, which by the way, the florida statute of limitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client was convicted. as you know, he says that he was told at his sentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts, on a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty in this case. and when 13 years came about, he inquired what's happening and they said, no, that's not going to happen. you have a release date of 2057. and as i think the court knows from its decision in linz v. mathis, florida  florida statutes really changed in that way. gain time was reduced gradually and then much more quickly so that someone who might have served 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the 99.
absolutely no certainty of that, your honor. but there is certainty 
yes, your honor. and we believe 
the  the eleventh circuit had a prior decision, didn't they?
 "make you any better off to talk to the lawyer"  sorry. strike. the reason that the policeman, to cure, would have to say, "look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the death penalty, to talk without your lawyer," is because that was the implication of his question, that was the implication  -
well, if that's so, that's 
would it make sense 
that  that is correct.
what is the basis in the habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas application despite the fact that some of the claims have been exhausted? is there any statutory basis for that or is it just, just judicial efficiency?
well, i'm not so sure quickly. they gave notice that there'd be a batson hearing. she should have known what's going on.
and that explains why your 12 state is the only holdout.
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
i'm suggesting the challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering challenge.
well 
or the tripps treaty?
i agree with that. the first amendment doesn't bar the government from disciplining employees for insubordination or poor job performance or for continuing or persisting in a matter once their supervisor's told them to stop. where an adverse employment action's motivated by such legitimate employment reasons, there's no first amendment violation. but the petitioners here have not claimed any legitimate interest in punishing ceballos for what he said, nor have they made the case 
suppose you have suspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing. it's short of probable cause, but you have reasonable suspicion. does that alter the nonconsenting party's interest and elevate the consenting party's interest?
i  it certainly can be read that way. i read it as more of an affirmative statement by congress 
 abraham lincoln used to study blackstone and i think he thought that the founding fathers studied blackstone, and all that happened in england was relevant, is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here? relevant.
it would amount to probable cause if the wife, who has  she's in a position where she would know what's going on in the house, what kind of activity is going on in the house, she is a presumptively reliable citizen providing information to the police, and the fact 
i believe if you study carefully this court's precedence, including graham itself and just about every other case this court has ever decided, what this court has said is the measure, what our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter that reflects a certain degree of skill. and this court has rejected time and time again the notion that someone who was the first simply to take advantage of the known capability of technology was entitled to a patent.
all right, so six.
that's correct.
that is very different than this case because what  first of all, we all agree that software code in and of itself, removed from a physical structure, cannot be patentable and when software  when some  when an invention that is practiced with software is patented, at the most what you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code which is language that humans understand and which computers do not. a lot of work has to be done in items of debugging and testing and compiling to create what is, by stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the precise, machine readable sequence that commands a computer's cpu millions of times a second. source code would do nothing. source code has to be worked on overseas.
 and under state  arkansas state law, it can't.
no, no, you are absolutely right. he has discretion not to do that.
so you're saying your position was and is that it's not inalienable without the approval of the feds?
thank you, counsel. mr. johnson, you have 6 minutes remaining.
he should. and, indeed, this court, in  as early as montgomery ward, have said that was the better practice, and that requirement has since been codified in what is now rule 50(c), which says that if the court grants the motion for judgment as  the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and there is also an alternative motion for a new trial, the judge should rule on that, as well, and should basically say, "in the event that my ruling on the jnov  or the jmol" 
not a situation where this is what the jury has said.
 only a search that 
what was the harassment that this employee experienced in the  in the ftca claim that was dismissed?
of course, this court, i think, has recognized that raiding is not a legitimate concern for the state that overcomes a party that would open up. and that's what the district court so held. we go into the inverse of draining and talk about the effect it would have on the republicans and democratic parties. i think the  the district court said several times in its opinion that the results would be highly speculative. but i say that the results would probably be to the benefit because it would ensure major parties that they got a nominee who was picked by loyal supporters of the party, and what would be drained off would be disloyal supporters who would rather be doing something else. and that, of course, is the essence of competition. we should not be worrying about protecting the major parties from competition for ideals. this is 
the california supreme court's decision 
it was not, not felicitously put. i think all the court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction. the only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you  where you do have jurisdiction. and so you do not have to  but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine. it is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. in that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.
well, then justice scalia's prediction is  is right. you just keep filing and filing.
we want a warrant that will let us go in immediately when we see it delivered. would you support that warrant?
the automatic 
well, then you're saying the instruction here was proper.
well 
in flynn, it did, but it also, just a paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we need to answer is whether this practice, and there the courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial. we don't believe that those are material 
it seems to me that  that interpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704 differently.
i imagine there's not  there's some little authority both ways. to put it in my perhaps  i know you disagree with this way of thinking about it. but i'm  i'm thinking about this article 36 and thinking that you're reading it as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can't do anything about it. and the other way is to read the silence as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can do something about it. we're not saying what. okay. now, between those two interpretations, we have the icj picking interpretation two and rejecting interpretation one in, i grant you, a different case. but i guess since a lot of these amicus briefs tell us throughout history, a long history, we've tried to follow icj interpretations of treaties to which we are parties. why  it's all up to us, but we've tried to. why  why should we not, given the two possible interpretations  they choose one. why should we not choose to follow theirs here?
ms. blatt, it  was this statute  i'm just really kind of curious that something this important, we're first putting this burden on social security  it's a fairly important change. was this part of one of these omnibus bills that covered 99 different subjects at once?
thank you, mr. sullivan. the case is submitted.
i thought you should be.
yes.
i'm sorry. then you get to the  the south carolina supreme court, and they don't keep it out on  on grounds of  of threshold reliability.
 you to say what specifically the answer to that argument is.
your argument's a little inconsistent with the franklin case, though.
the money is being used 
mr. eisenberg.
i think the key difference is the charging part of your hypothetical. your hypothetical assumes this defendant was never put on notice that he was facing aggravated murder, and if that were true, then under your cases and under  under our washington law, we would analyze that as a failure of notice. the  and it could have any number of implications for a defendant, including the evidence that they marshal at trial, but also including perhaps his interest in negotiating a plea agreement if a defendant doesn't know that he's facing aggravated murder at the end. so 
 if we  if we don't adopt 17 that kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that 18 the  that the argument that the prosecutor made, 19 particularly the  by  by introducing the  the 20 evidence of  of the prior crime for purposes of the 21 aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how 22 the defendant had learned from his prior crime  do you 23  do you deny that  that those were in fact, not with 24 the talismanic words, but that those in fact were  were 25 arguments that suggested future dangerousness?
but, more generally, it doesn't require that there be a purchaser or seller who's defrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the purpose of implied actions, does require that. justice stevens, you asked about whether there is any indication in the legislative history that congress intended this act to preempt class-action claims where there would be no federal remedy. the answer to that is, absolutely yes. it is perfectly clear from the legislative history that congress knew, and expected, that claims that could be brought under state law as class actions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-misrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfy the federal 
is that true in fact?
thank you, mr. feldman. mr. waxman.
thank you, mr. stris. the case is submitted.
yes, i mean, the 
correct.
may i ask this question before you sit down? in the viereck opinion, chief justice stone reversed in that case. and one of the reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice. that's part of our federal law. is that law applicable in this case, do you think?
the  in this case 
all right. then  then once 16 you admit that, you're going to have to find a difference 17 between this and the dna test, or your position here, if 18 adopted, will catch you out there.
no, the only information it had was the printed  the printed date by the judge. did not show it was entered that same day.
they would have an itemized  excuse me  a miscellaneous itemized deduction for the cost incurred in  in producing income that under the alternative minimum tax would not be allowed.
 so i'm not going to 
that's correct, your honor, but i would say that there would be no additional decision of this court that would be necessary for  for someone to conclude that all three provisions of paragraph 6(3) had been met.
but on the grounds for which they have been taken as authority, is it your view that we should repudiate those grounds?
the irony of this whole proceeding is it seems to me it would be a lot easier to decide the merits of that claim if the transcript is available than to get into all these issues 
what do you do about the eeoc's regulation? why isn't that  why isn't that entitled to chevron deference?

 nonnegligently.
that's what the court of criminal appeals has said penry i said, a deliberateness instruction or a catch-all instruction. so  but in both cases, both this court and the state court have said judges can give an instruction. and penry i's counsel made 
oh, sure. i 
and the fact that it's based in miami or it had mostly american customers really is not relevant to the legal issue. is it?
well, i 
well, they may 
but i 
if it please your honor, there are many times in which this court has said that the ftc does not have the authority or power to grant immunity from antitrust violations. in 
but could duke have had a challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations? could they have reopened the issue at that point?
 given a genuine choice?
so, the 
the subcontract?
there have to be two sales.
and it seems to me it's obvious that a  a company that does interstate business does not log all of its miles in  in michigan, and likely  likely  very likely does  does less miles in michigan than  than a purely intrastate michigan trucker.
well, yes, that's why courts review these things.
i don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?
 for resale.
no, i understand that, your honor. i mean 
so what is the point? the judge says, i'll give the prosecution the benefit of the doubt. well, he  he knows the prosecutor and he believes the prosecutor. i didn't see it, but i'll give him the benefit of the doubt. he told me that's what she did. what's  i mean, i really don't see why that isn't, given the present law, sufficient.
right, but then we're back to the rental income question, and the question of whether it official would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying that rental income. and the answer, we submit, is no. and the problem that i think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us back, i think, to the assumption you asked me to make at the beginning of the argument, that something is a covered practice under the act. and so another way to understand the distinction between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of the act doesn't cover everything in connection with a communications service. it only covers certain practices in connection. and the history, as well as the text and structure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting as such.
but negligently drove. it doesn't say whether it went through a stop light. doesn't say whether it was speeding. it doesn't say any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.
well, munsingwear reaffirmed johnson v. wharton which said that where congress takes away the right to appeal, there is still collateral estoppel effect of the district court judgment. that  that was the previous decision that munsingwear affirmed.
that was a plurality portion of the opinion.
excuse me. i'm not following you. you mean the mental health expert's testimony could have gone to whether the judge should have accepted the waiver?
yes.
 it arises from a negative implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative implication from 1331.
i concede that point, your honor.
thank you, mr. haltom. mr. moody.
why was there that difference between the bia that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the ihs?
but that's not this case.
thank you, mr. phillips. mr. foster.
but i don't 
we  well, our primary submission is that it does not apply to any administrative proceedings, for the reason  reasons i've given, that official the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms are for suits in court. a "complaint" itself is ordinarily defined to be 
 government speech 
all right. you think it's  i'm just inconsistent.
 so for all activities that are  that are integral and indispensable? what about sharpening tools?
well, i thought  i thought it defined a duty. i  i agree with justice stevens. i  i've never seen it  are there other statutes where the contracting parties can decide whether or not they're going to oust federal law  or state law?
that's correct, your honor.
please 
i don't understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out. why would it make any sense to give a federal employee the benefit of trial in federal court when he committed the act, and then you debate about whether it was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive him of the benefit of a federal court when he denies that he did anything at all? why would you want one set of cases to remain in the state court and the other set of cases to go to federal court?
but to go back to justice ginsburg's point earlier congress could have included unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims for which a court could 
we're the government and we're here to help you?
all right. so 
 means it's "hardly ever"? i mean, we do follow the principle of party presentation. and judges are not supposed to be intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to follow the party's presentation. so, would this be  if it's not "never," would it be at least "hardly ever," that it's appropriate for a judge to interject an affirmative defense on his own motion?
so what is your  what is your test? we have your friend saying any accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer. what  what is your proposal?
suppose i point the finger in an affidavit, and i just send the affidavit, you know. i  i don't want to get involved. i'm in a foreign country. i sign my name. i even do it under oath, and i send it right to the judge that's trying the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the judge. you don't think the confrontation clause would cover that?
what if it does say within the last 10 years.
 i would simply ask your honor to read the amicus brief by rick doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis  of medical  of cannabis for medical experimentation. and then i'd ask your honor to read the institute for medicine's report, that both the government and i  and we have relied upon in our briefs. there has been no impeachment of this report by the national academy of sciences on the medical effect. and what they say is that the  that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the  as general clement correctly pointed out. it does carry with it these ancillary harms. but when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. i'd just ask your honor to look at that, which is in the record.
well, neither does the full tax court when it 
this instruction as the oregon supreme court said, you know, doesn't provide the clarity that philip morris hoped to provide to the jury. and it says and they can't see how this summarizes philip morris' interpretation of campbell. that's in footnote 3 of the court's opinion.
and if maples' testimony had come in, i presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of maples' testimony?
right.
but, your honor, for every criminal law, injuries that are committed by those who are engaged in the criminal activity are punished as a part of that criminal act. now, justice breyer, your second 
but i am aware of  of people who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily merchant ship. now that  that i think is a common thing.
yes, justice souter, and i agree that it would be no different than submitting aggravating factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a separate instruction.
precisely.
mr. chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the ten commandments  i mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, then there are tenets to govern a society, but how much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to god?
it's in 18(a) of mine, too. maybe i have a different brief there.
wait, wait. before you leave that, do you agree that it was not raised below?
oh  oh, it does because the  because the  the first  the existence of the first amendment claim is what gives you the bivens cause of action in the first place. so otherwise, there wouldn't be any federal cause of action at all without  without the first amendment claim.
well, we do that all the time.
i thought it was consumer welfare.
mr. grant, these items we've been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case. but your argument in your brief didn't begin with those. it began with the assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review the district court's remand order at all. i take it you're not abandoning that, are you?
i don't want to jump ahead to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about the modification substantive point first, but it is not clear to me whether duke should have acted in 1980, official 1992 or 2000, or all of the above.
thank you, mr. driemeier. mr. browning, you have 8 minutes remaining.
that  it may be. i just, i don't have that ruling in front of me.
okay.
even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons. in other words, the question i asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do. it seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.
may i just ask you this question about the plain language? if the word in 1(f)(1)(a) had not been "in connection with the purchase of sale  sale of security," had been "in connection with his or her purchase or sale," then it would have been covered, would it not?
well, but 
would the case be different if they quoted section 101 in their appendix?
yes, your honor.
yes.
your honor, at the time that he made that statement, what that statement actually reflects is the pettibone rule. he was accurate in his  in his statement about what the law was governing document destruction at the time. that's a good-faith reasonable belief that was absolutely supported by the law. but, more importantly, your honor, if we look at mr. odom's remarks, he wasn't working  he wasn't  this wasn't in connection with the enron engagement; there were only, i think, ten people, out of, like, 80, at that training seminar that had anything to do with enron. he was talking about the firm's document-retention policy. the jury asked to see that videotape. they may have actually convicted andersen based upon his remarks about the document-retention policy. they, similarly, may have convicted andersen based upon nancy temple's memos that  one of which was a reminder to the engagement team that they were supposed to applying  complying with the document-retention policy. that's legal services. this 
 this, mr. lamken, that when the  when the filing is made giving us the olc opinion, you include a  an example of such a letter?
or are we just talking about the expert testimony?
i think the main reason, your honor, is that these cases aren't nelson, and that nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle, rather than trying to use in effect these cases to decide issues that are presented by a different set of facts.
do you  do you defend that the difference in  our distinction between balancing and non-balancing  or, pardon me, "weighing" and "non- weighing" states  your answer to justice breyer indicates the  that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole  the whole distinction. and isn't it true that it's paradoxical that a state which tries to structure the selection phase by giving specific factors as held to a higher standard than a state that doesn't? that seems to me very odd.
and for this court, i assume, at least theoretically, on petition for certiorari?
okay.
do we have to decide that issue here?
and you have 21 states and how many circuits 
thank you, miss smith.
yes, he was.
he would 
oh, i think absolutely because it's significantly undermines the state's overall effort in trying to get its money back because it's all well and good to say we can sell the property, but if nobody is going to pay for the property anything that comes close to the value of even getting our liens paid off, then we're not going to get the revenue stream that we would otherwise be entitled to. and even if you, you know, go through the  through the kind of machinations of 
well, i  your honor 
and  and as the court noted in amos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to single out religion, but that doesn't shield them from establishment clause scrutiny just because they take the form of being directed at religion and providing a benefit that's  that's labeled as an accommodation. i mean, for instance, congress could say, look, we think it's difficult for state prisoners to practice their religious beliefs when they can't go to church. so absent some compelling state interest and least restrictive alternatives, the prisons need to arrange to release prisoners once a week to go to the church or synagogue of their choice. well, that would provide an awfully powerful incentive inside prison walls for prisoners to  to claim religion.
this court's decision in tennard postdates the state court decisions in both of these cases. yes, your honor.
and there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security. and if i read collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' fees.
they  yes. because of the way florida operates with the total discretion and  and the refusal to give any public records regarding this, yes, we are in the dark regarding it. they could  they could alleviate that situation by doing an administrative rulemaking process, that that rule is then in place, and with that rule in place, it would be ripe at that point because at that point they're constrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the liberty to  to change the procedures as they  as they deem fit at the last minute.
thank you 
what about  what about the  the beck condition that in the absence of the instruction, there must be a choice between  the jury must be confined to a choice between death and acquittal?
and the rest of the story doesn't  doesn't put the defendant house at the time of the crime in a car. he's walking.
the patent office  none of the claims have been rejected on indefinite grounds. they have been rejected, as i understand it, certainly in this patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is all the same prior art that was presented to an article iii court here and that a jury entered a finding on. there are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be presented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a final  patent and trademark office, on the validity of a patent, contravenes something that a  a final judgment of an article iii court. but that's not this case. and we certainly agree with the united states that when  if the judgment is affirmed, the case will go back and the district court will then have to address a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is the  is the  the permanent injunction proposed by mercexchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be made specific, and this supposed work-around  does it or doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. i mean, the district judge actually found bad faith  this is page, i think, 71 of the petition appendix  of ebay in its conduct in the district court of proclaiming that for $8,000  its experts testified that for $8,000, they could work around or design around this problem and there wouldn't be an infringement. but they didn't do it. and they didn't  they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the federal circuit because their brief in the federal circuit never mentions it, and the federal circuit opinion surely would have said, they've designed around this problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or the other. even in this court, ebay has said in its  in its opening brief at page 43, here there is a possibility that the infringer can develop a work-around. well 
and all the rules of res judicata are designed to prevent two litigations and to require a single litigation. it makes no sense, in the context of a two-litigation system that this court set up, to then impose issue preclusion. otherwise, federal 
if i may, i don't think there's any question that he knew in advance that this was about the olympics. that's why he made the sign. and they were released to go out and watch the torch go by. he hasn't raised any question of notice or due process concerns.
but i assume that lawsuits are allowable if  if knock and announce is  is not observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of undress.
yes, mr. franklin. mr. minear.
where  where is that?
could you give us a collateral consequence? i mean that is 
not  i think, your honor, the flora requirement, which is a judicially interpretation on the refund statute which requires you, a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given year before it can bring a refund statute challenge, actually supports our argument here because it shows how complicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're talking about a party who doesn't owe the tax. we haven't  the government has not assessed the tax against the trust here. it believes the trust is a nominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the  the wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations for the precise reason that if we seize the property of the trust the government needs to know promptly if the trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because the government, as the chief justice indicated, will cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has already collected the tax from someone else that it believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which is different and crucially different than in a refund suit, as justice stevens alluded to, because in a refund suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in a refund or the government gets to keep the tax and that's the end of the matter. in a third party challenge, whether the third party brings it pre- deprivation or post-deprivation, the government's interest is knowing whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or not. because if it turns out that it's not the taxpayer's property the government needs to pursue the taxpayer. and congress accounted for that not only in 7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for the expression suspension of the government's period of time that it can pursue the taxpayer. the, the section 7426 expressly suspends the time period during the running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or post deprivation. in addition, the  if i can go back to justice scalia, i would like to impress upon you why we don't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable here, and not only is it because the specific controls the general when it would be wholly frustrated as it would be here by both the statute of limitations provision and its express suspension, but also because the availability of the general remedy was uncertain at the time that congress passed  and for the purposes of the implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis: what did the 1966 congress think it needed to say in order to make this the exclusive remedy? the state of the law at the time 
no, no. armstrong 
the  the record is silent as to the distance between 
10 to a dozen over how long a period of time? 20 years, 18 years?
it depends on 
a judge making that assessment.
with  regardless of whether he was ultimately correct or not, there's no question, and there's no serious argument here, that he had a legitimate basis for believing that police misconduct had occurred. he conferred with his supervisors and his colleagues before writing the memo. everyone agreed that there was a problem with the warrant. and they took his allegations so seriously that they released a defendant who had plead guilty.
sure.
i'm sorry?
but to get the real parties before the court, you have to sue them.
but they have made it that, haven't they, in a later regulation? haven't they said just that.
i think we would say, for some of the same reasons that mr. bailey has identified, that plain-error review would be inappropriate, because in order to have plain error, there has to be error. and if the gravamen of the appeal is that denial of the pre-verdict rule 50(a) motion was plain error, it can't be right, because the pre-verdict  the submission of the case to the jury is treated, as a matter of law, as a reservation of the legal questions, and it can't be plain error to reserve those questions for later decisions.
may i ask that, if you had a case in which the attorney general raised the  say, this case, and yet  and say california supreme court wrote an opinion in which it said, "now, 3 years has gone by, but the prisoner has given us a very elaborate explanation," as justice ginsburg suggested, "and we find that explanation sufficient; therefore, we conclude that, even though it was 3 years, it was a reasonable time; and, therefore, we're going to address the merits. and we now address the merits and say you lose." now, in that case, would it be pending, for our purposes?
okay. and what is your rule?
and our questions are, what is the standard for determining the constitutional violation? once we get that squared away, then we'll get to harlow.
this court has looked to both, but in associated general  associated general contractors, for instance, this court said that it's not bound by the terms of common law that existed at the time that the statute was adopted, and  but rather, that common law evolves, and so it's appropriate to  to look beyond that. i think it bears emphasis, though, that the common law of tortious interference at the time that this statute was adopted in 1866 was narrower than it is today. but even under the broader views of tortious interference, the plaintiffs concede that they would not be able to recover under those theories, and instead, have said to this court 1981 should be  go well beyond the terms of common law interference principles.
ms. smith, was the statement of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists before congress?
but the colorado statute is the one that's controlling in this case and normally, at least according to bishop against wood, we defer to the interpretation of the court of appeals as the issue of state law.
right.
but isn't that factual allegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the objection that you raise, that something more than merely the activity  the conduct of  of their separate business is going on?
as  as to the libertarians, we asked that we have a party-option open primary, which i think is acceptable, and it's what new hampshire does.
the  the problem is you're  you're trying to get a theory in response to him that i think justice kennedy is asking about.
if you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically. (laughter.)
yes. yes, your honor.
may i ask you this question about your position: we are trying to find cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this court. do you include in that group of cases, cases such as berger against the united states, and viereck against the united states, which were direct review of federal cases in which they say there was a denial of the fair trial, but they're not setting aside state cases? would it be proper for the court of appeals to rely on those cases?
if you  if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the claims court?
well, as  if  if that's the question, i  i would defer to  to michigan counsel 
thank you, mr. stris. mr. coleman, we'll hear from you.
may i ask this question? is the fee payable before the  a carrier may engage in business or is it after the carrier has paid? is it  is it like a tax that's paid after the year is out?
yes, but the authority is broader than the authority to search for those items.
right. and as i understand your view 
it's going to give states a license to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be protected under the statute.
pursuant to a plan to acquire a monopoly.
well 
 a result of the removal.
thank you, mr. dreeben. mr. reichel.
yes, your honor. the  we believe the record strongly shows that. for example, there was a mayoral election in burlington run under these limits during the time that the case was 
 "pursuant to" 
no. well, after all  if you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on appeal.
but all of that occurred, as i  correct me if i'm wrong on the facts, but i thought all of that occurred prior to  i don't know what they call it in illinois, but prior to a bind-over hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of causation between what the police do and the subsequent incarceration.
i think a reasonable interpretation of those statements could be that the duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose the death penalty.
if  if it's not confined to fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the other side that all  all (2) is really doing is saying that if you are going to establish your damages by reference to market price, this is the way you've got to do it. you've got to go through this mean price analysis and so on. but they are saying we are not simply trying to establish our damages by reference to the market, and therefore we're not bound by  and therefore, (e)(2), in effect, is  is irrelevant. what  what is your answer?
it's not jurisdictional, exactly, justice souter. this is a jurisdictional ruling. and that's all that this court granted certiorari on.
mr. clement, can i ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? as i understand it, it's the protestant version basically of the ten commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the catholic version and the jewish version. and i understand it was the result of consultation and so forth. but i noticed in your brief, you list the states in which the ten commandments displays are listed, there is none for rhode island, which i often think of as primarily a catholic state, and the only one from massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it. is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of christian religions?
mr. shapiro, is there any evidence in this record that the special trial judge in fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?
all right. if that's right 
yes, your honor.
that's one factor that i point to among several to 
justice scalia, i think that's exactly what the statute  the statutes  the three read together and enforced together 
i'm  i'm not aware of any. there may have been a few state banks that had interstate branches, although they would have been citizens only of the state of their incorporation.
no. all right 
didn't  didn't the michigan supreme court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?
and  and the flip side of that is there's nothing that indicates why even  even the person  if somebody is unwilling to go  to take the time to find out what the commissioner of lands in the state has sent a certified letter for, why is it  why would you assume that whenever the letter comes in when it's addressed to mr. jones, that mrs. jones isn't going to toss it aside just as quickly?
this is all step one?
well, where i believe it gets you, as this court has recognized, there is a very meaningful difference between acknowledging something and endorsing something. for example, the creche in lynch or the menorah in allegheny.
oh, that's  that's good, not bad. i mean, you know.
what's your response to the fact that the tenth circuit found otherwise and that we usually defer?
yes.
they don't even have to say my  my religion requires me not to eat this food. they just say, you know, i'm 
in terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law, there is no difference.
whatever you call it, call it a health exception, call it an xyz exception. they knew what they were getting at, they knew what they were worried about and they said, we will have a statute without it or we will have no statute.
did the earlier process that you described, the basic research, is that within the common law research exemption?
i would agree with you.
i don't think it was a point of the court's analysis at all.
well then, let me change justice 
if you started up the ladder and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that would be a potential risk. whether it's a serious potential risk under taylor, it is not as clear.
but we can remand for that. what's here is, the ninth circuit held that there's liability based on what the liability of a state agent would be, and that's just not the rule.
and you know, justice kennedy, i understand that. but the reality is we raised the doctrine of equivalence as our question presented. the other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its pages for the issue of the meaning of rogers. we answer that in the reply brief. the court grants certiorari. we decided under those circumstances that the sensible way to proceed was to address the rogers issue. now, to be sure, i suppose we could have said, here's  section one is the doctrine of equivalence. that's a 10 page brief. maybe the better way to do it is just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief on rogers, and then 20 pages on rogers. but we anticipated that they were going to do precisely what they did, which is 
i think it is a risk.
no, what  it did not seek to undo the judgment in smith. what the court was  what congress was responding to was the  what it understood to be the test. it reinstated the compelling-interest test, but specifically said it was not disagreeing with the outcome of any particular case under that prior test. and three of those cases  hernandez, concerning the tax code; lee, concerning the social security act; and braunfeld, regarding the sunday closing laws  were all ones that adopted the approach that i have suggested.
well, i just went off what the date on the  the handwritten date on the pleading we received from the court. it said february 10, so we just put it in there. didn't go to the actual docket to see if, in fact, it was entered. as you can see, orders were not  in this case were not entered on date that the judge signified anyway.
justice ginsburg has a question i'm very interested in. do you defend the fobian rule?
right.
well, justice o'connor, let me first say that i think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with california law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. and, of course, the controlled substances act is concerned, at almost every step of the act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under schedule i into the national market.
why? really?
 later.
excuse me. i'm looking at page 92 of the joint appendix. i don't, i don't see that.
i think the distinction is similar to an aldinger/kenosha type distinction. and i think the question goes back to it requires an interpretation of whether or not congress wanted to give the lower federal courts the type of jurisdiction being discussed.
i believe that centers more around the causation and foreseeability issues that are triggered by that type of a claim.
yes.
in the habeas proceeding, it's  it's  an argument could have been made and, indeed, was made in this case that the line  that under atkins juvenile offenders are the same and 
right.
what i was thinking is  i mean, here a judge  i guess she was harried in the trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is there any evidence here that this was less than the shotgun  this was not a shotgun. you know, it had to be a barrel less than 16 inches. so is there any evidence here of the shotgun? and she, i guess, forgot that there was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. now, there aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. so she's thinking, something may be missing here. she's a little uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my god, there was all that evidence about the pistol. so i shouldn't have done that. i mean, how  how is a judge like that, a hypothetical  what's she supposed to do? is she supposed to say, i better not enter anything, because after all, i don't care if the defendant has to produce a case? or is she supposed to enter something and think, well, i could change my mind before it's over? or what is she supposed to do? she just thinks she made a mistake.
may i just switch gears for a moment, because your time is almost up, and we  you haven't addressed the mootness problem in toledo-flores.
now, there's no record here of the colloquy at the plea? is that it?
both sullivan and shaare tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases. right?
not if it could be considered as to going to the element, no. but that's not this case.
i agree, your honor. it may be that the  the noise alone could justify the circumstance. certainly we wouldn't want a test that excluded words only 
the constitution protects us in the sense that it allows us to rebut and respond and reply to evidence offered by the state in aggravation of a sentence of death. and if they're offering evidence that he is  he acted deliberately, we have a right to respond to that. we don't have to sit there with our hands tied behind our back.
yes, it was. it was raised on remand from this court.
right. so that  but you're saying to justice breyer then is they have waived the $10 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are plated in michigan because they've already charged them $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being plated.
yes.
well, but then at that point in time, maples, maples' conviction  maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant.
yes, justice ginsburg, they should have knocked. they should have made that effort first.
well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in b requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in a, especially if it makes no difference.
the manual had said there are certain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on the jury. you don't want black jurors. you don't want women jurors. you don't want jewish jurors. you don't want fat ones. you don't want bearded ones. and these are the things that they were noting. isn't the reasonable inference that that's what they were noting them for?
well, but he did not know that for years later. i mean, they don't have to bring a prosecution immediately. they can wait until the day before the statute of limitations runs.
and the person who did the reliance was you, i guess?
okay, but do you  do you agree that direct economic effect cannot be the only criterion here?
let me cite the court to the eleventh circuit's own reasoning in the adams case. and that case involves a misdemeanant where the officer intentionally made contact with the vehicle several times. the last contact caused the death of a passenger. the eleventh circuit found that garner did not apply to that situation and further said that a policeman's use of his vehicle is very different from a policeman's use of his gun.
 because all they'd have to do is don't use it in ph soil.
temporal, geographic, the identities, but where does it set forth anything evincing an agreement other than the allegation of parallel conduct?
yes, i think what i'm  with all due respect, i think what i'm telling the court is that the practice should be, as it has been the last 25 years, that you do not allow cures of edwards versus arizona by the police intentionally violating one's rights and then attempting to cure it. but, if this court finds that there can be a cure, we want to participate in what would be a proper cure.
he 
but with respect to 
the standard is unreasonable in light of clearly established law.
well, i hope that if the court does not choose to decide the question on which it granted certiorari, that it does hold that the ninth circuit's substantive rule of law here is incorrect, and that there was nothing wrong with the indictment.
general kline, can i ask you this question? supposing the law was that you're supposed to be instructed that, "unless the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors, the sentence shall be death." would that be permissible?
well, there may be  there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element, but there may be other crimes where it wouldn't. and  and i don't understand your argument to be  is it that in every case duress negates an element of the crime or only in some cases?
the respondent had asked the bankruptcy court  after reading our brief, the respondent asked the bankruptcy court to dismiss 
after identifying them in terms of the expenditures or revenues. that's what you're supposed to do.
no, but the dilation protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?
my concern with your argument is it's not just the anatomical line. the statute, i guess the solicitor general referred to this as the multiple mens rea requirement. it's not simply the extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but with the purpose of demise at that point. so, if in the typical d&e the demise is going to be accomplished before extraction passed the anatomical landmark. it wouldn't be covered by this law.
and if there was a second  the same defendant got convicted again for crime x. at that sentencing the judge could again take into account the harm to defendants b, c, and d.
what i would say is in either case it's bad. i would say that there is taxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds outside the government but not your horrible hypothetical about an internal government church.
that one died, your honor, with the court's ruling.
at what point was this inserted into the record, mr. layton?
to  to be waters of the united states, they would have to have a hydrological connection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters of the united states.
but if you look at the way it was used in pickering, which, of course, is a different case  but, in pickering, the court was emphasizing that public employees, like all citizens, have an interest in speaking on a matter of public concern. the court, in connick, suggested that if the prosecutor there had spoken to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust, her speech would have presumptively been protected. if she had done that, she'd be speaking in the same capacity that ceballos spoke here. one can readily imagine a concerned citizen stepping forward to expose government misconduct. and it can be difficult to sort out in which capacity an employee is speaking. and sometimes an employee can speak in more than one capacity at once.
the  the version that  that was referred to earlier, your honor, came out of the senate bill. the senate bill contained a number of very controversial features. it was pared down, and the word cost was substituted, as the drafter of the language made clear on the floor of the senate before the senate voted on its version of the bill, and senator weicker's explanation of what the word cost means could not be clearer, and he  he 
no. the question was what about the 
i don't believe in all of the cases that both parties cited that there are any cases in which this court has said that there was no impediment to the third party. it is  it is certainly not the standard 
right. and then  and  and the point here is this was thought out. it wasn't thought out as disparate treatment versus disparate impact because the concepts didn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as arbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that adversely bear on older workers. the prohibitions went to arbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse impacts. it was the  the non-coercive measures that went to the adverse impacts. let me go also 
but if we accept that in the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable jurisdiction, or  it's something i made up, i suppose  is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to  in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting?
as a matter of damages, i think all appropriate relief would be the standard. but as a matter of attorney's fees, i think is a good example of why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law is 100 percent clear, from this court's decision in alyeska and other cases, that where congress hasn't provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting authorized. that's what they intended.
wouldn't a district judge who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say: well, i'll wait; this petition will be held pending the supreme court's disposition of cert.
this is my 
no, i think that would be impermissible
and the issue would be, i assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free lunch.
that's right.
no, i don't think such a statistic 
i'm asking you, who is the real corporation or person in interest that lincoln property is a kind of sham or front for?
aided and abetted.
i really have no idea, your honor. i really have no idea.
the states 
it's certainly not enforceable in an appellate court. that's correct.
 for future reference by  by congress.
i mean, it is conceivable that federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway.
 presumpscot river.
right.
no.
yes.
what  what other sorts of torts would this apply to, as applied to chatham county? if chatham county 
well, what  what you're saying is that an  an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. and there is simply no authority for that proposition.
well, they're protecting him for a protection purpose. his trip is for a religious purpose. and i think our submission is that there is a distinction that can be drawn there.
correct, justice scalia.
under this statute.
i mean, this is an appalling situation.
i think that  well, certainly it's testimonial, and so 
yes.
but if you don't tell us what issue remains, i don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.
 states diverge. such as  palliative care, i think, is the most obvious example. these days, there is a great deal of divergence among the states as to how 
yes, we do.
well, i  i suppose that 
yeah, i mean, you don't 
mr. wray.
yes, sir.
in the chair?
and if they want to pass a law that says that, because of the  because there's a domestic 
yes.
i 
your honor, quite frankly, we can't determine that  that statement rests on anything. the undisputed evidence in the record consists of a photograph of the blood samples at the time they were received by the defense expert. the box was opened. a photograph was taken. the photograph shows clearly that one entire tube of blood is missing and the second tube of blood has leaked within the packaging. but the record also contains the testimony of the tbi agent who transported the blood from the fbi to the defense expert who said he observed no blood that leaked other than the  other than what was inside the container. it also contains the testimony of the fbi agent who tested the blood at the fbi who said two things. one, i used no  no more than one quarter of a tube of blood and that no blood spilt while the tube was in the possession of the fbi.
that may  that may be so.
i think the statute, read as a whole, compels that conclusion. but if i'm wrong about that, and if there is enough ambiguity to admit of a different conclusion, then the principle comes into play that cases of ambiguity in the robinson-patman act are construed to be more consistent with the overall 
yes, your honor, and many courts have held that  well, the miranda rights pretty much encompasses these rights, but they're different. these are standalone rights, and what's critical about this, what's really important is that for every united states citizen who's arrested  and typically interrogation is going to follow quickly on the heels of the arrest  they're giving the miranda warnings. and essentially they have three options. they can speak to the police. they can invoke the right to silence, or they can invoke the right to an attorney. however, foreign nationals have a fourth option and that fourth option is they can have the consulate contacted, if they want. and the consulate provides different kinds of information and support for the arrestee. and it's  what's critical is  what's hard to see is that because we're in this country, we don't see it, but if you're overseas and you've been arrested  let's say you're in damascus and you're given a dime and your options are to call the local attorney provided by your jailers or the american consulate. and i think it's pretty clear that most people are going to call the american consulate. why? it's because there's a kind of a familiarity. there's an attraction there. there's an appeal. there's security. you're dealing with the known. whereas, a local attorney, it's the unknown, and it's provided by the local authorities.
mr. stewart, if  if we're going to tweak the statute, isn't the least possible tweak  and perhaps not a tweak at all  simply to consider this a personnel action?
generally, no, your honor.
well, if it were what the record reflected and there was a relevant market that was  that was restricted to this ink, yes. but we don't think that the existence of a patent, even in the requirements context, fulfills that test for the reason that the economic literature is quite clear that price discrimination, which is what their theory  their  their theory is metering should be sufficient to give rise to a presumption because price discrimination supposedly signals market power. but as we discuss in our reply brief, there is a tremendous amount of economic literature that says that is in fact not true, that price discrimination occurs in very competitive markets from airlines to restaurants to coupons.
surely it is possible to conceive of facts under which they would not have not conspired and they would have had a different motive, but that's not the legal standard under conley versus gibson.
 such a rule.
oh, yes. under these two decisions of the court, nasd and gordon, there has to be active supervision or pervasive regulation by the agency, and then a direct conflict with what the sec is trying to accomplish. there are a number of things that can be regulated even under the antitrust laws under those standards. nasd and gordon didn't stop all antitrust litigation in its tracks. only things that were within the agency's supervisory jurisdiction to present 
 why would you deal with that hypothetical when the eleventh circuit, in all fairness, said, "we join the second, fourth, fifth, and ninth circuit, and rule that, even though the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the district court may review the timeliness of the 2254." that's what  the question that the court thought it was deciding.
 the answer is 
thank you, mr. stewart. ms. mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.
that would depend on the vehicle 
yes. i think it's 
well, if a proceeding is  yes, we would, in this case. yes, absolutely. but, you know, if a proceeding is pending, then it changed the  changes the way that you apply the definition of "corruptly." but you're certainly right that the definition is the same. the question is, under the proper definition of "corruptly," did you induce the witnesses to engage in this activity through improper means, such as bribery, or did you try to get them to violate their independent legal duties? for instance, if they had duties, under section 1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because what you have done is, you have asked the witness to engage in conduct which violates the law, and that corrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of the statute, it fits with the structure.
okay? what would happen?
okay. don't tell me it's right if it's not right is all i want 
no. there is a presumption under our law 
yes. and the ninth circuit simply didn't reach that issue.
i don't think we're disagreeing. what i want to do is distinguish those from the case we have here, and go back to justice souter's 
and, in that context 
but they can drive if their parents agree. my  my 
that's one way to look at it. another way would be you would allow a relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud that causes the government to examine the books and uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis. it's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional prerequisite determined only after the case is over.
but answer his question. give him an example of where it  it wouldn't be harmless error.
it's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note.
means.
sure. two sources. one would be professor lefave in his discussion of what the intent required for the different theft offenses; and the second source would be the model penal code when it sets forth the requisite mens rea for theft offenses.
mr. bergeron, i have a basic conceptual problem, both with that response and with your larger argument. leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand, the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's benefit. the conceptual problem i have is that i don't understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural  or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents. we give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart. you're saying one person has a substantive right, the other people have procedural right. and i don't see conceptually how you can make that split. and if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public  the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone. so conceptually, how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another?
see, you could  there are two things in rose v. lundy, and everybody agrees with the one, you must exhaust in state court. you cannot have the federal court take a first view of that question. you  you must exhaust. and  but then rose v. lundy also said without prejudice, and your reading strikes out without prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the district court more than the limitation period just to sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.
an issue letter.
 the other case, he's making the statement as a member of the public. and what the first amendment is all about is that we allow stupid statements to be made. right?
can you think of any machine  can you think of any machine other than a computer that has a component that is not a physical thing?
that's also true of (b)(3).
but, of course, it's premeditation. if there were evidence, say, for example 
the answer was put in, and then there were no further proceedings. nothing else went on in the court.
if such a  if such a process could be put in place where there was an appellate panel that would be willing and available to hear that while the jury remained empaneled, i don't think it would run afoul of the double jeopardy clause.
no, your honor. i'm saying several things. as i said earlier, first, this court in chambers v. marsh said that there was a unique history to legislative prayers. there isn't a similar history here.
and, apparently, you didn't sue the right people until you replied to me. then i took your argument, because it seemed like seven arguments, mixed up, and i took that argument to be the following. i'm  i, the plaintiff, sued a defendant, who is called the lincoln property company. now, i grant you, there is some evidence that that defendant, the one i sued, is a texas corporation. one, they showed us the certificate of incorporation, or they got a sworn statement. two, in my complaint, i said that's what he was. however, there is some evidence the other way. on page 179 and 181, we have a person named mr. franzen who says, "i am the senior president, vice president, partner for defendant lincoln property company," in which case, if that's your argument, you're telling us  is that your argument, that there is some evidence the real defendant, whom i sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent evidence to the contrary?
 26.
well, i think we have to read the definitional regulations together. that is, all of the terms in the exemption, companionship services, babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service employment, are all defined in the set of regulations, point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. and it is clear from the prefatory language of each one that what the department of labor intended to do was define the terms in the statute. and so when it said that that term refers to 
is it possible it violates section 2, the following? we look at the map as it's drawn. we ask the question, is there a way to redraw this map so that, say, the minority group has a more significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera, et cetera? gingles. answer: of course, there is. it's the old way. and you say, well, why didn't you do it the old way? well, the only reason you didn't do it the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a sufficient justification.
but was there  there was a reporter who was one of the disabled people, i think, wasn't there, in tennessee versus lane?
justice souter  i believe a number of answers to that, justice kennedy. first of all, this is so temporary. they've done this for  they have the right to get out of this in 5 years. they're already out of it. it doesn't exist anymore. they could do it mutually in 5 years. they could do it by themselves after 5. they haven't done it anywhere else in the world. all they're doing is getting together and being able to fix the price. so it's so temporary. what difference does  really does that make? but, in addition, it's the profit pooling that was also illegal, declared to be illegal by this court in its 7 to 1 decision in citizens.
and there are many  maybe justice scalia has the answer.
well, suppose the court of appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in the sentencing reform act. would there be a problem there?
if the requisite effect on competition is shown, yes.
well, what do you say to the response 
yes, it is.
i mean, i  i guess he deals with these associations all the time, so we should  we should listen to him, but  but he  he is not authoritative as to  as to who comes into court, is he?
so, even 
may i 
that's one of the subsections of 922(g)(5). anybody who's an illegal alien here illegally can't have a gun. anyone 
thank you, mr. barnett. general clement, you have four minutes.
that may be the closest private-person analog. in that situation, however, when one goes to apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking about a private security guard. one would ask the questions whether the guard had the requisite authority. and the state would look to what that guard's authority was. and often states would look  if the guard happened to be a federal officer, would look to federal law. and that can be appropriate, i think, for  under, potentially, three different  for, potentially, three different reasons. one, the language of the defense in 2680(a), which provides the united states with a defense to liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're carrying out a federal statute or regulation. it  another source of authority might be the state-law principles simply look to what the authority of the person doing the conduct is, and then you would look to federal law for the source of that authority. and that could be right, under this court's suggestion in muniz, that federal regulations  once an actionable duty is established under state tort principles, one can look to federal regulations to determine whether or not  what the applicable standard of 
i don't.
well, one of my responses is that the tribe is located entirely within the state. the record is clear that most of the fuel purchased at that station is used on highways paid for by kansas. an overwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on a reservation road; its used on the highways of the state of kansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino. the road that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long. the rest of the driving, according to the record, is on the highways of kansas. so, there's a clear difference there. when you sell  when the distributors market fuel in nebraska 
right.
okay. well, let  if we can return to the facts of this case, i think these  we fit comfortably within the definition of "transaction," because both of the rights that mr. felix is asserting in this habeas petition are trial rights. under this court's decision in chavez versus martinez, in this court's decision in pennsylvania versus ritchie, both the fifth amendment and the sixth amendment rights are trial rights. those statements, independently, when they were taken by the same police officer, did not violate any rights. they only violated mr. felix's rights when they were introduced in the  in the prosecution's case in chief.
there is not. it's the statutory language of the deadly weapon enhancement itself.
well, it isn't even clear here that beck would have been violated. as i understand it, in  in mississippi the jury could have given a sentence less than death despite the conviction. isn't that right?
 $22 a head. and that 
well, i think it  i think it's important to distinguish between two different types of delay. what was at issue in oneida i and oneida ii was delay in bringing the underlying lawsuit. and, even in that context, the court said that the suit was not barred entirely, but equitable factors might be taken into account in formulating an appropriate remedy. here, we don't have delay in filing a lawsuit. that is, nobody doubts that the tribes asserted their right to a tax exemption promptly after repurchasing the relevant lands. the argument on the other side is that their delay in purchasing the land should be analogized to 
thank you, mr. gornstein. mr. friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
no.
oh, really?
i saw that argument. i have to say i don't understand it. why is it so difficult? i get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate.
well, this court in welsh indicated that minor offenses  you couldn't rely on the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is what it suggested. but certainly an assault, under utah law, is a class b misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient gravity to justify officers entering.
i think when you get to the 
is  is this mercy instruction always given? is that standard? is it  is it, in effect, that  that mercy is  is always one of the mitigating circumstances?
well, what about  do you think the facts in the presentence report are admitted by your opponent or not?
absolutely, your honor. from  the conception behind operating subsidiaries was to separate a certain part of the business and the attendant risks of that business also to separate.
under blackhawk, it would be  it would  it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be  be directed in any particular manner. now, there are some provisions in the 
who said he was not supposed to do these things?
what if they still conclude, as they did before, that when these aggravating factors are found, unless there is mitigation to overcome them, it is the judgment of the people of kansas that this person is deserving of death? what if they come to that conclusion again? you want us to tell them, "no, the people of kansas cannot come to that, what seems to me, quite rational decision"?
it would have said that that isn't pending under federal law, whether california says it or not. so, the role of the federal law versus the state law, i thought we left open.
how does that help you? because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party. so how does the last sentence help you?
thank you, mr. waxman. mr. phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining.
yes, there are a lot of provisions in the plra that may prevent him from actually attending, but  [laughter.]
thank you very much, mr. shelley. the case is submitted.
that's what the united states believes the limit of the exception is, and the  let me be clear. the united states has a strong interest in having this court clarify the exception. that is where the confusion lies in the court of appeals. that is where the united states feels like its interests are at risk. so although the petitioner's claim is well outside the exception, the united states' interests lie in having the court clear up the confusion and reject the sweeping and expansive view of the probate exception that the ninth circuit has announced.
well, the question would be if he's 
i believe that was  i keep, i've been switching back and forth between calendar days and court days. so forgive me. i believe that was on the eighth court day. and at that point, when they announced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and deliberated the case.
but, so far, your theory is based on economics, as i've heard it.
mr. wycoff, you have about 4 minutes left.
it covers damage, for one thing.
well, but reasonably criticized for it. i would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, been given a very expansive reading. and you don't need to say that the fcc has to do what typically i would have thought was a job for a court, which is to determine whether there's a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable. i would have thought the contact point was what i was talking about with mr. fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is  which is, again, i suppose, something that the agency gets deference on. but it would seem to official me, that's where the limitation would come.
what are you referring to, then?
they would just say it doesn't preempt.
this is by no means a trumped-up suit. it's a very serious suit. the outcome, the judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not a matter of wager. it depends upon the decision of a matter of law of an interpretation of a statute of the united states.
and the employer goes ahead and turns it over?
raise it up.
that is correct.
because, i think the difference is that when somebody is denied a promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks themselves are not discriminatory. they treat similarly situated workers differently.
suppose, in the coco-quinine case, the non  the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, "you know, i'm going to cut into that market, and i'm going to use the term coco-quinine. and i'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder." is that good faith?
your honor, that is not the case. the  the rule that we seek to preserve has been the way courts have interpreted this provision since 1988. that's 
i  i wasn't suggesting that they had 15th and 16th century cases in mind. certainly not. i was relying on those cases because great-west mandates that that's what we do. but i do believe that 
that is true, justice kennedy.
yes. no.
well, whether it would have come in 
and if they came out the other way and said, i am going to treat it as preclusive, because the supreme court says you don't have to have a right to appeal, we'd be stuck with that.
why would  i find it difficult to understand why congress wouldn't have wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come in before iirira. bear in mind, these are people who have been deported once, already deported once, and then, in violation of the law, come back in again. and there was a regime for deporting them, which allowed certain variations, which are eliminated by iirira, permission for them to stay. you really think congress wanted to keep faith with the people who had, already have  having been deported once for illegal reentry  - illegal entry  come in again  and you think congress says, "oh, well, you know, we have to keep faith with these people who are violating our law, and not  and not deport them except under the conditions that existed when they broke the law to reenter"? i find that a very  what should i say?  touching  [laughter.]
you ask him what his name is. why don't you ask him whether he's an american citizen? if he says no, say what country are you a citizen of. i mean, i  i don't see the difficulty of that.
 so you're saying that there's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this case, he has a  he has a defense if he said, "well, it's my duty to call it as i see it"?
no, but he mentioned that there was  he mentioned cohen.
if the physical 
why  why are there thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of case? what  what incentives do noncapital defendants have to drag it on?
i think they would be offered some level of protection, justice souter, through summary judgment. the problem is summary judgment offers its own unique hurdles to a defendant. and again, it's a difference 
the protection that criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes particular findings, will then be no longer applicable.
is that analogous to the source and the compilation, the source being the design, the compilation being the key?
it 
no, no, no, no. justice kennedy, all i'm saying is 
i would think it's an a fortiori case, in other words.
and, otherwise, why should  why would she go through these ventures?
thank you, mr. zagrans.
to understand why this came in, it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied only to incontestable marks. it did not apply to other registered marks. at that time, incontestable mark holders did not have to prove likelihood of confusion. that incontestable mark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. same mark, on the same goods that were set forth in the affidavit with the pto. that was akin to early common law. at that point, the plaintiff could go into court with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive evidence. so there had to be a safety valve for defendants to be able to say, "okay, i know this is an incontestable mark, i know that, and i know i'm using it on the same goods, but notwithstanding, i can use it because i'm using it fairly, i'm not confusing consumers with this. that's what the purpose was. in 19 
yes, but in a  in a private action for securities fraud, loss causation is an element of the cause of action. it's not an element in every fraud case.
yes, your honor.
so it should say influenced rather than determined.
so you're saying it's only conclusive if it's right?
could you just say a word about the  the ditch  sorry  the word about the wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-made object like a ditch? are there many such instances? it sounds to me like a scientific question. are there many such instances where there is no transfer of water? and in those instances, is the presence of water in the wetland anything more than a coincidence?
thank you, mr. gornstein. ms. forsman?
you think it would, okay.
i presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations. if we have done everything we can to reduce co2, you know, what deal do we make with foreign nations? what incentive do they have to go along with us?
there's amendment all the time in the majority of circuits that have applied the government's test, and it comes up in two scenarios 
well, as we point out in a footnote in our brief there was some education finance experts that suggested there would be no reason to retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and i think that's because when you have low per-pupil revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures. but the important point is the material important part of the language, which is 95th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state, is exactly what the secretary proposed and the secretary of course wouldn't have curtailed his own discretion to continue the same methodology that he had long had in place. thank you.
your honor, congress wanted to compress certainly the time between exhaustion of the state remedies and the time when the petitioner came to federal court. however, congress gave unlimited tolling while there is any proceeding going in  in state court. i  i see this stay and abeyance as a procedure that gets applied somewhat infrequently and at the discretion of a judge to  a district court judge to apply or not apply when it's appropriate to 
and that qualifies under the amount-in-controversy.
you're right.
i have to concede that that's true, and if that is the uniformity that we seek and the only 
well, in the same way that the federal government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, i think california is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.
if you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has. that's not what the statute says.
in a number of instances, yes, your honor. again, the  the way that we think that class action cases should be resolved is the same way that  that these issues are approached in all cases, which is to look at the type of relationship that exists between the  the client and the attorney to see whether the payment is made in  in response to a debt owed by the client and also to look to the degree of control that the client has over the  the underlying source of income. and in this context, it is 
 a six-month difference is a 50-percent extension of the limitations period, which is a big deal. and congress wanted a 
your honor, i don't think we would ever 
that  the statutes say that parole is a  is a transitional period, and that every inmate should undergo a period of parole. but coming back to your earlier question, the court has said that the condition of a parolee is very different from the condition of a prisoner. the court said that in morrissey against brewer. and the court said, in griffin, as to probationers, that while the fourth amendment rights of probationers  and so, parolees, too, we concede  are reduced, there are  the state can go too far. and if the state exceeds 
justice alito, i do, as far as it goes, accept that as a baseline. i think judge bea in a separate dissent likened it to a family wedding, that we all know who is here for which party. that we have no quarrel with.
i'm actually, justice o'connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition to that district court's finding because there was an ongoing purpose to retain this now historical monument that has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national and historic landmark.
you know, the  the  there are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors that filed a brief written by professor lemley in support of ebay in this case. professor lemley testified under oath to congress that, even though there are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a willful infringer, the law  equity doesn't balance private harms. but even if that were wrong, i acknowledge that in balancing, there may be cases in which you can show a vastly disproportionate harm. okay? i mean, the other side has amicus briefs that come up with these hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one little aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000 components to it. note, a, that all of those are hypothetical, and b, i'll explain why it's a problem of extremely limited circumstances. but, of course, equity courts can decide that, just as they can decide whether the  the, quote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches, unclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable considerations that aren't captured by this formulaic four-factor test but that equity courts, including district courts sitting under  under 283, consider. but this is not the case of some profligate licensor. this is somebody who has licensed with specific provisions. the other side says, well, there are no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the autotrader license, which is one of our examples, is in fact invalid. that came up in their reply brief. it is not correct. it is absolutely true that ebay will not  the '265 patent is included by that license. it relates to the field of use of auto sales. it provides specifically that ebay  that mercexchange cannot receive royalties unless it enforces this patent within the field of use. there is no doubt that  that mercexchange will not be able to start getting patent royalties from autotrader unless and until it obtains this injunction. and for example 
that  that is correct, your honor, and there have been courts that have held that with respect 
on its own, it clearly wouldn't suffice. the court has decided that a long time  i mean, that is mullane. but i think as an  as an additional component, if you  if you really want to get into the totality of the circumstances rather than what i think is the better rule, which is to say, as you evaluate what we did, was it reasonably calculated to provide notice, and conclude, yes, it was reasonably calculated to provide notice under this court's rulings that mailing is an appropriate way to proceed, i think we would win there. if you go beyond that and say, well, no, you have to do something-plus, if you go down the reasonably diligent efforts kind of an approach, i would say then don't go any further than say that you're required to publish the fact of the sale itself because to go beyond that is  is to open this. and  and we've already seen this 
it is directed 
well, no, there  official
so let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like  i mean, as long as they're using just the word "micro color," i see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. but what about when they use something that looks like a mark?
but if no one has ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to construe this charging document which charges him as a principal as actually meaning to charge him as an accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?
what's your  what's your answer to mr.  mr. mills' position that the government has, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by creating one class of excludables?
i think that's exactly what they have to be arguing. and it seems to me that that cannot be what 307(b)(1) means. justice kennedy, you asked a great question. should we have raised this in 1980, 1992, 2000? when were we supposed to bring this up? and the truth is in 1980 we interpreted this statute, the regulation, exactly the same way epa did. it would have been silly for us to raise that. it is true that this issue comes up 25 years later in a bizarre proceeding. but that's not what 307(b)(2) is all about. it says you are precluded from making a challenge in an enforcement action if the action of the administrator was subject to challenge. well, the action of the administrator was not subject to challenge in 1980. and when we did have the subsequent rulemaking 
well, this court in schroeder v. city of new york, i think, recognized that it's impossible to have a mechanical rule to apply in every circumstance. i do think, though, that the 
no. they referred to other claims, your honor, but they don't refer to antitrust. so we don't believe 
 which are at least consistent. what would i do with this case? that's my problem.
strawbridge has become less hallowed in light of the new congressional enactment. what's it called? the sunshine in class action? what is it?
you  you were in the midst of telling us why the  there is a consensus now that it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and i  i  you weren't 
and as to 23, do you want this court to say that it's constitutionally permissible to take away a number of minority voters from the district, but leave just enough so that it looks like a minority? is that a permissible use of race? it  it seems to me that's an affront and an insult.
for a small dealer. but as we've already heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are prices like target and wal-mart. those aren't small dealers. those are behemoths in the retailing industry.
well, what about my hypothetical?
and they have said the same, you tell us, as to federal courts.
i'm not sure  i'm not sure i follow the 
yes.
yes, your honor. but circumventing the application to the trial judge 
at that point when the court makes that examination under your rule and it comes to point six 
no, your honor. we think that what it is to do is to give effect to the traditional presumption of regularity, which is, ultimately  if you do have a tie, whose judgment ought to be given effect? and under the statute, where congress recognized that state and local governments would retain the primary authority over educational decisions  and in the rowley case, where this court reaffirmed that  we think that, combined with the traditional presumption of regularity  which is that the actions and decisions of public officials are presumed to be taken in good faith, and presumed to be correct  those factors counsel strongly in favor of the traditional rule here. petitioners 
there are, your honor.
well 
yes.
right.
well, i think there's no reason to suspect that there's going to be abuse in which parties are going to come in and make frivolous arguments that an entire line of business is illegal and then  and that that's going to cause a flood gate of cases into courts because courts have, with rule 11 and other similar rules, a lot of ways of getting rid of those.
i'll be happy to participate in that conversation. and this is how we believe that taint can be cured, if at all. number one, you put the suspect back in the position that he was in before the violation occurred. how do you do that? this is a violation of a right to counsel. not a right to remain silent; a right to counsel. the suspect asked for counsel. the best way to cure it is, give him counsel. how else do you cure it? you tell him that he no longer  "we were wrong when we told you, you face the death penalty."
thank you, mr. boynton. mr. stewart, we'll hear from you.
there is definiteness, there is enablement, there is written description. we think all of those are contravened here.
i paraphrased, your honor. (laughter.)
okay.
well, at  at that point the income wouldn't have inured to the benefit of the attorney.
why isn't that this case? i don't understand.
mr. shanmugam, several of the emergency death proceedings we've had involving this question, the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution, as this one was. is that option available to the district court in this case if it's sent back?
if they sent the golden disk abroad or if the microsoft engineer 
okay. that's  that's what i think you should say.
 limitations, one of the aspects of this mismatches  that in one case you went back as much as  there was a 7-month differential. is there a timeframe, if we adopt your theory, about  in which you can engage in this comparison?
well, 1983 is a good example. if you have a  a treaty between a state and the federal government, a spending clause provision, that says you've got to spend the money this way, give certain rights to the individuals, we don't always automatically hold that the individuals have enforceable rights even under 1983.
this is a case, am i correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case? and there was a harmless  and the testimony of maples was she had seen a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?
well, that has nothing to do with violence or not. it has to do with directness or not. you're saying you would apply the same directness test.
because of the cronic point.
he would be an applicant for admission, and the  i  i believe  i believe i'm correct on that.
well, ultimately the case is about the language of the statute and whether the court should apply it as written. and i think 
 you had this same officer before you, my goodness, i  i wouldn't remember it.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
but that's not 
yes.
so, under your 
in 
well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a "weighing" state, that there's  that the process is defective. would you carry over that same argument just as one component of the harmless-error analysis?
no, they do not. and they've flatly rejected that and found cases where there's  several years' delay, even in the capital context, to be reasonable. but 
as the ping amicus brief, the ping golf club manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy like leegin it's more efficient to do it in many circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without further discussion for discounting one item in order to keep your policy in place.
how many  how many times has the icj held that, that a treaty, apart from being contract between the signers, confers individual rights?
yes, but it might be much simpler to rely on 1 u.s. code, section 3 and our  our definition, as we've described it there, and then deal with other situations within the framework of the definition of seaman and the other issues that arise. and it seems like the first circuit went backwards from chandris back to giovanni which basically had been rejected. so that's the concern.
i don't recall that. i don't recall that, but i think the  i think the question is not at all clear where  where a bank would be located if it's in a state where it has facilities, property, or employees but not a branch. and as you said in your concurring opinion in sisson against ruby, it's not a good idea to have a jurisdictional statute  reading of a jurisdictional statute that creates ambiguities.
the case is submitted.
assuming 
have you surveyed the circuits? i know this  what  what you describe as the practice certainly wouldn't have been in the first circuit. maybe in the d.c. it was, but i mean, we would have thought that we have the power over our own mandate. and of course, if it hasn't issued and some extraordinary thing comes along requiring a revision, we would have revised it. so when you read the rules and you say that's what we argue, you're not arguing it about any court that i'm familiar with as an appeals court. so  so have you looked up the appeals courts and found that in fact there is at least one court or two or maybe more that follow the interpretation that you're arguing for?
i thought he lived in l.a. (laughter.)
 question.
with respect to 
yeah.
but, your honor  the statute has been approved by congress. it is that which is authoritative. and this court has said, in other cases, like united states versus wells, and state farm versus tashire, that revisers notes are often erroneous. this court has said the cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the plain language must be followed.
thank you, mr. baker.
 in other words, a program that is a regulatory program regulating commerce, we should no longer think of that, though we tend to think of it as quite different in the way we approach the first amendment  we no longer, in your view, should?
no, but it may well  i guess the point that i'm trying to get at  and it goes back to your original public-interest issue  is, let's assume  as justice scalia's hypo had it, let's assume that the statement made by the employee on the subject within job duties  case like this one  is, in fact, a "stupid statement." let's assume it's wrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot. the issue is not whether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that turns out to be the case, be able to fire. the issue, it seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it should be totally unprotected, so that the employer could do anything, even if it's an accurate statement. and my understanding is that your argument on public interest was an argument that says, even if it's accurate and they were lying and so on, that there should be no protection. am i  and do i understand you correctly?
the case that comes closest, as far as i can see, is probably united states v. armstrong, and in that case, this court said in the ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe the offense was committed, the decision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests entirely in his discretion. but, of course, the discretion is subject to constitutional constraints, the equal protection component of the due process clause. the decision whether to prosecute may not be based on an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. and the standard the court articulated there was the defendant must present clear evidence 
and i  just from an economic standpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong to me.
i 
no, no, i didn't mean  finish.
and is it possible that that can be patentable, in your view?
no, you want to reserve your time. okay.
and he also had a continuing obligation to inform the government of his address. one fact about this case that  perhaps it was in the record and i missed it. at the time the property was sold, how much did mr. jones owe, taking account of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties, all that?
i don't. first of all, i don't think that's what it says, and i don't think it would confuse the jury, and i'm confident that with that official instruction, counsel could explain it. but let me stop here, because i know this was something that justice scalia expressed some uncertainty about in the state farm argument, and that the oregon supreme court said they didn't clearly understand. to consider the conduct means to evaluate it in connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the conduct being punished.
and now what they're doing here is they're saying we have a cause of action. it's called habeas corpus. and we're asking for a rule of decision in that cause of action, and the rule of decision in this cause of action, just like mine, was in property. is the decision  the rule of decision is the rule written into the treaty, just like in the property case, and you cannot do anything that contravenes it though, of course, you can argue about the content of that rule of decision.
but do you agree if he had said i propose alternative x, even though it's highly unlikely the state will accept it, that would make it a 1983 action?
your 
as i understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo. is that right?
ms. blatt.
yes, but that was triggered, in part, by nancy temple's recognition  in the midst of serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that enron was in the process of imploding, arthur andersen, which was basically on probation with the sec  because it had been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior summer, and was under a cease and desist order  and seeing the sec coming down the pike, at that moment, she decides to remind the enron team, which had not been at all compliant with this document-retention policy, "it's time to get the files in line." this wasn't because all of a sudden the company had become preoccupied with neatness; it was so that it could document, in its audit work papers, those things that supported its conclusions. that's what its document policy said.
it's quite different  i don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, after the trial is over, to raise the statute of limitations. but, up front, it's a different situation.
correct. that is, the  the jurisdiction of the district court action we believe was a federal 
the requirement is not found in 1 the fourth trigger. the requirement is found in the state 2 statutes of limitations. and to elaborate on the 3 footnotes in our brief, we have found that there are 4 approximately 
you, you could live with the sg 
i  i don't think it is. i 
that that alone has been enough.
nothing to do with importation, either.
i mean, that would be consistent with the  with the statute. wouldn't it?
but there was nobody on it in that trip.
okay.
no, i  i don't think the record in this case would satisfy it, because this  because 
there's no forgiveness 
where is that in the question presented?
yes. i'm going to get to the false and misleading statements outside the labeling in a minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they filed a complaint  a counterclaim which had as a count this was defectively designed. it is possible under texas law to prove that something is defectively designed. if they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we don't think that you can satisfy  that you are, in fact, complaining about a defective design 
we've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case. something like standing. we say standing is examined throughout the trial. there's an easier standard at the beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and finally, if the facts of  involving standing are tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the trial. i mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to be assured throughout.
would they do 
 because that is one of the contingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain. would you say, in those circumstances, that your answer would be the same, that there's no  there's no case or 
 i understand the morton salt case, but do the  i'm assuming they're in the same relevant market in which customers patronize both of them from time to time, but they can't identify that mr. smith was here on this day, and the other dealer on the same day, but just an overlapping in the  in the same competitive market. would that not create a prima facie case? and if not, how much more would they have to prove?
this court has made clear that the right to self-representation is unique.
you want a 1983 hearing in which a united states district judge tells the parole commission, now, here are your marching orders for future cases. you have to comply with this rule, that rule, this rule. what is an analog that you can give us where united states courts have done this under 1983? using an administrative case, if the  if the agency does it the wrong way, we reverse that decision. it would be like a review of a conviction that's not final. have we had cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now, these agencies are doing it the wrong way? you have to  can you give me an analog?
yes.
thank you.
that would be totally acceptable, because of the distinct interest in not only the finality in the interest of society, and repose 
but this is all  this has nothing  i mean, i  you have the total differently  different understanding than i do of this case, and i did read judge carter's opinion. i thought that case simply held that because your clients had interfered with an effort by j. howard to give quite a few millions of dollars to vickie marshall  because of that interference, they had committed the tort of inter vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay damages. now, they said a lot of things by way of what the evidence was. indeed, they did say, as you point out, that your clients forged three pages of the will. but that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and it did not invalidate anything in the probate proceeding, as i read it. now, what have i said that's not right?
no, your honor.
take it. take it. it's a good one. right.
well, this is  this is an effort by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be used in kansas, by and large  there's always going to be exceptions  fuel that is used, by and large, in kansas on the roads of kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that those roads can be built and maintained. now, how shall we, mechanically, impose and collect that tax? we will do it on the first receipt by the distributor.
yes, your honor. in footnote 5, this court addressed a contention, raised for the first time in argument, that boyde's evidence might be admissible under skipper versus south carolina, and this court distinguished boyde from skipper, for a couple of reasons. first, as the  as your honor pointed out, the evidence in this case related to good-character evidence, events that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in skipper, which dealt with post-crime events. the court also pointed out that the evidence in boyde  his dancing achievement, his good character evidence in that case  was not offered for the specific inference that the evidence in skipper was offered. the court, in footnote 5  and in the opinion, in general, in boyde  nonetheless found that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good-character evidence of the  of the defendant's present good character, because it showed that his crime was an aberration from otherwise good character. or, as justice marshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that boyde had redeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking consideration. and, as i was saying, the evidence in this case, and in boyde 
the ordinary, routine rule of reason you have waived. is that so?
mr. eastman, can i ask you this question? supposing this case came to us through the colorado state system instead of through the federal system, and the colorado supreme court had written precisely the same opinion that the tenth circuit ruled. would we have jurisdiction to overturn their holding that there was a property interest here?
well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. i assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect. it seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. if your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, i suppose all that congress can do is have mandatory minimums.
 and to do so by using price discrimination.
that's exactly right, justice kennedy, and it's also 
 me a policy argument. i don't want a policy argument, for the moment. i want to know  what you're saying is that the word "purchaser" means "purchaser in respect to the particular commodity  this one that is purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price."
either one.
i don't know the answer to that, your honor, other than, of course, as a court, this court obviously could enter judgment for petitioners. the fact that this court said 
he's known.
 that's not  that's not established. that's not established at all. his supervisor obviously thought he didn't 
see, what i don't understand 
mr. frey, i suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, i suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed.
well, let's say the defendant wanted to be represented by a relative whose  whose specialty is real estate, and for some reason, that lawyer is wrongfully disqualified. and so then the defendant ends up with a very experienced criminal practitioner with a national representation  a national reputation, and still the defendant is convicted. could that not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?
and does the statute say you have to do it that way? it has to be the group that's distributed?
well, if it's made publicly in the capacity as a citizen, assuming the public  it isn't a speech that he's making in the course of his duties  if he writes something to the press, he's speaking in his capacity as a citizen. that doesn't mean that it would be constitutionally protected; it simply means that you get to step two of the pickering balancing, because he's not carrying 
there are two things that are wrong with that, justice breyer. the first thing is that in contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in the absence of regulations, long distance providers would owe pay phone operators zero. there's no reason why long distance providers would give money to pay phone operators. the 24 cents here is to capture what callers owe the pay phone operators. and so the fcc has come up with an administrative system. but there's nothing unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example 
you may respond briefly.
yes, your honor, but it all depends on how it is done. here the way in which it is done is the most powerful and profound religious message that this court has ever considered on government property. here you have a monument that proclaims not only there is a god, but god has dictated rules for behavior for those who follow him or her.
that is true. that is true, and we would be prepared to do that if we were allowed to go back and  and proceed. we have produced evidence at the  at the pleadings stage, and as we sit here today, since there hasn't been an answered filed, our  our pleadings are  are accepted as  as true for  as a matter of procedure. the interesting thing is, is that  is that florida created this problem. they can  they can lay it out as to how to euthanize dogs and cats, but they can't do it for humans. that's perfectly in the open. yet, they shroud this in secrecy. we can't get public records. we can't  3.852(h)(3) of the florida code of criminal procedure prevents us from going and getting these records before 
well, now you're building in something that i didn't ask. i'm asking you if it is possible that the better strategy for a defendant in a given case would be to focus on the sentencing rather than the guilt phase based on an evaluation by the attorney of the evidence.
would you agree at least to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the district court said on summary judgment, there was sufficient evidence to go to a trial. that that's true. so we have to accept his allegations that there were selective citations for violations of grazing  grazing laws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the place up?
right. you 
well, yes. the ability to raise price 
well, but what if it's a foreign conviction where there's no due process? is there a checklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a jury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did you have the right to remain silent? i mean, we all seem to realize that the government's position that any conviction anywhere is too stark a place. and again 
the case is submitted.
your honor 
thank you, counsel. mr. stoepker.
that's what they say, your honor. secondly, if equilon were given the right to do its own pricing, if they had given all of that right to them, and that they weren't the real puppeteers, as it were, that would  might be a different situation.
if i did  i'm sorry, that question 
in the classroom delivering the prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the school wishes to present a particular message, that's one case. however, in the lunchroom, outside in recess, across the street, that is a quintessentially open forum where it would not be proper, i think, to tell students you may not mention this subject, you may not take this position.
(e)(3)(e).
the tax code, section 6338(b) specifically provides that title passes under state law, not under federal law. the only issue of federal law here 
you  you just haven't reached that point. right?
well, if we're talking about what  where is the logic in the result that i believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the state court on harmlessness grounds, because the state court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him. whereas if the state court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on  or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. now, you know, why would there  what does he care whether  whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? why should there be a different standard of review between the two?
well, your honor, i wish i could draw a brighter line rule 
i understand that. here, first of all, when congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title vi, when congress passed title ix, it was a background in the law from sullivan v. little hunting park that  that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. the title vi regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. it provided for retaliation. and moreover, this court as recently as the davis case, franklin and davis, and in the north haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title ix and have, therefore, agreed that cannon v. the city of  v. the university of chicago creates that cause of action. now, this case is actually a lot easier than davis, even taking into account the concerns that  that you and other justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. this is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. it's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. but it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible federal agency.
i don't  i don't follow that entirely, mr. phillips, because the  exxon lost at  at this trial, and preclusion doctrines  that means that exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend. so exxon is going to be bound by that  by the determination. somebody who was not in the litigation and might say, well, i want more, say, somebody who had opted out 
if you bought 
yes, your honor.
and it isn't raised by your opponent's petition.
justice scalia 
thank you, mr. long. mr. stearns, we'll hear from you.
well, but i give 
i don't want to misinterpret the attorney general, the solicitor general's remarks but he indicated in those case there could be an as applied challenge.
no, your honor. no, i don't believe so. that's 
thank you, mr. ott.
that's correct.
if that is the case, then i don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about your having a cause of action the day after you purchase before the market has found out and before the fraud is known. i mean, this  this strikes me as an exercise in  in an inconsistent theory.
we want  as the  as the fifth circuit found and the district court found, we filed a declaratory judgment in texas after we received their demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in a single forum, which the texas venue rules would not have allowed, and we  we actually filed this in lubbock, texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29 farmers operate. now, with respect to defective design, yes, under texas law if they had a  they have to allege and they have to prove that there is a safer alternative design for this product, which they never even introduced one quantum of evidence about. but 
well, your honor, i think there's a question of what you mean by the word predominance. and i as understand the court's cases, there are times when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to  to kind of gather up minority voters as, for example, in miller v. johnson where we had a very similar district, where race is said to predominate in a different sense than it does when you simply are creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or to  to stay in compliance with the voting rights act. clearly, the voting rights act requires you to create minority districts. it should require that it makes sense that people make efforts to do that. we're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things. we're just saying in this instance, under this court's cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a different way which sends this extra message of excessive racial consideration.
so, fine. so i want to know what he was charged with. let me do that one. now, what will you let me look to to see what he was charged with?
well, my  my  i suppose my most straightforward answer would be that the jewish forward can burn as quickly as the new york times, that the christian science monitor 
well, you can find that the court was wrong and not like what you did  what the court did, but the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the instructions as a result of the court's conduct. and that requires an analysis of the context of the proceedings, and that is precisely what the california supreme court did. they 
ms. smith, this  unlike the calderon, which is a  was a  a court has authority to recall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to be a really idiosyncratic case. i mean, this was an extraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, i wrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally okay, and now i discovered in the file things i never saw before. this is a death case. i have reason to suspect that this person may not have been competent when he committed the crime, may not have been competent when he  when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very moment. a judge in that situation  he finds something that looks like it's the  it's  it's the key piece of evidence in favor of the defendant. somehow it never got submitted. a judge, knowing that he has written an opinion saying this man, as far as the federal courts are concerned, goes to the state and they can set their date of execution and all that  that was an  this case is so idiosyncratic that i'm concerned about dealing with 41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.
with  with new dicta of our own? (laughter.)
you do not  you do not need a conviction. but, in order  the immigration consequences 
 other entities.
there's no guarantee.
does any of those cases squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an accessory after the fact on a general indictment like this?
yes, but there's nothing in the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?
the immunity argument could be raised in state court. that's what this court held in kircher. but the defendant would be forever denied its right to a bench trial under federal law. that right is limited to suits in the federal courts by its term; 1441(d) 
fine. then why is it in your opinion that the immunity thing is so important that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ thing is not so important since all, what turns on that is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.
let me  let me ask you. maybe this is irrelevant, but were  were these restrictive ira's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? if the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his  his ira?
that  that all may be true, of course. they're talking about don't contract out to the indians something that should be done in washington. but what has that got to do with the issue? we're talking, i thought, about  about government contracts. people who enter into government contracts need certainty. they have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. and a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. and under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. okay? that's the principle. and 
 this instruction  
justice breyer 
no, that's not  that's not what i've been asking.
what can't  what can't be sucked in under section 201? i mean, once the fcc issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust. and that's what's happened here. and this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation. it seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an fcc regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity.
you were  you were the petitioner.
well, they're not totally identical because you didn't have the first amendment interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a first amendment interest at stake here.
at the present time, that's the posture 
we would respectfully submit, as would any responsible state attorney general, that there are significant constitutional problems with a unilateral executive determination displacing generally applicable criminal laws. but whatever the resolution of that question, that would ultimately be reviewable by this court, on certiorari review.
yeah, i'm sorry, i keep saying congress; i meant the fcc. the fcc could not have said that, because it would have been forced  if, as the theory goes, the enhanced service has in it the separate product of communications and has a separate status, then they wouldn't have been able to take it out of computer ii. but let me suggest, stepping back for a second  and, by the way, i should add that in this case, in the paragraph 39 of the order under  below, the fcc said the two were not separable. okay? i understand that to mean they are ingredients intertwined, they are not separate products. but the basic thing that the agency did here was to decide which of two things is happening. are these two separate products? is this communications and chicken mcnuggets being bundled together? or are these two ingredients that are so interwoven, as they said in computer ii, as to form a distinct product?  is a classic example of what an agency does, and it's really not one that this court, i think, would be likely to secondguess. it is, indeed, in fact 
yes.
you mean if you executed 90 percent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do, it comes within that language, but if you don't execute at all, it doesn't? that seems to me most unlikely. i mean it seems to me 
well, city of boerne and other courts  other decisions of this court say that, to be a valid exercise of congress's section 5 authority, it has to be a response to a record of constitutional violations.
so we could decide that way. we could say, we don't have to decide what the standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as the government does, you would win, you would be happy 
it is, there's no question. but we're still at the preliminary injunction stage.
no, but could you?
which is to say, it's not a congressional program, it's a congressional spending statute that is the key predicate. and then once there's a congressional spending program, whether it's facial challenge or an as-apply challenge that relies on an intervening ministerial act of the executive branch, taxpayer standing will lie under this court's precedent.
yes, there was such a period. and this court noted that fact in 
yes.
that's 
well, your honor 
if that is generally known, it would seem to me that that itself would be sufficient incentive to try and avoid this program, whether or not you're going to be able to read the christian science monitor or the new york times. it seems to me that the  the  what we're fighting about is trivial compared to the very obvious deterrent value of 23 hours in the same cell 7 days a week, 30 days a month, 365 days a year. i don't think i'd care about this other stuff.
 fine. i'm saying the same thing.
within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for  is a presumptive endorsement. i think with the baptist brief. would you endorse that test?
you didn't really have a chance 
well, it has, but that depends on a totally circular argument. the minute it filed for bankruptcy, although there had been no default on the comp obligation, your client started incurring attorneys' fees, and it was not incurring attorneys' fees based on any default by the, by the debtor.
no. i'm trying to find a phrase in (e)(2). if the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, do you take that phrase as  as referring to a fraud-on-the-market theory or as being broader than a fraud-on-the  on-the-market theory.
those don't sound as if they thought his conversion to christianity made a difference.
i'm  i'm quite comfortable with the way the court analyzed it in michigan v. summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. that is, you  you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to 
okay.
 i would consider that still prospective, but just note my 
if pickering 
i drank pineapple 
you've got to assume 
was the legislation that established this tax benefit  was it controversial? were there those who opposed it as a giveaway to 
well, core  core government functions isn't  isn't the test either. i mean 
we could say that they had misconstrued colorado law? i don't think you really mean that.
this is an employee who said i never did one thing that was inconsistent with my federal employment.
i would have let the guy go.
all right.
but mr. wolfman tells us, ms. blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you suggest, the clause in the 1991 act, and points specifically to provisions that say, "no other provision of law enacted before, on, or after." the picture we're given of the 1991 act is that up until 1991, whatever exists up until 1991, there's no time limitation, but that this 1991 statute does not speak to subsequently enacted statutes.
well, then at  at a minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is  is in question by that. but also, it seems to me if i were a juror and was faced with these conflicting things, i would look for motive.
 what if the spouse had put a sign up, "no police allowed here"?
and the public disclosure was made in the newspapers rather than in an official government proceeding?
no, your honor, the solicitor general does not take that position either, in their brief they recognize that this applies to all level of mark.
i'm not sure i understood what you just said. you said until the plan is filed and approved the property remains in the possession of the chapter 13 trustee.
it could be improper in the sense that it was a misstatement of evidence. i don't know that impropriety would include necessarily emotional appeal. i mean, the constitution does not require a trial devoid of emotion. however, impropriety under donnelly and darden was the first tier of the multi-tier kind of fundamental fairness test. so even assuming that that first tier, that the statements were improper, they still did not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness. secondly, none of the individual comments implicated the defendant's rights under the fifth or sixth amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind of comments that this court has found to violate the eighth amendment under caldwell.
mr. brunstad.
your honor 
okay, don't you  don't you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?
and so you've got  i think you've got a stronger argument. the problem that i have in this case is that, number one, i view the wearing of the buttons, as i just described it, as something that is abnormal and something that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention. i don't know why otherwise they would be doing it. and from whatever source, we do know that the button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger. so it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and understood perfectly that these were people who were raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. i can understand that, and under the general rule out of williams and flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom evidence. what, however, do i make of the fact that not one single court has ever reached that conclusion and  you know, as a constitutional matter? am i in the position of sort of being jim, and they're all out of step with jim? i'm raising a question about my own judgment in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have come to that conclusion. what do you think i should make of that?
your honor, it's important to keep in mind that there are two messages going on here, and they are clashing. there is the military's message, which the schools are interpreting as, "uncle sam does not want you," and there is the school's message, which is, "we do not abet those who discriminate. that is immoral." and 
okay. now, do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?
that's exactly correct, justice 
was it just 
and what about the municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we were talking about earlier?
well, the states do not  exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest with the occ. but wachovia bank and wachovia mortgage are separate and distinct.
okay. and he did that here.
why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all? if  if you're right that this is not a deadly weapon case, this is strictly a firearm case, it's not a lesser included, here the prosecutor charged deadly weapon 
we're even  yeah, we're even more in the dark now than before. [laughter.]
the problem in craig, with the name plaintiff, is, it wasn't a class action, an 18-year-old sent to turn 21 in the fullness of time. but i didn't understand your answer about the beer seller whose standing saved the case, at least in the view of the majority of this court. she had a real pocketbook injury. she was not able to sell her beer to the thirsty boys. so  [laughter.]
is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?
the statute does not provide for judicial review 
thank you, mr. cole. mr. enrich.
well, there are class actions that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. and the question of whether or not they are "in connection with purchase or sale" is going to have a profound impact on whether or not those claims are also preempted. i can't spell out for you what the necessary consequences are, but there are a lot of state-law claims brought under blue sky laws and other state remedies that traditionally have been observed and brought, even as state claims, but, under a  you know, the all-encompassing parameter of "in connection with purchase or sale" advanced on the other side, a decision that would favor that could have unknown preemptive consequences, which i would submit would be contrary to the normal way you would put congress to the test of determining, "did it intend to preempt those claims?" before adopting a broad interpretation that would do so. and if i could point out 
i think it  it may well be, but i don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because i think they have to have their own right to bring the action, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't. because they don't have an implied right of action under lear, they don't have a right to bring this action. and that is an essential component of their ability to challenge the issue of validity. so, i think that's the first and fundamental 
mr. sullivan, you have 2 minutes.
well, it's not necessarily an object. i don't know whether you would call a stream of photons that is constantly repeated under the atlantic ocean an object.
 the part of the decision on which you rely is the footnote at the end of the opinion, is that right?
 that would be incorporated in rfra. and it  a  an order that puts the united states in violation of that  and the court of appeals didn't really deny  a majority of the judges, anyway  deny that this injunction requires the united states to violate the convention 
thank you, mr. phillips. this  these cases are submitted.
i mean, there are certain situations where the injection is contraindicated. i think they'd be relatively rare situations. and i think, you know, you could imagine i suppose that the statute might pose a problem if you could identify particular conditions where a d&x was particularly useful, and those were also situations where an injection would be contraindicated. i think, you know, the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a million; i don't know, but it's very small. another point that's made in the record which i think is important is they suggest well, you know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be successful something like 92 percent of the times. i think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement would certainly take care of any concern that the physician would have 
i just wanted to know what the facts are about the rule. i was just  that's what i was asking.
right.
oh, i don't think it's a big change at all, justice kennedy, and i  i think what i'm trying to make clear here is that there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness. certainly the court does not have to get into that in this case to decide it 
no, your honor, the ninth circuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction. and indeed if petitioner had litigated the question of jurisdiction they could have brought a writ to the ninth circuit and come to this court and litigated the question of jurisdiction. if the court had found there was jurisdiction it could have reached the merits. if the court had found it was not, there was no jurisdiction, it would have  in the three-judge courts and said no, you need to come directly up from the guam supreme court with vacate and remand for a fresh judgment, and then you come to the guam supreme court.
exactly. and so, they are saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking that the language and context don't embrace it. since they used the wrong standard, they never got to the question of whether the evidence warranted a directed verdict. so i don't see how we avoid looking at all of what you'd call the atmospherics.
there is a risk, justice kennedy, but i think that, first of all, that even in those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk between the d&x procedure and the d&e procedure are really as far as i can tell nonexistent. even in that condition, unless there's some reason not to put the injection in, if the doctor really thought the d&x procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as dr. carhart does in every single case after the 17th week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has nothing to worry about from this statute. and i think the very fact that they are attributing significant risks to a single injection shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance position. and that's a legitimate position, i suppose, but it's completely inconsistent with this court's precedence, most notably the casey decision. because if all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk, then this court should have struck down the 24-hour waiting period in the casey decision, because the plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has imposed significant risks. they were backed in that point by an amicus brief by acog. but this court didn't say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule. this court instead upheld the 24-hour period, even though it required overruling akron i's contrary decision and this court pointed, of course, to akron i as an exemplar of the pre-casey decisions that put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing interest that the government has in this area. and so with respect, i think that the argument they are making is effectively an argument for returning to akron i and thornburgh, where the rule of law was that there would be no interference between a doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best judgment as to how to treat the patient. this court of course consciously moved away from that in casey and expressly repudiated the language in akron i and thornburgh to that effect.
that is not a moral judgment, because it says nothing about the personal culpability 
no. what  what 
and i want to be clear, we are not  we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches that states can undertake of parolees, and i'm, by no means, arguing today that all of them, or even most of them, are unconstitutional. this is a 
that's not covered, because that's an act of ordinary negligence. damage to the package would always be covered, but the act of creating a hazardous condition would not be covered, because that's an ordinary tort that would be  subject private persons to a liability between themselves. and that's  the purpose of the federal tort claims act is to allow the government to be held responsible for ordinary torts if there would be a like liability between private persons.
no. assuming the four 
thank you, counsel. general clement.
 ask you this. the  the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the  the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.
that's 
that's  that's a decision following a reason, and the reason is a federal reason.
in your view  even though the federal standard would not be controlling, in your view, if you applied a general reasonable-person test, would the federal standards be admissible so that the plaintiff could argue that there was a failure here which is evidence of negligence?
well, i think there are  there are  i  there are several answers. and, if i might, first of all, if you must characterize what  and we are happy to do so  was in the 1996 act as either a time bar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former, because this  because the limitations periods in the law are ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense. for instance, the rules of civil procedure say limitations periods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case law is unanimous that they can be waived. that is not what this provision does. this provision restricts the authority, in the first instance, for the government to bring the case. the second thing i would say, though, your honor  and i think it does not matter, ultimately  that can be our principal submission here, and it is, but it does not matter  i think, ultimately, the nomenclature doesn't matter, because  again, because the act restricts the authority of the government to bring a case that is beyond the 10-year period. and that is the statute that contains the express reference. that is the 
 to adopt, would not be sensible for us to adopt. but i'd have a hard time saying that i could justify it as a statement of current california law, and i'm 
the defendant would have been happy to have his biological mother talk with the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological mother say the same thing in court?
is  is that just a rule of the patrolmen in the state?
i mean, and  and, you know, a buckshot attack on it has to be examined pellet by pellet.
no. but they  on the first point, did they refuse to  did they fail to consider a number of the challenges like the patton analogy, that's clear. he raised that in his brief. he said this was something i'm complaining about. they did not consider it. he raised the point about 
no, it is not the report. it is called an opinion. it isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. does anything else describe the report? and what is this report? there is a report. it is submitted to the chief judge. what would you call that?
no, your honor. the  the tax  the full tax court doesn't go back and  and hold a new trial, just like the individual tax court judges 
you, in all likelihood, win in that hypothetical. you 
no. the written instruction followed the arguments of counsels. and what  and so no, there was no instruction after that.
whereas, this suit here  it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. if it's wrong, it's wrong. i mean, it's quite a different 
wouldn't 
correct.
and there wouldn't be any need either because it's not a specific intent crime and there's no requirement 
 who would be available and who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims. are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?
i think if you did that, justice stevens, it would present the very difficult question that this court has never squarely addressed, which is, does the president have some authority to try, by military commission, beyond that which congress has joined him in? obviously, article 21 of the ucmj gives congress's sanction to any military commissions, to the extent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war. so, in that sense, i think, as long as this court construes consistent with over 100 years of united states tradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law  a violation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't have to reach that 
yes. and  and if you want a shorter statement  i mean, a brief is a brief  a short statement of what our test is, justice breyer, it's quite simple, and that is a rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set aside a denial of habeas relief on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is barred. that is the territory that aedpa occupies. that includes, justice souter, not just determinations on the 
so, you think it's a different case if it's not a continuous motion; in other words, that the water is released  you know, it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it has to build up in the  you would draw a distinction and say there's a discharge, in that case?
no, but only intent plus monopoly power. you have to be able to prove monopoly power, too.
actually that isn't really the issue. i think  i find that easy. the harder issue is  is whether the  a person who thought about it differently than me, a judge, would have  be objectively unreasonable. at least for me, that's the hard question. the question you're arguing is not hard.
if he had left voluntarily under the pre-'96 law, would he still have been subject to criminal prosecution for his prior illegal entry if he had later come back into the united states?
 that opinion, by the way? both sides cited it. the  is it  it was unpublished.
well, does it or doesn't it? the  the facts are simply that the manager takes out all the employees, except this one that filed the title vii charge, once a week. is that 
so what's wrong with just saying that flast stands for the proposition that when the government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer  after all, the money comes from the taxpayer  can bring a lawsuit? and the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge. and sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing. so we have a pretty clear, simple rule. that rule applies whether it's congress or the president acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which i think is close to what the other side 
no, i  we don't suggest  we don't suggest that.
your honor 
well, it isn't a matter of whether it's before it. i  i just wonder whether it goes to  to the issue here, whether you needed to get his assent or not. it  it probably goes to the quite separate question of whether there was inadequate performance by counsel. no? is that question before us also?
 is the check mark. no. the check mark on the form that says, for example, plea, admit sufficient facts. you know, that's a check mark or it's on the form. it says plea, guilty. i mean, you know, you could have different things checked. so that's what established the guilt. and then the police report establishes whether  what kind of a thing was at issue. and i will agree with you that if it's at all contested, we shouldn't get into it. but if it's not contested, there's no question. there was no boat around there. it's a city street. or there was no car. it's plain it was a building. then that's just as good as the jury instruction. why not? tell me why not.
in many cases, the state law of malicious prosecution will provide a remedy. of course, in illinois and in all states, it requires favorable termination. in this case, of course, petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show favorable termination because the circumstances under which the criminal case ended did not  were not consistent with a favorable termination. but, of course, he would have had a fourth amendment claim if he had filed it timely. he would have had a state law malicious prosecution claim if he had been able to show favorable termination. in states that don't have malicious prosecution, perhaps there would be a due process claim as well. the result that there are no damages available to somebody when the conviction is overturned solely by operation of the exclusionary rule, however, should not be troubling because the conviction itself, of course, was not an independent violation of the constitution. petitioner did receive the benefit of the exclusionary rule. his conviction was overturned. we're not aware of any case indicating that deterrence purposes would require both the exclusion of evidence and a damages claim.
but you can't give me any text in this statute itself. it isn't the phrase "air pollution" or any other phrase?
was taylor an immigration case?
may i ask you? it's perhaps an unfair question. the chief justice generally likes to confine our attention to cases of this court rather than the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most of the rooker-feldman law is court of appeals law, as we  we both know. going back just to rooker and to feldman, those two cases, and putting aside asarco for a minute, which of those two cases do you think provides you the stronger support, if indeed any support, between rooker and feldman?
that's conceded, as i understand it from maryland 
it 
 rather the confrontation.
i don't think it would be required. i think it would be reasonable to say that habeas relief must lie. there are many  there are much fewer inferences that could be drawn there.
and there was no requirement that they stay together, no requirement that they do anything in particular. they 
you  i don't see how that's open to argument. you can say, "consider the evidence that shows he's a good person underneath it all," or, "there  he has some moral values that ought to be respected," or something like that, or, "he's capable of doing good things." but i don't see how you can argue doubt.
yes. in the 
well, your opponents have said that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here. they're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids, because you're selling to the kids at home; there's no serious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory interests  they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy the way they're stated. i mean, they're saying that, by a process of elimination, what you get down to is nothing but discrimination and protectionism. what is  what is your answer to that? where is 
well, mr. chief justice, it's worth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market value argument here, this $80,000 number. that was a number that arises in connection with the supersedeas bond, and it's only a number that came forward by the private loan  property purchaser, not the state. and the reason was, was because they said, if you don't put up an $80,000 bond, we want to take over the property immediately. and so they had every incentive to say a number that was significantly higher than what the value of this property is. the best evidence of what the value of this property is is around the $20,000 that a real purchaser put on the table in order to purchase it. the point here 
what function do they perform? what case would it cover that would not otherwise be covered?
can i  can i ask what you make of subsection (d) of  of this provision which says that violations of this section may be investigated by such components of the department of justice as the attorney general may direct and by such components of the department of the treasury as the secretary of the treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to offenses over which the postal service has jurisdiction, by the postal service? apparently there was some turf war going on as to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and  and this was meant to  to solve the turf war, but it reads violations of this section. now, does that allocation of authority among justice and treasury and the postal service not apply to the conspiracy offenses under section 371? because that's not a violation of this section.
well, that's a 
justice breyer, there is a long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes, goes from high level system architecture to all the way down through component architecture, pseudo code, source code, which is, which is a description that humans understand, and the actual machine language that a computer will understand. invention  patents do not specify machine language. the machine code is totally dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and somebody who takes source code  i could make an argument that if you take, steal the microsoft source code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas, but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into something a computer will understand that will combine with a computer, that involves a question of whether what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to assembly. look at it from the perspective  maybe this helps. let's look at the question from the perspective of microsoft, the oem, and the user overseas. object code is the end of microsoft's manufacturing process. that is what they make. they don't make hard drives, they don't make disks, they don't make computers. they fully finish their product, the windows operating code, and then send it overseas. the oem is 
no, but here under 1326 it's official quite different. the intent of the legislature was that the attempt would itself be a substantive offense.
no, justice scalia, that's not correct. that was what they did with nelson, his predecessor.
yes, that is our view, and let me supplement your comments in this regard. section 
was that second circuit's decision a decision that said the court didn't have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue? was that the basis for the second circuit's decision?
that's what the 
no. the anticompetitive  the plan is to drive the company out of business. and the only anticompetitive conduct other than proving the whole objective is that you pick on this one competitor and outbid him every time you can. could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?
because you can use the same word, you can apply the same word in different places differently, depending on what your basic object is in the different place. it's very hard to say what kind of modification might exist over here, there, the other place. and you put your finger on a very difficult question for power companies, because those turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so forth during a day, during a month, during a year, so it's hard for them. therefore, you have a complex official definition. what's wrong with that?
no, but the question was before the court, because the dissent certainly raised the question.
it goes to the 
 started happening?
well, what do you say about your brother's argument that the statistics show there's a 3 percent chance, i think it was a 3 percent chance of violence in the course of committing the burglary? i take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want to take justice breyer's approach, about the potential  the actual proven potential for violence at the near attempt stage.
that's all she's saying, as i understand it. she  she can  as i understand her cause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the will is valid, the  the trust is valid. just give me the money that i would have had.
they don't have to give them any money, though. the court doesn't have to.
why isn't this discussion just suggest what the answer is to the legal question raised? the answer is, of course, you cannot get a hold of this money in the hands of the victim. the money in the hands of the accident victim is not your money. it is not medical expense money. it was stipulated that it is not. that doesn't leave you without a remedy. the remedy is to go against the causer of the accident and get the extra money that you think is entitled to you. the statutes say that literally, and why not just follow them?
that is not correct. in this case, the petitioners 
yes.
i don't think so, justice kennedy, because the government's position here has never been that the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute. what the government focused on in this case was using a document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to clean up and purge files when a government investigation was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials would be relevant.
do we have to find that the strike of at least one african american prospective juror was race-based for you to prevail?
no, to the contrary. not only  there's no pullman issue presented in this case, but the procedural posture of this case demonstrates, if anything, a full-throated appeal to the state courts. they 
you know, that's 
why?
 but could the state allow it?
but, your honor 
if we look at the things that parents are concerned about when they're considering where their children are going to high school, we look at things like sat scores, for example, or performance on statewide tests, would we see that, the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed schools have similar test scores?
but they point out  they realized, i think, petitioners, that this is a problem that  that this is a unique act, and they  and they point out  they make the claim that the major fraud act somehow renders this not unique. that's a criminal statute and it doesn't have a qui tam action. every retaliation claim is going to be based in part on an alleged violation of section 3729.
but certainly on burden cases we don't require that.
 were sued, yes  if chatham county were sued for something done by a law enforcement officer, would your theory apply?
it derives from footnote 12 of merrell dow where the court was attempting to explain this  this difference that we are discussing. and in footnote 12 of merrell dow, the court says that the nature of the jurisdictional answer will frequently depend upon the different nature of the federal interest that is at stake. and it distinguished between smith and  and moore in that case, smith being a federal constitutional question, moore being a federal statutory question.
right. i think the presumption 
but someone  someone who would be picked up would be an applicant for admission and could be released under this  under this statute. but  but focusing here on the people excluded at the border 
i'm sorry.
it does, and it does, and to the extent that's what you are characterizing as an export ban, that's certainly correct. what the court has found problematic about export bans are either that they are put in place to create local to correct economic opportunities, for example the timber cases or the shrimp cases. that's not what you have here. there's no allegation that the purposes of these statutes is to foster or promote local industry. in fact, the only plaintiffs in this case are local haulers themselves.
no. the effect of such discrimination has to be to harm competition with the favored purchaser. and if all transactions are hermetically sealed from one another, yes, the buyer might like a better price, but it's not complaining about the effect of such discrimination on competition with the favored purchaser. to put this point in perspective, imagine that volvo raised its price to every so-called favored purchaser 
yes. (laughter.)
all right. now, if you think that's valid, i understand that you think this complaint does just what i said in the field of antitrust. but is there any case that you've come across which would say a complaint just as i have described it 
this court made clear in bush v. vera that the state may not make exactly the kind of assumption, justice scalia, that you described. the  the court held in bush v. vera that you cannot use race as a proxy for partisanship. you cannot make that assumption. so if the state 
let me draw a distinction between those cases where the cause of action is supplied by federal law, in which case factual issues are resolved by federal courts as long as there's a federal cause of action and cases where there's not a federal cause of action. then you need  the right to relief has to depend on a substantial question of federal law. so if the only issue in the case, in that kind of case, is a factual dispute and everybody agrees on the law, then there's no substantial federal question, no removal jurisdiction. but if the right to relief depends on federal law and the meaning of federal law and there's also a factual issue in the case, that would be removable.
thank you for throwing me the life preserver. i  (laughter.)
but  but this argument is not trying to decide for the states. this argument basically is if nobody can figure it out, including a federal district judge, at least give me the benefit of the doubt with equitable tolling.
because what he's saying is, i'm asking for an instruction on an offense which is lesser  it does not  it's an offense that doesn't include the course of the crime, but it does include the other elements. it includes killing with intent. isn't that lesser-included on your definition of mississippi homicide law?
your honor, if it is a 760 expense they should get the money back. if it is a non-760 expense which is not germane, then they would have to opt out at that  they would have to opt out to get that kind of money back, unless your honor is referring to what happens on, if the statute is upheld, what happens when we go back and have a further trial on the issues in this case. i'm not sure which scenario you were envisioning, but 
i don't know what he means by very close. the  the solicitor general would agree with me that  that there's nothing in the record to indicate what those distances are. and it's irrelevant in  in our opinion whether it's  whether it's a mile or 20 miles or 50 miles or 100 miles, and that's the point. there does  under the  under the federal regulations a true, significant nexus is not required, just any hydrological connection. this is a presumption on congressional authority. this expansive interpretation destroys any distinction between what is national and what is local under  as  as has already been pointed out. under the federal regulations, you can't dig a ditch in this country without federal approval. you can't fill it in. you can't clean it out without federal approval. this reads the term navigable right out of the statute. we  we ask this court not to allow these agencies 
if he did it for the purposes of trying to determine whether you had a vitamin deficiency. now, if he did it for the purpose of trying to determine, as in the prior art, whether you had an inherited enzyme condition, that would not be infringing. and this point was addressed, obviously somewhat indirectly because it was never raised in the court of appeals, by the federal circuit at page 9a and 10a where the federal circuit explained the correlating step was included as a limit for the intended use of the test as a means to distinguish the intended use for this test from the prior art.
all right. now, suppose in maine what i do with my trucks is i say i want michigan to be my home state for purposes of  what do you call it? the ss?
more statements in congress, more statements that you  doctors who say, i need this procedure for safety.
well, it wouldn't 
no. he has no money. all he has is the ring in his pocket.
that's right, and that's why we are not disagreeing in this case that there's been an infringement of his constitutionally protected interest in having counsel of choice. but the question for this court is how should that be defined as a denial of a sixth amendment right. should it be something that is automatically reversible so that even if respondent had 
if these  if these computers are built abroad and are sold with windows installed, the component is the electrons on the hard drive? is that what, that's your position?
 i'm just saying that that is certainly one interpretation of "reasonably directly." and if that is so, then you are erroneous in your assumption that the question before this court is the meaning of the statute. it might not be. it might be  it might be the meaning of the instruction.
correct.
what do you say in  you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that 99.99 percent of the population, other than your client and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the dna evidence that was found. do you  is  is the court wrong in saying that?
mr. bland, some state may say fraud in the inducement is void. these  these are classifications that states make. these are labels that the state puts on them. and you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable. you are forced into that because the prima paint case dealt with voidable. so you  that you  you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from state to state.
well, that would be an issue of fact.
when you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the establishment clause, did you mean just this texas case or other cases involving an eagles ten commandments?
no, it's not automatic. typically in the commonwealth countries, a judge has a lot of equitable authority to kind of balance some interests and decide whether or not to exclude the  the evidence. and i'm not saying that it's happened worldwide, that it's pervasive practice, but in  in some sense, what other countries are doing in their individual systems, it's nice to know but it's not all that controlling because the question, again, is how does this statute work as domestic law?
even  even when the map is so distorted  you  you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this  this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the republican party and the number of republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the democrats.
i don't 
no, i'm not claiming that congress necessarily has to make the record, but i believe the record has to have been created before congress acts; otherwise, the 
but you referred to something that was waived.
oh. what i  what i was suggesting is that there were 1,174 cases that were procedural-bar cases, where it said 
i mean, is that what the troll is?
it still constitutes a violation because they are executing a present disparity that is because of sex within the meaning of the statute.
well, certainly in situations where the court simply enters judgment and doesn't deny the motion first, that would be true 
it clearly was enacted later, but my point here is that i think the language  when the congress both in (a) and (b) harkens back to in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, it's clearly not trying to amend 1331 or 1332.
but then it wouldn't be a federal tort claims act.
the context here was a legitimate traffic stop.
it's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.
so, you would say 
i want  i want an answer to my question. what are you going to litigate for? what's left?
it is clear, justice stevens. that is  that is precisely what the international tribunals reject. conspiracy is a standalone offense. one can charge, as a war crime, attacking civilians and the like, as a pure crime, but what you can't do is charge conspiracy. and, indeed, the congress of the united states, in 1997, when they wrote the war crimes act, essentially made that conclusion, because they defined "war crimes" with incorporating a variety of treaties 
and when  and when you have someone who shoots the first person and is obviously attempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent discussion  not  not 100 percent clear that those were the two voices. it's pretty clear because there were only two other people there. so we talk about reasonable likelihoods, don't we?
 the only summary judgment that was granted was with respect to current acts of inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way the company was acting last year. and my question is  if that is correct, then i don't see how summary judgment could even intelligibly have been considered.
it is conclusive for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.
yes. when they wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration of the time for seeking review. they did not say that in (d)(2).
was  was he there  and i'll check the record  when the attorney told the jury that  that his client was  was guilty, that he basically was conceding guilt?
 yes, said we do not intend to overrule zahn, your honor.
 you've got a jury finding here. you've got a jury finding this was discriminatory.
right.
they're clear in this respect, they did not include an hourly rate test. as judge posner in the cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations because they don't say it, they don't provide for it, and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn on actual annual emissions. and the entire rationale epa offered was linked to that effort to capture real world changes in emissions.
should we put any weight on the title, on the name? i mean, i  i can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. was congress trying to fool people? (laughter.)
that's correct.
okay. but 
and you'd say it's the same.
yes, and 
it is because that's the way the court has treated the rule. the court has always 
all right.
that's correct.
second, justice scalia, if indeed it was a finding of fact, yes, that finding of fact was clearly erroneous.
sir?
an unacceptable risk, your honor.
that would be the required assignments of his job.
thank you.
 of her job.
well, would there be a substantial disruption?
that is correct, justice roberts.
could they have a discretion never to make the judgment?
here, what we know and what the jury found  and this is actually  it's important to keep in mind. this is a jury finding. the jury was instructed properly on what would constitute a material adverse employment action. the instruction is at page 63 and 64 of the joint appendix. one of the conditions that a jury could find an adverse action based on was a materially significant change in responsibilities. the jury heard evidence on the different types of responsibilities that the respondent performed, and it concluded that being changed, being reassigned after 3 months of working the forklift, to manually repairing railroad track was a materially significant change in responsibilities. that's the language that comes from this 
no, your honor, and that's why i think this case is before this court at this time.
how did hurtz's name enter into the trial?
well, do you  do you  i  i take it this is the implication of your position. do you take this position that in any instance in which a state supreme court decides a case on a federal  decides an issue on a federal ground in case a, and for whatever reason, case a is not brought to this court for review, that in every subsequent case in the state system, which depends upon state a, the state is totally without the  or this court is  is totally without jurisdiction to review it?
i think i might have misunderstood your question, justice souter. the question i understood was why don't they represent people and raise only the entitlement to right to counsel. in the bulger case, for example, the michigan supreme court 
and what would you then do? go on to penn central?
 the police, didn't she? she called the police to come.
well, they  what they were doing was certainly a prophylactic measure here, to  they recognized that perhaps there might be some concern of confusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of that happening. but notably, this case and  this case, and no other california supreme court case, has found that the factor (k) instruction, the pre-easley version of it, by itself, did mislead the jurors. in fact, the supreme court, in this case, came down 7-0 in support of the conclusion that the jurors were properly told about the 
it's justice kennedy's concern.
that's  that's right.
 than the person.
 that wouldn't wash out, on the other grounds?
if i can, i just want to make sure i answer your question.
 you don't dispute the fact that presumption of innocence  the presumption of innocence survives an indictment, doesn't it?
i believe that is the kind of speech 
so that your  your  you would then say they want a  they want to test certain  in certain cases where they think there may have been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but if there is  there is no reason to suspect that the statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they were not concerned to test its validity.
it's possible that there would be for some banks, but the main office is the place that  that the comptroller that  that is in their articles of association, which can be amended to change the main office, and it's approved by the comptroller of the currency. and  and they can move their main office. whether it  all  i know that in the case of wachovia, there is no divergence. north carolina is its main office and is its principal place of business. but i can't speak for everything.
 of our  of the gray brief.
yes. but the statutory language is the effect of "such discrimination" must be to harm competition in one of these justified instances.
not, not in the sense 
you're saying this patent, you really mean just claim 13, don't you?
but it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up. it doesn't answer the question. consider for what? how? why am i supposed to be considering it when you've just told me not to punish?
your honor, with respect, that is  that is directly at odds with the way the court, in segura, approached 
 asking you if, theoretically, some attention had been paid to the different kinds of producers 
there would be some in dispute.
now, what  that's a  my concern. what do you 
no, i don't think so. and, as we chronicle at length in our brief, both through history and contemporaneously, the use of the word "transmit" and "transmission" in postal services is commonplace, and it means delivery to  it means getting something to the person. congress has consistently used "transmission" that way. and the other thing i would like to bring you back to is, understand that the reason the vehicle distinction worked  one of the reasons congress would have expected that is, that had happened before in history. we show, again in our brief, a number of cases. for a long time, there have been distinctions between allowing liability for  and back then, it was stagecoach drivers that drove too fast through town. and those cases were held  you know, when you  when you held someone liable for driving too fast through town, that was held not to be a stoppage of the mail, stoppage of the transmission of the mail. but when you tried to regulate, more fundamentally, how the postal service decided to do its deliveries, and whom it would authorize to undertake the delivery, that was held to interfere with the mails. and i think 
right.
justice breyer, i don't think there's any reason to assume that everyone becomes a criminal. what this 
the case is submitted.
 if we call it "limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the 1991 act.
well 
well, the government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. it doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.
justice o'connor 
no, but i'm  i'm asking sort of an economic question rather than a legal question.
yes, your honor, i believe it is, and i believe that's what this court said 
which meant what?
correct.
 we have today.
i'm  i don't quite follow the question. would you mind restating it? official
i think "alibi" means, "i was somewhere else at the time of the offense." but if what the jury 
on the merits i don't think so, because if he was not in fact there as part of a school group 
 you'd still have to pay 
there would be an absolute prohibition, and this court in  in beaumont reserved that question of whether or not an absolute prohibition  and  and then in mcconnell, you struck down the absolute prohibition on minors' contributing to campaigns. so, yes, there would be a absolute prohibition on any way for any individual to associate with a campaign through a contribution.
 this inquiry 
right but that's  that being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim. the question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and that was the allegation. and the answer to that is he  i  he had every reason to believe that, based on what they've claimed because they've not produced a report or said that there's anything inside the report that says to the contrary about that. again, it seems to me 
well, the procedure for what happens upon the district court's review is not spelled out in the westfall act, neither is the review itself in particular. but the, the employee 
that would be a simple route to knocking out the case. the ninth circuit rejected that argument. that question did not seem cert-worthy and 
are those 20 days or 30 days counted in the tolling period? i thought part one clearly said the answer is yes. then we looked at california, and they don't have the words "20 days" or "30 days." they say "reasonable time." and then we said, "still applies, because 'reasonable time' is probably 20 or 30 days." they don't have a radically different rule; it's a similar rule. then we come to part three, and it says, "this is 45 days." there's  no 4 and a half months, wasn't it?
i think that means that the california supreme court would like to believe that its law is congruent with this court's decisions. i think that, in fact, the california supreme court does not follow this court's precedents in this area of law, and i think we actually argued the first time that we were in front of the ninth circuit, that it was futile to go to state court precisely for that reason. that argument was also rejected by the ninth circuit. i think that it cannot be that the state courts are going to be the  our final arbiter of whether their law is in fact congruent with federal law or not. it left either to this court 
so that you're saying, in substance, that you don't need to read the hobbs act the way they do in order to protect the public from the kind of harms that the  they would read the statute as covering.
well, there is a rule, i believe it's 
under lawrence the eighth circuit would have been wrong?
yes, there is, justice ginsburg. and the procedure  the most appropriate procedure is the duplicate warrant whereby the magistrate, satisfying all the concerns your honor has expressed, has this warrant. as to the final matter, the final determination of probable cause, he receives a call from the officer. there's an agent with the magistrate at the time. he advises what's just occurred. he can advise he took the package but did not go in the house. he took the package and did go in the house. the magistrate has the 64-page affidavit, is all prepared now. he can advise the officer to sign off on it, that it's okay to search now. he signed that 
so, why should we attribute to both the house and to the president a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?
on which particular 
and they did not have a separate committee proceeding on each separate part of that monster bill 
two  two points with respect to that. first, no, i don't know of empirical data in the seventh circuit. second, we know that retaliation charges are  are rising. they've more than doubled in the past decade. and third, the seventh circuit test is essentially like the  the test that this court applies in the first amendment context to determine when there's retaliation. this court in the rutan case observed that something as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party for an employee could satisfy that test. applying this test in the lower courts, courts have held that an officer not being able to see his police dog would be  could go to a jury, that  that a shunning conduct less than hostile work environment could go to a jury, that failing to hold employee feedback meetings could go to a jury 
now, he was given concurrent sentences.
then i think that is susceptible to harmless error analysis, your honor. and it would be  there would be an open question as to whether or not, of course, it is harmless, but then i think that we're back to the neder situation.
and it doesn't seem to me that there's any defect in this indictment. it charges  it recites the language of the statute, it uses the word "attempt" which has a very well-settled meaning in the law. any lawyer would understand exactly what is required for an attempt. it sets out the factual basis of the charge. so i don't know how you would get to the  how you can answer the second question without getting into the first question. official
i don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in state court anyway. they  they can always bring litigation.
yes.
rather, it is a partner, and mr. franzen is a partner in it. is that your argument?
clearly that  it's a very difficult line to draw. i  i can't make that call at this moment, but 
i mean, just  just don't  maybe you think that that's what it ought to be, but  but please don't tell us that that is how it originated. it plainly did not originate that way.
okay.
page 8, exactly. and that is, there are six different pieces to claim 4 and i'm going to take you to the relevant one. and they are the last two paragraphs here. we claim an electronic control attached to the support, so we specify where the electronic control is going to be. and then we say where, what that electronic control is going to be responsive to, and that's the next paragraph: said apparatus characterized by said electronic control being responsive to said pivot, and that said pivot is defined above to be a fixed pivot. so here is the design. let me take you to a picture if i could, and that's going to be at the back of the red brief. engelgau is the third foldout page. it looks like this. what we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot. it's the red pivot in our picture, and there's going to be an electronic throttle control. that's actually on the  you can't see it because you're looking straight at the device. that's on the next page. it's in green. there's going to be an electronic throttle control and it's going to respond to that pivot. so we specify where we're going to put the electronic throttle, on the support. that's what the federal circuit recognized was our invention. now 
do you agree on the answer  with the answer to the last question i asked? can  on a 50(a) motion, can a judge grant a new trial instead of granting judgment?
that is part of the question. that is true.
well, i'm not sure. it seems to me, as justice scalia's question indicates  i was surprised that we're talking about procedural default. i, too, thought this was an administrative law case. and it's an administrative law case, because we want the input of the administrative  of the administrative body. in the habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a matter of comity and courtesy to the state courts. is it 
well, that  that's 
well, what if they did? suppose they did say, "not me," and you proceeded with your lawsuit.
your honor, respectfully 
i want to be sure i  that i understood your answer. you can compel them to make warnings. can you compel them to pay for warnings that are just industry-specific, in saying, "this is dangerous" 
it is and it isn't, your honor, because that statement will alleges be true. there will always be scientific uncertainty. agencies will always have an understandable interest in seeing more information. they never 
was it brought to the attention of the court?
if you can tell 
it did. the magistrate judge initially recommended dismissing both the title vii and equal pay claims on the grounds that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity. the district courts held that there were fact disputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some reason only reinstated the title vii claim.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
yes. i am saying that 
in viereck the words were: "this is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war." and the prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the duties of soldiers and he said: do your duty. do you think that's a lot different than this case?
if, for example. i want to know how  how absolute you're making this. if, for example. and the next question i'd ask would be if you agree for example, what are the things you can look to and what are the things you can't?
but isn't it logically inconsistent for congress 
because i think that would help you.
gillett.
it's an argument that is basically a variation on the insanity defense. it's partial responsibility. it was basically the governing law in california until it was 
is this argument an assertion that the texas state court was wrong in its determination of this question of texas state law?
your honor, we agree and that certainly falls well within the  the range of culpability that this court set out in tyson as 
i'm sorry?
not  not that  not that it has to 24 use talismanic 
it's followed by another provision here.
 no matter what the government does, it cannot convert the career-services enterprise into a value-neutral proposition. for the law school, from its perspective, it's especially value-driven. yes, the 
you think if you 
 and presumably when the jury files in.
it is right? because i thought 23 that justice souter provided that, but you don't because 24 if you're relegated to (4)  let's say it becomes final 25 quickly. if you're relegated to (4), what you're saying 1 is the date on which the facts supporting the claim could 2 have been discovered, if this is a conviction that took 3 place 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which 4 those facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier 5 or whenever he could have brought it  brought the claim 6 in the  in the state court.
no. but i want to know what mr.  i mean, it does not relieve it of some constitutional obligation, and we're trying to figure out what that is. and  and the point of my question is in figuring out what it is, what significance do we give to the affirmative obligation on the part of the property owner to keep the government informed of the address?
well, i think it is.
but that does go  somehow that goes beyond mere relevance. you can't say that the  i don't think you can say that the existence of the million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant. it's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be combined with certain other kinds of evidence. and when you say you've got a standard that looks into that, then you have crossed the line from mere relevance to probative force, haven't you?
 and there was no dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it wasn't a discharge.
yes, there have been a handful of cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion, despite people v. stevens, and then they  they have lost because of stevens.
right.
yes. it's an example how provisos do not need to be 
general 
 burden persuasion there  that evidence already is required to be exchanged and disclosed. here 
 that will always be the case.
correct. far more.
 you a statutory reference, and then you tell me about something else.
well, your honor, referring to page 187 and 188 of the joint appendix, he says, given those circumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove he was the shooter of mary jane stout, legally, technically, i don't believe it makes any difference when you have two people acting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of committing an aggravated robbery and  and murder results.
well, i'm not sure that i can accurately tell you petitioners' position, but i can tell you our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market case the plaintiff cannot  has failed to plead loss causation unless the plaintiff pleads that the  the inflation attributable to the misrepresentation or omission has been removed or reduced from the price of the stock through dissemination of corrective information of some sort to the market. that does not mean that the company must make an announcement or that there must be an admission of fraud or that there must be really any information, any  any sort of formal disclosure. but if the information is disseminated to the market such that the market, in whole or in part, becomes aware of the truth and adjusts the price accordingly, that price adjustment is loss and the plaintiff has alleged loss causation in an amount to be proven at trial.
i was curious, though, which way that fact cut. i can see the argument that the closer the relationship, the more reasonable it is to say that the one party more or less recognizes that their privacy interests are held hostage to the views of the other. it's when you get the disrupted relationship, or their adverse interests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or the reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the other, becomes a little more strained.
and if you  if you did that, could you require, as i suggested of counsel on the other side, that you  that, as a condition of the licensing, that the business records of these companies be placed in some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you could get into and do an audit across the continent just as readily as you could do an audit next door? could michigan not do that?
mr. ott, you have one minute remaining.
precisely.
i'm surprised you say piecemeal. i would have thought most agencies in the government have like an inspector general or someone that you can complain.
 can i identify a concern? i'd like you to help me out on it. i  that language, if you construe it the way the other side does, it would cover certain violent conspiracies that would merely obstruct interstate commerce that we could all be concerned about today. are there other criminal statutes on the book that fill that gap?
you don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. you have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.
that doesn't necessarily make sense. you can imagine a situation where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but indict anyway without it. in other words, what's your response to the situation where there's no probable cause on an element at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?
all right. and, under that, you think that merck was entitled to a directed verdict 
 what it if were  what it were a school on a federal base? are they covered by this act, by the way? you know 
your honor, the  the sentencing phase argument is not contained in  in the joint appendix. the closing argument from the guilt phase is contained in  in the joint appendix, but it's certainly in the  in the transcripts before the court. what  what the prosecutor focused on at sentencing was  was the kidnapping and also was the malice and  and i'm sorry  the  specifically the kidnapping 
how can you assess the strength of the inference that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint without considering all the inferences that could be drawn from those facts? i just don't understand that argument. you see somebody  let's say you saw somebody today walking east on pennsylvania avenue in the direction of capitol hill. now you  there's  you could draw an inference that the person is coming to the supreme court. and if there were no other building in washington, that would be a very strong inference. but don't you also have to consider the inference that the person is going to the capitol, the person is going to the library of congress, the person is going to some other location up here? you have to consider all the inferences that you can draw from the facts.
was it just a ministerial act or did the executive have discretion involved, about who would receive the grant?
right. fine. okay. they make a finding that although we don't disagree with official that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health or safety of the mother. that's where we are. now as i look at the record, i see many, many, many doctors telling congress and everybody else that it is necessary, and safe. and i see other doctors telling congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't necessary, ever for safety. and so if medical opinion is divided, and i'm not advocating what i'm about to say, i just want to know your reaction. if medical opinion is divided, why wouldn't it be up to this court or could this court say this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to permit its use but only where appropriate medical opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of the mother? now, if congress is right, there will be no such case so it's no problem. but if congress is wrong, then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure and congress couldn't object to that because the congress isn't worried about, i mean congress, then congress was wrong. they agreed that we had a health or safety exception.
can we still go find the police report and then where do we stop?
correct, your honor, but the language utilized nevertheless 
it is a much greater right because it protects autonomy interests that are 
as opposed to how many who do?
mr. chief justice, that's not correct. even under a capability standard, even under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are going to compare something to prior art. you're going to take what exists now and compare it to what existed before, no matter what standard you're employing. and what they did is they compared it to the prior art, which is asano, and the federal circuit said, all right, you want to say it will come from asano. it would not come from asano for either of two reasons. the first is you would never use asano. that's the expert testimony. the second is the reason given by the pto in its brief in this case and that is you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render engelgau obvious. you would put it somewhere else. they say that you would put it attached to a lever up high. what i want to make clear is two things. the first is, though the federal circuit has in recent opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its test is, it has consistently cited earlier federal circuit precedent and said that the other side and the people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and misguided are mischaracterizing it. and the second is, the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion, motivation standard. so i don't want you to have the mistaken impression that there has been some radical change in federal circuit law. but no matter what one thinks about the differential between federal circuit law today and federal circuit law a year ago or two years ago, there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a desire to head off in a new direction, because there will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the incalculable investments that underlie current patents. there is nothing fundamentally not functional about how the federal circuit is approaching this question. it has had decades to look at this to try and elaborate a standard. this court in cases like sakraida and 
but it's odd that they didn't say that. their  the reasons they gave were that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.
for equitable tolling? well, i 2 don't know that the government would accept equitable 3 tolling.
you say that someone can be enjoined 
would it  would it if the employer were self-insured? can you be self-insured for workers' comp?
where would we find that?
as it is to us, right? (laughter.)
it is a 
 what we do have is candidates  even though it is possible to run effective campaigns in vermont for lower amounts, candidates nevertheless go out and raise often much more than what they need. here's an example from the record. we had senate candidate vincent illuzzi. in 1998, he raised $39,000, almost $40,000, for his senate campaign. his challenger was able to raise almost nothing. he only spent $30,000 worth of that. candidates don't need $39,000 or $30,000 to run an effective senate campaign, but an incumbent that builds a war chest has the ability to deter serious challenges.
are you trying to get those in this case?
i understand, but what's significant here is when she is flopping around, the reason she comes up with  she says gender. it's patently unconstitutional and discriminatory. we have youth, and then she says, well, it's not that they're younger. other young people on the jury. it's not that i don't want young people. and she doesn't strike juror 15.
section 1519, i don't think you can. could you have done that in the  in the fall of 2001? yes, your honor, you could. what that really reflects is the pettibone rule. the pettibone rule, for a hundred years, was that destruction and other kinds of acts of potential obstruction in advance of a proceeding were not a crime.
well, i think he can also reject an appointed counsel. can't he go to the court and say, i  you know, i don't like this counsel?
not in the record of this case, justice kennedy.
correct. and here i think it might be less than burglary. and extortion, though one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or something and revealing a secret from the past  many such crimes are threats of violence. i mean, and that just read through the statutes, and that's what they are aiming at. so i would say extortion is something that official quite often could involve violence. but again that's cogitating. so i get to attempted burglary. i don't know. now what do i do?
general clement.
but the reason is there are two separate questions. they just happen to be identical. but i mean, the state court isn't going to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not. it doesn't have to answer that question, but it may well have to answer the question whether it's preempted. it happens to be the same analysis, at least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't meant that you  that just because a review of the removal decision  the remand decision is  is precluded, that review of the preemption decision is precluded.
no. in fact, precisely for that reason, the officers would not need a telephonic warrant in that situation no more than they would need a telephonic warrant in this situation. time is of the essence. violence 
i think that that was what the holding in the majority opinion was, but i think, as justice thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion, the effect of that is to allocate the risk of non-persuasion to the state. and so i think that that's  i could be wrong, but it seems to me a semantic point. and to justice stevens' question, as you pointed out in your concurrence in brecht, the kotteakos standard which this court adopted in brecht is an exacting standard. and in applying that standard, if you'd look at this case, the court's decisions, sullivan, kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the jury. here we have a jury in the third trial that deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days 
the other question i have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?
that's correct, your honor.
well, i don't know about that. she was in the living room.
well, i think so long as the district court can evaluate and consider and potentially reject what the guidelines say, just as the court can consider the effect of  of the person's military record, mr. rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which is separate and apart from someone who may have been an army recruiter 
i think it is undeniable  and mr. minear can speak on behalf of the ftc to this. i think it is undisputed that the government understood that this joint venture was a consolidation of both the refining assets of the two companies, as well as the marketing functions of the two companies, and that it would own the gasoline and it would decide how to sell it and what price to sell it at. i don't 
that's what we run into here, is a total frustration almost of congress' time limiting.
it expressly incorporates it, yes. yes. but the  but the operative provision is section 1101(a)(43) of the ina, and there are three features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion. the first is that the consequences of aggravated felony status under the ina turn on whether one is convicted, not whether they have committed the crime, and that's true both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under 1326 and the  and the immigration consequences. and we think it makes particular sense when you're talking about a conviction to look about how the  to look at how the official crime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction.
and those provisions are specifically recited to apply only to reentrants after the effective date.
either way.
is there  is there any on  on that? is there any indication? i mean, i've never seen any either way, to tell you the truth, but  that madison or jefferson or whoever, when they were writing the constitution, would have thought what happened elsewhere, let's say, in britain or in the british  they were a british colony. they did think blackstone was relevant. did any  that they would have thought it was totally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to the word unusual. is there any indication in any debate or any of the ratification conventions?
well, your honor, that  i certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that we would be relying on at trial or at summary judgment to support our case, but in our motion to dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support our case.
 the 
i'm talking about your case. what's left?
 you're exaggerating the effect of that statement.
then your answer is no, we would not have jurisdiction in that event.
of course they're not. that's why some of them were oversubscribed. that's why others were undersubscribed.
suspicionless search?
well, under these facts, it was sufficiently adverse because she lost pay. now, in a  in a theoretical sense, if she had not lost pay, that still could be adverse under 704(a). it depends upon the effect and the motive. i don't think that anyone would quarrel under 703 if an african american was suspended without pay because of race, that that would be actionable. why would it not be actionable in this context? there's a difference between damages and whether or not there's actionability under this one little part of  of the claim. perhaps if she was  was suspended for a retaliatory motive and 5 days later she was returned, she may have no damages, and  and the claim might  but in terms of 
the answer is yes, i take it.
 most people it wouldn't matter. but 
we 
what does, what does he have?
and were those magnet schools? and could you tell me about that?
i don't disregard it.
well, you say it's a state of indecision. the jury has decided that aggravating factors have been established.
yes, your honor, it is.
the pricing didn't 
 in the case 
well, there is  isn't there the problem  at least ohio suggested that there is  that if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form says so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you, those persons who came forward might not live to see another day?
assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.
thank you, mr. digges.
yes, but if your  if your argument is sound, mr. phillips, then  then any employer is well advised to define job categories by having one really nice job within the category and one really rotten job within the category. and if anybody who's got the nice job does something like make a title vii complaint, automatically gets, in effect, reassigned to the rotten job, and your answer will be, you know, there's no economic effect. they're getting the same amount of money each week. i mean, that would seem to me  asks for an end run around the whole concept of retaliation.
but were they, in fact, enforcing that standard? so that  you said that duke could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at the time duke started up its 
i'm reading at the bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.
my question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. but this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what i want to hear why.
do we  do we ever take the position that what we do here should influence what people think elsewhere?
thank you, mr. hurt. mr. driemeier, we'll hear from you.
well, what's the point of the limitation in ssrs to $10 if the state can impose any additional fee it wants just by calling it a different name?
no, no, no. it  it referred to the two houses, one on cimmaron.
that's correct.
if it wishes. if it wishes.
i think that it has proven administrable. and it  it  i think that the majority of courts allow you to look at court documents in order to determine what was  what sort of offense was at issue and  and that 
 and had  needed 
it would be extremely strange especially because there's the lack 
justice breyer, that is certainly possible, and i think that is why congress has said you don't have an absolute right as a debtor under section 707 to dismiss your chapter 7 case.
that  no, please.
no. it wouldn't have to do  i mean, fairly  you know, to be fair, it wouldn't have had to say that. it would have said any  any act that is discrimination under 703. any act that is discrimination under 703. seven words it could have said.
yes, in this case.
yes, but i think we should  the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may freely discriminate against people in the casinos and so forth when they're on the high seas.
thank you, mr. perry. mr. frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.
well, why would the person want if he thought that? i mean, why would a person want a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave him the power to raise price above what the price would be in its absence?
the california courts are certainly not tolerating  and, in fact, this case was heard by a california court, and the  and the judge, as i read the record  it's not altogether clear  seemed to agree with the  with the police officers.
the other question i had, are these two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in other cases where it was determined that they had used tactics that violated batson? were those cases contemporaneous with miller-el's or were they earlier in time?
 in good company, but 
yes.
they  they could have, and they'd be  they'd be fighting the same anti-lien issue there that they ended up fighting in federal court. but there's one other thing too. keep in mind these third party liability provisions 
well, justice ginsburg, that's not the question before the court. the question before the court is whether the eighth amendment was violated and whether the jury had a reasonable opportunity, and in 
okay, but the problem, i guess  focus the problem this way. the, the stenberg opinion talks about substantial medical authority as triggering this requirement for a statutory element. that problem is not focused simply by saying congress made some findings and the district court made other findings and congress should prevail. the fact is the substantial medical judgment finding i would suppose is satisfied by the, by the record in the district courts in these cases. this is not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is substantial medical judgment. if we are going to defer, as you say we should defer to congress, haven't we got official to overrule that statement?
thank you, mr. dreeben. ms. brill, you have four-and-a-half minutes left.
 with the 
suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. and the district court said, the only way i can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because i'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), i think. can the district court do that?
the prisoner may know best whether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether or not he appealed. the prisoner may not know precise dates on which he or she did so or have copies of the grievances anymore. this really kind of brings the heightened pleading rule, not just whether it's just affirmative defense or a general pleading rule, to the fore. prisoners are prisoners. they get moved around, they get put in administrative segregation; they are subject to repeat searches; they have great difficulty in maintaining possession of their belongings. on the other hand the michigan department of corrections keeps copies of all the grievances, denials and appeals.
so, if we disagree with you on the treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't really even address the point whether or not this and/or the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.
mr. kneedler, may  would you clarify just one point about this probable cause? there was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then there was a trial judge who said, i'm throwing this out at the close of the government's case. there is not enough evidence here to convict this man. are you saying that as long as the grand jury indicts, there can be no bivens claim because in order to indict, the grand jury would have had to find probable cause?
can he get injunctive relief? can he get injunctive relief? you said something about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated taking. can he have this litany of things that have happened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those 
it could have come from my chambers. (laughter.)
i thought your answer before was that this is not  if she's going to bring a case i got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, i'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that i get equal pay, so today i'm not getting equal pay, i thought  i mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil.
we are advocating the tests set out in the idaho case, your honor. that test is a two-pronged test.
it was quoted in the petition for rehearing.
it's  this is not like you sign an agreement and you're  you can do it or you can not do it. i mean, this is a real hobson's choice, isn't it?
i understand that a person could have an ideological objection to the content of the ad. but the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in this area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license plate that says, "free speech, or die," or "freedom" 
they may not be covered 
but it wasn't textually as nice as that?
and are we making any differentiation at all between the mini color red or whatever, and this logo that appears?
you concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?
if  if you want to say that the members committee are the board of directors, justice breyer, okay. but in fact and in truth, it is the  it is shell and texaco, independently without any conversation with the representatives of equilon, who are doing this. what differences this from  from northern securities and  and any of the other cases in which the board of directors, so-called, were the former major competitors  what difference what form they take  and they 
yes.
i think that  i think that is one of the factors to be considered.
respectfully, justice ginsburg, that's not the question before the court, though. we're trying to determine in this case whether the state courts unreasonably determined that these juries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence. and i think looking at argument, when we're determining the reasonableness of that decision, looking at counsel's argument is all we have to go on in determining whether the jury had a fair shot. now i think if you look back at the '90s 
it is for this reason, mr. chief justice. before, you could file successive applications. in the early days of habeas corpus, you could file successive applications. and the reason given was there was no appeal. and so you could go from one judge to the next judge because there were no appeals. then, of course, we had appeals, and the reason for having successive petitions would diminish. but what has happened to the appeal in a habeas corpus case is it has become so constrained that in many respects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here. here's my client who faces a situation in which he has clearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes to the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and can't get past the gateway of the certificate of appealability. and so he has no opportunity to really have an appellate review. he has none.
 that was an individual attribution. you, yourself, had 
your honor, if i may explain with two points. one, there is a common theme on the texas capitol grounds, just as there are on most capitol grounds and on the national mall. and the common theme is to recognize historical influences in our country and in our state.
i mean, the text  the text only  only says, shall  which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits. extent of coverage or benefits. i don't know that that relates to any of them. it relates to whether the benefit that was covered has been waived.
well, i  i read it as saying, and therefore i'm going to be careful about finding that there's been a batson violation. and i wonder if that's consistent with what we want trial judges to do when they're hearing batson challenges.
why? i  your answer didn't  didn't tell me why.
no 
why then would a decision to order psychiatric testing qualify? because it says, or any other. right?
the minute 
what the washington supreme court held is that the  what was argued in the washington supreme court generally is that this is a violation of the union's right to engage in political advocacy.
no. no, if it's  if it's a lawful joint venture and it's selling gasoline  there's no retaining of prior brands  the joint venture sets the price. and if the  and all those people you said suffered when equilon did this, those same number of people would have suffered if they're selling equilon gasoline at a price determined by the joint venture. it seems to me a very artificial hook that you're trying to hang your case on, which is they retained for presumably legitimate brand competition reasons their separate brands, but that was the decision of the joint venture. and again, the joint venture has to be able to price its product whether it's sold as equilon or whether it's sold as texaco or shell under  under the same  same joint venture.
that's right. but you know, the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that this is not filling in the gaps in direct review. we're not going to give you 
i think there could be, justice kennedy. i don't want to overstate it, in the sense that  one of the reasons you don't see that much of a conflict between federal and state law in the regulation of controlled substances is because, in the main, the states have adopted uniform controlled-substances acts that mirror the federal act, and, in most of the instances there, works in the way of cooperative federalism in dealing with this problem. this court tends to see the cases  raich, in this case  where there's a conflict between the state regime and the federal regime. and i guess my point is the  in a such a comprehensive federal regime, if this court makes clear that state law can overtake the federal regime, i think it at least creates the potential for there to be a lot of holes in the regime and the possibility, if states take the  take you up on that invitation 
or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?
correct.
your honor, the 760 money  excuse me. the 760 money is not the union's money until they have satisfied the conditions laid out in the statute, in this case section 760. possession of the fees does not entitle the wea or any union to use those fees to influence an election or operate a political committee until after they have satisfied the condition on that collection, the condition being in this case they have to obtain affirmative authorization. this court held in phillipson and brown that, analogizing to that money, that non-members own the fees until the statutory conditions are satisfied.
is there a conflict on the circuits on that point? i don't know.
that's right.
well, we would intend to call her.
at page 7 of your brief you say: "school districts have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation." if i put a period in there, then i would get to my strategic site selection, and i still haven't got your answer on that. you don't put a period there. you say: ". .have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation through race-neutral means." and this brings up this same question justice ginsburg had. isn't it odd jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in another set of terms, unless your answer is that individual classification by race is, is impermissible, but other, more broad measures based on, with a racial purpose are all right?
yes.
well, they confer with each other. maybe, maybe.
yes. we believe under the authority of this court in those three-judge courts, that is the solution that this court has established 
 and there are disability 
okay. why don't you concede that of course that would be exposing the jury to an improper influence, in the "hang musladin" case.
how many prosecutions for political corruption have you brought?
but not neatly, i mean, in terms of the purposes of the thing. are your clients claiming that it would violate the establishment clause for the president to go to lots and lots of prayer breakfasts?
sure. and the montana statute, which reads precisely the way arizona's is, they've decided the equipoise issue and said that the language of that statute does not mandate death by equipoise. so, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's simply no other state that has a statute which mandates death by equipoise. in any event, the kansas supreme court did interpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by-equipoise provision, which the state's question presented assumes is the case. and the court, familiar with the way the statute has operated, and is likely to operate it in kansas, found that equipoise can happen, and that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing in a way that's forbidden by the eighth amendment. and i think one of the problems here is that the terminology of "weighing" conveys a false impression of predefined weights. and the attorney general conceded that that's not how juries consider the balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. and we agree with that. and that's why it is wrong to view this as principally a burden-of-proof issue. it's not. the issue, at the selection stage  the state certainly has the burden to prove an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, but, at the selection stage, the issue is not meeting some particular burden of proof, it's whether the jury has made a reliable, responsible, collective decision that this unique defendant deserves the death penalty that distinguishes him 
so as long as  as long as somebody is  is engaged in a navigation 
yes, your honor. the  the government, for the first time, here in this court has unveiled a new doctrine that hadn't been in the case before. it's no longer relying on either the waiver for all time or the sort of mini-waiver for the  the january delay. but it argues that petitioner is estopped from challenging the 90-day delay in 1997. there are several problems with the government's argument, but the most obvious one is that the only conduct that the government cites to trigger the estoppel is the waiver.
to say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. so under the federal system, it is perfectly possible  unless, unless we hold otherwise  for a judge to give a sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to be affirmed, because although the guideline range is reasonable, there are other systems that would be reasonable, right?
and i 
i mean, what does it take if  can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong here?
mr. olson, suppose just the dealers in new york, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price. would that be lawful?
your 
yes, justice stevens. the  the test under section 2 is results, and that goes 
thank you, mr. elwood. ms. thompson, you have a little over 3 minutes.
thank you, mr. mitchell. the case is submitted.
 who recognized 
it determined the validity of  of a pourover trust. is that correct?
 that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?
but your  your problem with that, as i understand it, is simply that at that point with all these chains and so on, he's giving an impression or the state is requiring him, in effect, to give an impression to the jury that may be a  a false impression.
that's real neat. i have never heard of that before. [laughter.]
that's true. but that's getting the cart before the horse. what this court said in 
 it didn't cure. i mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?
 that the circuits all agree with you. now, my only problem is it's hard for me to see why they all agree with you. (laughter.)
but it seems to me that to be equal in weight is not to predominate. and that's all the jury is saying 
mr. hungar, what is the tentative decision the fcc has taken on the dsl regulation?
may  let me just add quickly. i  i realize, of course, there's going to be some movement of voters, but do we have any idea whether the voters who are moving are the ones who would otherwise have stayed at home anyway and done nothing, merely nominal republicans as opposed to active republicans?
am i right in thinking  i just want to clarify this  that in the circuit court, they applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a standard that sounds a lot like ellerth, the kocsis, or whatever it is? tangible employment actions, a significant change in employment status, hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits. and that's basically what the jury was instructed.
that's right. by pendent jurisdiction what, what i meant to convey was that it is within the court's article iii jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims that were pendent to a federal claim. under this court's judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, that is discretionary with the court. but if it is official discretionary with the court, then certainly congress can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction and that it would be consistent with article iii. but another reason why congress would have wanted the case to remain in federal court even if the certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to before, the development of the case subsequent to the certification substitution decision may, may illustrate that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that were within the scope of employment. the court would at the very 
isn't that an example where there's a violation of the fourth amendment that is brought up and yet suppression is not the 
do we look to what is socially acceptable? is there some language to that effect in some of our cases?
well, it, it's trying to seek, establish a new reciprocal arrangement. regardless of why it was back in the position of having to do so, it did so in a way that it did in any number of other situations that did arise.
well, i think in all likelihood, it is the latter. certainly i would think that the court would presume  would not presume ill of local school districts and  and even state universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. the second point is that what the  the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title ix's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.
so what is it other than  is this arbitrary and capricious?
may i ask this question? because i know your time is short. supposing michigan imposed a new $10 fee per  and it identified it precisely as in order to comply with that statute and then reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would that be permissible?
yes, they  they might have  they might have done that. and i  i acknowledge that this consideration is not controlling, standing by itself, on the case. that is, if the statute plainly and unambiguously called for such an implausible outcome, then we might have a debate about whether an absurd outcome that the plain language calls for is one that should be enforced. but this is a background consideration that i don't think the court can put aside or deem irrelevant to the outcome of this case. so the key holding of the fourth circuit was that the word located has an unambiguous meaning, and it's  that it's the one adopted by the fourth circuit majority and not by the fourth circuit dissent, the fifth circuit, the seventh circuit, the comptroller of the currency, or anybody else. the battle of the dictionary definition seems to me plainly inconclusive. the biggest problem with the definitions is that they are cast in terms of the location of tangible physical things, a table, a lake, a piece of land; whereas we're dealing here with an incorporeal abstraction, a corporation, the location of which is not necessarily tied to any particular physical presence. both we and the government have given ford motor company as an example in the brief. if you ask somebody where is ford motor company located, i venture to say that most people would say michigan. but when you stop and think about it, it's possible that it could be also located every place where it has manufacturing facilities or sales outlets. the only dictionary definition that i've seen that is specific to the location of an incorporeal entity, and specifically a bank, is the one that's cited in the chase  jpmorgan chase amicus brief, which was taken from the 1951 edition of black's law dictionary, roughly contemporaneous with the enactment of current section 1348, which states that a bank is, quote, located, close quote, in the place specified in its organization certificate. the term also appears many places in the national bank act, sometimes meaning a specific headquarters location and sometimes meaning any place where there are physical facilities. and the court  this court itself has given located  the word located various meanings. in the bougas case, which is much discussed in the briefs, the court said that the term has no enduring rigidity, and the court did not base its decision on the inherent or natural or ordinary meaning of the word located. in federal power commission v. texaco, which is 377 u.s. 33, the court interpreted the words in the venue statute for appeals from federal power commission decisions which said the appeal could be taken to the place where the company seeking review was located. texaco said, well, we have substantial facilities in the tenth circuit. this matter that is the subject of this arose in the tenth circuit. and the court looked at the statute and it said, no, located means where  your place of incorporation. now 
mr. dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.
yes, your honor.
is that the only basis for venue? i mean, i thought the statute provides that's just one of the bases for venue.
well, it wouldn't have to use a tax to do that. it owns the station. it would 
no, your honor, because here the court need not go beyond the face of the district court's order to understand what it was doing. the court exercised jurisdiction over the federal question that was properly brought before it by the attorney general's certification and this court's decision in lamagno. after resolving that, the district court said, having concluded that the united states is not a proper party to this case, the court must now determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it also said that the absence of the u.s. as a party to the case destroys the court's jurisdiction. so it's evident that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.
yeah.
okay.
that's our position.
absolutely. and it's in the regulations. the right-of-way has to be reassigned, and it wasn't going to be reassigned because respondent refused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because he refused to make rental payments.
didn't  wasn't there a statement that he was indifferent between death and life imprisonment?
mr. chief justice, it turns out that actually is not accurate.
you don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case. ex ante you can't tell.
that's right.
it may be pending in state court during the further proceedings, but it's not pending during the time that it is at this court, because this court has not 
and your question is whether  -
i could  i could see your argument, if, for example, in the tax exchange case, there was not taxation being made of the out-of-state transactions. but that was the case in 
ms. brinkmann, am i right that they were, "they" being kp, they were in fact using the word "micro color" before you registered your trademark?
and we would point out that as a textual argument and the purpose argument 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i thought your hypothetical 
so, if your date  if the principal activity is donning and doffing, then the walking time thereafter would also be included.
yes, your honor.
well, that would not  presumably that would not be a method of execution at all.
what did the jury hear about muncey's confession?
 if mom 
this  the terms of this injunction.
i  i don't know. i mean, it's 
the solicitor general hypothesized one in the amicus briefs. if somebody  you know, they  they burst in and someone screams, you know, run away, it's the police, that excited utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce would presumably be related to the violation and could be suppressed. that doesn't mean that the gun and the drugs that are found in the room is in the same category.
let me 
whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to pike church.
well, suppose a company has a plan to defraud the government and it use a certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the real fraud is. and it puts it in place and it puts it in place in 1988. and the  and it has just two containers full of this. and the relator knows about it. the relator then quits. then for 10 years the company does the same thing, following the same patterns, same method, same improper formula. and he then rings  he then brings this to the attention of the government in the proper way and files a suit. he cannot recover for the later action which was the same pattern, practice?
yeah, but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent  contributory negligence, that's not what we have here. we have here a difference in the causation. intentional or non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. but once you say that there's a difference in the causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. you cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using the same kind of a standard. i mean, let's assume that you find that the official railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly contributory to it. what do i do? do i add another 40 percent to his culpability because it was  his causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?
so, that 
so his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued.
i thought the argument you were making a few minutes ago, if i understood it correctly, was that b.c. hydro would not have been barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the remand; is that correct or not.
if the manufacturer makes up reports, it has committed a felony. epa can enforce it. it can refer it to the attorney general. it's just like the 
i mean, they're 
based on shore, but so are the passengers.
no, but is  is your point that once you get beyond the documents that you admit we can look at, there is a higher  an  an unacceptably high risk of unreliability? is that your argument?
but there may be other aspects of the test that aren't met 
 that's wonderful policy, but i don't  what i'm still waiting to hear is how you get that out of the definitions, which is the lever that the commission is using to implement this good policy. it is saying, in some cases, that a bundled offering is an offering of telecommunications; and, in other cases, it's saying a bundled offering isn't. and the reason, you say, is not because of the nature of the thing, because of the definition, it's because you tell us it has good consequences in one case, and doesn't have good consequences in the other.
2254(d)(1), i think the only way that you can read that section compatibly with the four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2 of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to recognize, although this court will recall that it has described aedpa as not quite a silk purse of legislative drafting, but the only way to make those sections compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when 2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is who is it decided by, because before aedpa was adopted it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by this court, that established by the rule. so that's the first part. and the second part is that it's not dicta. it is an actual holding of this court that is to be looked to to determine whether or not the state court was wrong. and so the only way to read that is to say, listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity, and what does retroactivity mean? retroactivity means like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined that a new rule is retroactively applicable  and certainly between aedpa and the teague exceptions, which you did say in horn versus banks, by the way, should be analyzed differently  although it has not been tossed up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that teague is still alive and well and that when you look to the application of whether a rule should be applied retroactively you look to the teague exceptions, so we also look 
 between access and allowing the speech, but i think it  you have to be  -
it ought to be out of the general fund.
no, no. but the instruction that was given  and one was read that's in the briefs  it seems to me a  a perfectly good instruction.
thank you, mr. kneedler. mr. long, you have 4 minutes remaining.
you may.
as a 
well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute.
no.
well, i don't agree, your honor, because there's a specific analysis that goes along with rule 15 that wasn't applied here. but, in addition to that, there's an efficiency interest to be served by having the state calculate and make the motion, rather than putting the burden on the federal court to do it. the court, we submit, should make the state  they  this court, in pliler, said the state's in the best position to make the limitations calculation. it's an error-prone fact-intensive, burdensome calculation, and they shouldn't be allowed to foist that burden on the court. the court should make them do their job. and so, our position is that that's the reason that it should be done under rule 15. it also doesn't put the state in the position of being an advocate  excuse me  it doesn't put the court in the position of being an advocate for the state and having them say  having the court directly across the bench from the petitioner, not involving the state, saying, "here are  i'm developing some arguments on behalf of the state now why this is untimely. what do you have to say about it?" that's 
it's not relevant. it's relevant to that termination. yeah, the issue is, is there an immediate risk. but one of the factors that is significant is what is the severity of the underlying crime. and if it is a crime of violence, then certainly the officer is entitled to presume 
we  we can't  you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari 
oh, you think pre- and crime  pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case? i thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?
well, i'm talking about the full tax court, your honor. if the full tax court reviews an individual tax court judge's decision, the tax court judge has presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like the special trial judge here, and then the full tax court judge reviews it. that's exactly what happened in the estate of varian case, which is in our briefs, out of the ninth circuit. the parties complained that they wanted access to the original judge's report because he had been reversed  been reversed by the full court after trial on an  on an evidentiary issue, and the ninth circuit said no.
and when the trial judge 
may i interrupt 
i see, your honor, yes.
yeah.
well, maybe a critical witness was left out. that argues the other way, i think.
a federal defense does not support the federal jurisdiction, but the declaratory judgment act gives jurisdiction over federal questions.
do  do you disagree with ms. karlan that this is  this is a standardized product so the people, the rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made ira? they would have to take the standard product.
so, discrimination 
i'm sorry, can you 
conceivably, but the federal question statute allows us to raise federal claims in federal court, and through it, congress has determined that if the case turns on federal law, that the federal forum is an appropriate forum for that.
 does that make a difference?
thank you.
well, i don't think so, justice souter. i mean, i think the disagreement is more fundamental than that. what i would say is, a claim could be brought in the tribunal that the geneva conventions apply. now, just because the geneva convention does apply 
do you know any case, mr. castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different u.s. court to get a different resolution?
yes. and in fact, everyone now who has, say, a brady claim is going to have  under third circuit law as it is now, is going to have to come into federal court and file a protective habeas petition because the odds are very likely that more than a  the aedpa year is going to run while they litigate this.
that's correct, your honor.
the grievance.
if we came out the way i just described 
thank you, ms. bergmann. mr. feldman, we'll hear from you.
i think the corporation would, your honor.
may i ask just a  kind of a background question? i noticed the judge pointed out after ruling that he was under  he  i can't remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an obligation to report its reasons for granting wheeler motion to the state bar.
you did 
yes, it could, your honor. and i would refer you to rule 4.410 in our appendix, page 2 and 3, that the general policy considerations that over  that overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing system, include deterrence for this defendant and deterring others from committing the same crime, that you can just look to the  what is happening in this particular neighborhood, as the examples brought out.
is it  is it unlawful to take sex into account in jury selection?
that 
all right. so 
well, the five  the 5-year period that petitioners  mr. gossett was referring to, i think, relates to the period after the point in time at which somebody's deported or removed. and so, his initial deportation 
and whether a private individual can come and offer them the same protection for less money or not?
but you say "incorporated," though. what it did was it took the language and it did not take 
so i  i take it your point then on the combined corruption/competition for money problem is that there isn't any record that would support it.
 90 percent of them want to say.
right. right.
it shows nothing? none of the supporting documentation shows what it was?
it would be on the district court's docket for ten years waiting the final 
no. it's not 
okay. now, let me ask you  you one other question. you  you started out in getting down to first principles with disfavor of warrantless arrests. would your position be different if the officer had somehow gotten an arrest warrant on the spot for illegal taping? wouldn't you be making the same argument?
yes, that's all correct, your honor. but if there were no provision of the rule that reserved decision under 50(a), i would still say that the denial of the 50(a) motion should be appealable when the judgment is entered, because the  all of the prior orders of the court merge into that judgment when it's entered.
the warrant itself.
can i just go back to, you mentioned my question.
your honor, the  if they're going to enter the home, there has to be, obviously, a serious situation that's going to arise. and so with the  the presentation which you presented, it's not serious enough to require the sidestepping of a warrant in the situation.
correct.
but the claim doesn't require that.
would it make any difference? there seemed to be some suggestion that there are stereotypes at play in these batson cases.
i believe that's correct, your honor, because the ninth circuit did not reach that issue.
thank you, counsel. mr. dreeben.
well, do you  do you say, going back to  to the point justice ginsburg made, if the united states follows a 48- to 72-hour rule, is  is that a violation of the treaty?
i have a question. does the record tell us, the 300 people who have failed to get into the schools they wanted, the racial composition of that group?
how many prosecutions like this have there been? when was the first one?
well, justice stevens, i think that even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear just that issue and 
it's a way of phrasing it.
well, i, i  the court certainly can do it. it would require carving a hole into, into tomiano with this 
well, first of all, the  the remedy that the petitioner here proposes is one that congress has not proposed, for openers. and secondly, the petitioner acknowledges at page 33 of their brief that they had no veto power over the settlement. the settlement was a matter for 
the plea colloquy was not ever presented or produced, and it does show that they came from police reports.
it  it is likely, your honor  and we have previously said  that we may very well dismiss the case of our own accord. but that doesn't mean 
if you don't agree with us 
well, the question is would he 
if that's the evidence, i think i win.
the  at the  at the very essence of that, i don't believe that a contract can preempt state law. the constitutional laws of the united states can preempt state law. if somehow you can bootstrap a contract into that by some theory, i suppose you could argue that it  that it 
first impression.
but your position is that the attorney general's certification is conclusive  is not conclusive in those situations in which the attorney general doesn't draw the line properly between an event denying answer and an event characterizing answer? whenever the attorney general is wrong on that very nuanced decision in some instances, then the attorney general's certification is not conclusive?
i'm sorry. my act must read differently. my act says in (4), any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent. it doesn't say anything about 30 days.
but he had one in, from the past, which  which his predecessor had given a reciprocal easement for, and the government failed to record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.
justice scalia, that is absolutely correct, but the difference is where compacts have mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these differences, i think it is in the court's interest  and colorado's position is and the special master's position was it was in the court's interest  to refer these matters back to those compact administrations. you 
well, that was  that was a rule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases. and, as pointed out by the government, habeas cases are fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases, is very vague. it's just, you know, what the event was, "i got hit by a train." you don't have to say, "wherein, the train was negligent  or the railroad was negligent," or anything else; just, "i got hit by a train." whereas, with respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that require specifying all the grounds for relief available to the petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground. it seems to me that those different pleading requirements suggest that what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.
if  if, if indeed that's, that's what he's aiming at, low price. is it the object of the  is the sole object of the sherman act to produce low prices?
because the  the underlying terms are part of the government contract and 
it said the words. they violated the words. it was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?
i think its reasoning stands on its own, your honor. but in addition to that case, you have these other three published cases, and we stand by the description of them in our argument. kansas v. adams was a case where the court said the issue  the state's evidence shows this baby died within a certain time period, and although the wife had a history of violence against the child, the court said it's not getting in because it's  there's no evidence that she had access to the child during the relevant time period. that's a very clear example. there are other examples.
on the other  no, they  see, it  he put it on the porch, which is transmitting it, in such a way that it fell open. but i'm just trying to think  and then the  on the other side of it, you have the automobile accident. and i guess he comes along the street, the postman, swinging my package around, and bops someone on the head with it. i guess that's covered. and then, this case is somewhere in the middle.
what the 
but that argument could be made with respect to a person who is in the united states, who is subject to a term of probation where the only condition is that he not further violate the law. in that 
may i ask this? are you suggesting that a county could be an arm of the state for some purposes but not for others?
well, i thought your test was if she knows that he's a police officer, it's testimonial.
you  you think that the  the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good, and  and then the trial court proposes an alternative, or  or invites the state to propose to the trial court an alternative, and then asks whether you agree to that alternative. and if you don't, the trial court makes the decision whether the alternative is  is constitutional or not.
other statutes don't view the one as  as being incorporated in the other.
well, mr. chief justice, that slices the baloney the way this court's cases have sliced the baloney, and that  the rule is that there has to be a substantial question of federal law. there is one when the action depends on the meaning of federal law, but not one where everybody agrees on the meaning of federal law and all that's at issue is a dispute about the facts. now, this case, as i said, does fall within the hopkins line of cases, and in each of those cases, the court held there was arising-under jurisdiction in a quiet title action where the plaintiff's claim that it had superior title to the land in question depended on the meaning of federal law. and, of course, that's true here. the quiet title action provides the mechanism for review of this question, but the question is entirely one of federal law as to who has the superior interest in the land, the tax sale purchaser or the taxpayer. if the court has no further questions.
 statute of repose.
it can, your honor, but 
well, we know under the statue they can dismiss a case because it's frivolous, right?
well, it is the same old record we've been playing. but the reasonableness requirement has to be explained further. and when you explain it further, you find that there must be findings by a preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are set out. that's different from the objectives of sentencing.
so you are in effect, you would say that the rule should be, or the modified taylor rule for application here should be that it's either got to fall within the concept of the federal offense, or in default of there being a comparable federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference to state practice?
just let me just ask one  one thing i am curious about. the argument  it seems to me that there's kind of a flow of these. some of them get out of this system and some stay a long time. what does the record tell us about how often, if they conform to the regular rules without any violation for 40 days or a year, do they  do they get out of this  this situation?
no, but the answer  please, i didn't mean to cut off your answer.
so the extra fact then is a lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel aggravator? i mean, it's comparable to it?
i would like to address that, your honor, because i think that  that the seriousness of this evidence has been vastly overstated in the concurring opinion of the sixth circuit. the evidence itself was  was quite simply a deposition of a clinical psychologist who opined based on her  some additional  some additional meetings with family members and a review of the transcripts and other evidence that the petitioner suffered from a mental illness at the time of the offense.
maybe he meant the state supreme court.
he doesn't have to prove more likely than not at stage one, as i understand your position. he has to put in enough evidence from which a fact finder could find more likely than not if he accepts all the evidence as true and so on.
it absolutely would, your honor, because it would basically cover any kind of request. but, in addition, they say that under their definition what it really means is that if you did it for some other motive, if you got them to destroy the document so that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding  and that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding  and you bribed them to do it, but your motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a crime. under andersen's interpretation, it would still be a crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded them to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding, even if  at the appropriate time, if there is a nexus  because it doesn't matter whether you were trying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to keep it out of the  of the proceeding, of course that would be covered by the traditional definition of "corruptly persuade."
it's wrong under both, we would argue in our brief.
because 
yes.
well, mr. chief justice, that gets back to justice stevens' question as to whether or not these categories are mutually exclusive. i'm not here to tell you that appellants weren't genuinely issued about  genuinely interested about the filibuster issue. i think they were also, as their political action committee press release shows, genuinely interested in sending senator feingold packing. and they had an opportunity to run this ad and effectively get a twofer by naming senator feingold. now, they could have resisted that and only gotten the influence on the  the filibuster issue, if they had taken the 
so to make sure i understand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he names dr. x. and for whatever reason in the course of the response perhaps, he learned that not only was dr. x involved but dr. y was involved in that decision. so if he is denied relief at stage two, he says x and y, and he identifies x and why all the way through. he gets nothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to federal court. is it correct that under the sixth circuit rule they would say you have not completely exhausted because at stage one you did not mention y? is that correct?
it rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main  look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. that's  that's the classic retaliation claim. and that classic claim is surely covered by  on the basis of that person's sex. if 
 between new york state and the oneidas. now, that contained language which said the oneidas cede and grant all their lands to the people of the state of new york. that was the operative provision. later on, it  article 2 says, "of the ceded lands"  the ceded lands, lands that have been ceded  "a tract described by metes and bounds is reserved to the oneidas to hold to themselves and their posterity forever." now, i would normally interpret that to mean that the oneidas gave up all of their sovereignty over the lands and were given back, by the state of new york, the right over this tract designated by metes and bounds. now, i'm saying i would normally interpret that, except in a treaty with the indians. in a treaty with the indians, you say, "well"  and we have cases which have language somewhat like this, and they say, "well, they really didn't cede the part that they reserved." that may be the case in  ordinarily. but it seems to me, a basic principle of contract law  of treaty law, of any law  that where there is an ambiguous phrase or provision, you interpret it the way the parties themselves have interpreted it. and it seems to me that the subsequent history, after 1788, indicates that the oneidas believed that new york state had jurisdiction over that land.
yes, your honor. and the  once again, the important aspect, what's  the key aspect is whether or not a term is legally available, and whether or not there's a constraint that's imposed that takes away that legal availability as a threshold matter, rather than a reasonableness review requirement. california has consistently construed 1170(b) as imposing a reasonableness requirement. this court in booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not limit the availability of those upper terms.
what does that do to the effectiveness of regulation under the controlled substances act? if one state can say it's legal for doctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better, or to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that undermine the uniformity of the federal law and make enforcement impossible?
not a single one of them. now, of course, i've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that i have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.
so the  the question in this case is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence, isn't it?
as a prosecutor.
did  did you subpoena her at that point?
it's only play money, right?
well, what about hanson, and is it purkett v. elem?
well 
where 
justice ginsburg, you will know because of the evidence in the case. if the plaintiff, the defendant is able to show that they were storing up this extra input against a prospect of a price hike in the future or because they were out trying to get enough volume for some promotion for a customer that was going to significantly increase their purchases, then you'd have a different kind of case. we have a situation where they warehoused large, unprecedentedly high volumes of lumber because they 
if brooke group is applied 
no, but in that case there was a conflict between the interests of the third party and the interests of the litigant or a potential client. here there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.
the school could 
 be permissible?
the tribe has changed its position on that, i believe, in the course of the last 30 years but that is their current position. that it becomes subject to the nonintercourse act consistent with their position. with the court's permission, i want to, i do want turn to the 1788 treaty of fort schuyler and, time permitting, the 1794 treaty of canandiagua. our position on the treaty of fort schuyler i think is very plain in our papers and i just want to highlight what's in the rest of the treaty after article 1, which is a cessionable land. what's in the rest of the treaty is that new york reserved numerous rights even with respect to the reservation's land. new york had, among other things, the right to make and apply laws to the reservation, to enforce the treaty  and i'm quoting from article 4  in such manner as the state shall deem proper. new york had the right to enforce its criminal laws with respect to intruders on the reservation that new york granted to the oneidas obtaining the assistance of the oneidas to do so. new york, in the treaty, prohibited the oneidas from selling the lands. new york, in the treaty, prohibited the oneidas from certain length of leases and new york had the right to enact laws with respect to the leases that were permitted to enforce the leases. the other thing that one needs to look at in the context of the times, when looking at how would the oneidas have understood this, the tribes of the iroquois confederacy, knew how to preserve their aboriginal title when they wanted to do so and the oneidas didn't do that. in the 1797 big tree agreement with the senecas which is published at 7 statutes at large, 601, the senecas sold much of their lands through robert morris under the approval of the united states. in the agreement, the agreement provided that the reserved lands were, and i quote, "clearly and fully understood to remain the property of the senecas in as full and ample matter as if these presents had not been executed." that is the way an indian tribe understood preserving aboriginal title. that didn't happen in the treaty of fort schuyler.
yes, your honor. if it was  certainly, if it was against their conscience to do so 
that's correct.
winslow. you put it all around the room. all right, we've got it all around the room, and i begin to look at it and if i see over that it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it says, breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching and then it's obvious. now, maybe it doesn't have the teaching, it just has the suggestion. maybe it says, we suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's obvious. but i don't understand, though i've read it about 15 or 20 times now, it though i've read it about 15 or 20 times now, i just don't understand what is meant by the term "motivation."
and you concede that's pickering balancing, anyway.
well, no  i mean, that 
you don't have to say that. i mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to follow the words of the statute. and so whole or in part official makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't appear in section 53. why don't we just  why shouldn't the instruction just say, "such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury." it's not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate  the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence. why wouldn't that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?
well, but then  but then, in  you know, you know what's coming. you  the provision you rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of this  of a provision which requires written notice, opportunity to inspect records, and so forth. all those apply. but you have to say that (e) doesn't apply.
absolutely, your honor.
thank you, mr. himmelfarb. mr. reichman, you have, i think, 8 minutes left. 17 i'm not  i'm sure you don't really need all 8.
no. because the  the important thing is not just describing what actually happened, but what  what happened on the day the guilty plea was taken. and that is where the documents that record the plea i think come in to show 
well, miranda gives you the same, you know, right to  to reach a counsel, a right to remain silent, and yet, if your lawyer doesn't raise a miranda violation in trial, it can be waived.
you can equalize pay by lowering others. you don't  raising the discriminated-against class is not the only way to equalize pay. so i don't see how cost is a justification for continuing the disparity.
justice kennedy, the words that you articulated are essentially quotes of frazier and kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in those two cases than one might see in tinker. they of course drew, as you well know, from justice black's warning in dissent of tinker that the federal courts, federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly into the work of the school boards' 
 what do you 
well, were the  were the cues on the card similar to the instructions in the manual?
correct.
it was interpreted  exactly, yes. it was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug culture and 
i thought there was a section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.
but, mr. clement, it seems to me the spending clause aspect cuts in the other direction, if we're just focusing on the establishment clause. the fact that federal money is involved, why does that make your burden any less in defending the  the statute under the establishment clause?
and how about joint appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that franzen was not a partner in any entity responsible for managing the apartments in question?
and i think that would be 
if we break  if we break  whatever damage is done to the mail, and the package in the mail, the liquid in the mail cannot be sued over. that is  and i think petitioners agree  damage to and from the mail 
 that's correct, your honor.
 "we want a declaration of infringement." and the patent holder doesn't take the position that you're taking; instead says, "i'm prepared to fight this out now. i know that i have the license, which could be an affirmative defense, but i'm not going to raise it. i'm going to go head to head on the validity of this patent." would that be a case or controversy?
am i right in thinking that the government in 2000 opposed terminating this  the compulsory plan?
we'll hear from mr. stewart.
well, it's not like there's a habeas civil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas  habeas proceeding to be different. there is no counterpart to a tort action or a contract action where it's liberal pleading requirements under rule 8, and every single grounds for relief in a habeas proceeding there is a requirement that the prisoner actually identify all the grounds and the particular facts in support of that, and those heightened pleading requirements focus the proceeding on that particular transaction.
 and you look to all the statutes. for example, petitioner makes note of zipes, but if  if the jurisdictional statute is going to be the be all and end all of  of the analysis and the discussion, then zipes would have merely looked and said, oh, well, the statute of limitations is not in the jurisdictional provision. end of discussion. but zipes didn't do that. zipes said we need to look at the  the jurisdictional statute, the way it's structured. we need to look at congressional intent and the legislative history, how they referred to this matter. we need to look at our prior cases how we referred to this matter. so i think to say just, okay, let's look at the jurisdictional statute  one, i think there are two problems with it. one 
i don't, i don't know that there's no question about that. there's certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service.
may i ask you this question? if the attorney general determined that acupuncture was conduct that threatened the public health and safety, could he de-license, or revoke, the license of doctors who engaged in acupuncture?
is that a factor that goes into the analysis?
well, your honor, i think that the burdens in the prison environment are twofold. first, rluipa forces prison officials to change the balance they would otherwise strike between safety and accommodation, and by changing that balance, changing the margin of safety, if you will, they're now imposing risks on the other inmates that are in prison. and these aren't merely 
 accuracy of your statement that there is no other significant legitimate use.
no, no. no, i'm sorry, your honor. i  i must have misspoke. what i mean to say is that  that in the case where a  a diverse additional plaintiff comes in to bring a claim 
and when he was acquitted of that by a jury that took 20 minutes, and said that they were outraged by the blm, they found other things to do. they found other things 
if we amended the rules that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative defense. i mean, by definition an affirmative defense gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended the federal rules in practical terms it would be like adding an element to the claim.
that's fine. mr. schaerr.
yes, you certainly may. general clement.
but is it 
 engaged in, and, therefore, obstructs the effort to raise 
there's nothing magical about the fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated device. it has better detection capacity than a human being does. that's the only difference.
no, but they have the same interest that the bartenders had because they won't make some  sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't sell the booze. i don't see the difference.
well, the  for two reasons. first, the contract has to actually identify third party beneficiaries. in other words, parties need to agree on who the third  on who the beneficiaries are supposed to be. and here, of course, there's nothing in the contracts. they haven't alleged there's anything in the contracts to identify him as that. and also, if  if 
do you think the, on the same issue i think, that the addition of the deliberately and intentionally language in the congressional act addresses that concern?
what  what strikes me as strange about this  this system is  is not leaving it to the state courts to make these decisions. that's perfectly fine. we do that all the time. but these are decisions that are going to be conclusive on  on a federal claim, and yet there's no way to  to appeal from the state supreme court here.
had that not occurred before he was even tried?
the answer was they are at liberty  the police are at liberty to use dogs to find contraband. and your  illinois i think was very candid with the court in saying we have taken from your decisions that a dog sniff is not a search. so anything else is a matter of police policy. it had nothing to do with the fourth amendment.
the  the questions are very 7 significant, your honor. my  my instinct would be there 8 would be 
more than also. i  that seems to me the principal difference between this and rfra.
the income tax didn't exist. there  there couldn't conceivably have been an avoidance motive. so  so our holding could hardly be based upon  upon the existence of an avoidance motive.
well, justice ginsburg, there is no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes. what there are, are a set of cases that deal with specific problems in which foreign taxes were at issue. and in all of the 20th century versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign government, coming into another country seeking to use that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. and in that context, the justifications for saying that one country will not enforce another country's revenue laws have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host country. one country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to carry out its own governmental policies, is doing something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and there's no obligation of the united states to assist the foreign government in using its court system to achieve those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, either. as justice scalia pointed out, it's not unconstitutional, if congress wanted to allow it. but countries, historically, have not. and that principle does form an important backdrop 
they are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process. the question is whether that  when that is done, whether they also constitute an aggrieved party. and one of the  one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court. so doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?
you can finish your answer.
do you read the tolling provision in 2263(b) the same way as you read the tolling provision that's before us?
that would answer that question?
let me try to address each of those. first of all, the words were used as a definition of "improper purpose," and they were used together, "subvert, undermine, or impede," and they logically have a relationship to each other. when the court of appeals looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that the government was anticipated to make. and i think, "impede" has to be read logically in that group. now, i will acknowledge that "impeding" can have broader connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the obstruction 
well, the district court finding obviously chose to decide that the secular purpose for the display was to honor the fraternal order of eagles for their commitment to combating juvenile delinquency. but that is different  the purpose why the district court found why the display was constitutional is different than the message that is being sent to the reasonable observer.
well, maybe mr.  justice alito, if you knew that what the union was spending its money for was to improve, to increase cost of living adjustments for teachers or to reduce class size for teachers, or to enact tax levies in local school districts 
yes, your honor.
but it wouldn't fit under your 
but back to participation.
okay. then you think 
i think  i think the same rule would apply to any of the provisions where congress has specifically provided for a cause of action for the same reason, otherwise congress when  here, for example, just to return to attorney's fees for a second. when congress was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(b)(v) would be construed not to give attorney's fees, but not 
no. the manufacturer knew it didn't contain it. he falsely put that in the statement 
no, justice scalia, you have not held 
yes, your honor. his perceptions, the  the facts known to the arresting officers.
they may not be covered if they fail the last requirement 
 incurred as 
well, there seemed to be agreement that they couldn't have made their presence known because the noise inside was so loud that they would not have been heard.
justice scalia, and you asked whether i thought it was reasonable or not, and i would say it's not. the  the  to bypass that warrant requirement, to enter the home under an exigent circumstances, which is what they were there for, it's got to be more serious than a  a loud party, the situation. and ironically, the  the testimony of the officer, which i guess there was a dispute about whether that was there or not because it's not specifically in the findings that the trial judge made or the two appellate courts ruled on  but if the officer entered the home and shortly after that, i mean, he opened the door, according to his testimony, and announced, basically raised his voice, and they heard him, why cannot he have done that outside the home? and that's the situation. this wasn't a serious enough situation that he couldn't have made the effort to make his presence known outside.

whereas in  in this case, an employer does not normally go about providing phony id's or any id's for the people it hires. it says, who are you? what's your social security number? and  and there's  there's an affirmative act here.
yes, but you don't respond to one point in place, if i remember correctly. it must be a legitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing the dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you say there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in privacy?
is your argument an argument that the texas state court was wrong on its ruling under texas state law harmless error.
our view is that there are arguments that can be made that it does not because congress didn't 
then my second question is, have we decided, or is it a matter of common practice in california, that the application to the california supreme court is necessary in order to complete the exhaustion?
that strikes me as saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them to act.
maybe not, justice stevens. it just depends on the way that the statute deals with it. because, in my view of the statute, if somebody really thought  if they had to kill a human being, and they thought, "i wasn't doing it. i was killing an alien," maybe that could come in, on mens rea, but if 
 the what of 
which crime.
a joint 
may i 
no. there's a greater  i had this case in the d.c. circuit. there's a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with someone who's escaped from prison than with someone else who's being arrested. of course there's always the potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend someone who's escaped.
but haven't the jurors made the decision that, "we have looked at all of the moral arguments that he has presented. each of one of the  of us has individually weighed them. each one of us know that if we have any moral reason not to impose the death penalty, we can do it. and we make the moral judgment that we cannot make that determination."
but you  you don't really think we can hold that line, giving less favorable treatment to somebody who's  who's trying to argue against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him than somebody who's  who just wants to avoid 10 years in jail? that's just not going to work.
i read your 
i thought the state court didn't find that there was error. i thought the state court said, this was cumulative, i'm not going to let it in.
well, when you look at the  when you look at  at morales and brown, both of those that  that were proposed were eliminating  for instance, one of the options within mr. morales' case was that only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride. the state of california, for  for whatever reason, did not  did not choose that and went, instead, and tried to use the same protocol and bringing in anesthesiologists that were properly trained and qualified to determine whether or not mr. morales was, in fact, anesthetized to  to a degree where he would not feel that pain. that  that is  that is an example of a proper procedure being  being come up with  or being dealt with. as well, mr. brown  and  and thing is, is that for  there's  there's never been a requirement for  for us to plead this. the reason being is  is this court's case law within  for example, lewis v. casey shows the  the strong deference that this court gives to states in  in coming up with the prison procedures. that's not an execution case, but here the florida courts  not florida courts, but the florida officials within the department of correction  they know their facilities. they know what's capable of  of being done there or not.

but, you know, congress could have  could have written it the way  the way you're proposing it. congress could have said, you know, when there  when  when there is good cause for the continuance, the clock won't run. it didn't say that. it  it said the judge has to make a finding. i mean, don't we have to give that some effect? you're saying it really doesn't matter whether he makes the finding or not. so long as there was good cause so that a finding could have been made, that will be enough.
that's the prior case, because they made that.
no. they sometimes don't, but then if they don't, you appeal, just like anything else. and you might lose and you might not get your case taken in the supreme court. that's always true for every litigant.
mr. long seemed to have  tell us something different about that. it's  they had  they must go out. he seemed to say they didn't have the choice of staying in.
i don't know, your honor, whether the seventh circuit would follow up its presumption language by saying the presumption can only be overcome in extraordinary circumstances. that is, i don't know whether the seventh circuit sees its standard as the piggie park standard or as something slightly towards the middle from the piggie park standard. i think, in this case, we would win either way, but i would suggest that there is a systemic benefit from not having a multiplicity of standards, from having at least most attorneys-fee-shifting disputes be resolvable by, is it "almost always," is it "who knows," or is it "never, unless unreasonable"? i think there's a benefit to having nessatavite litigation over 
the 
i don't believe that is historical fact.
to the contrary. my point is we are not talking about just what a particular european treaty requires. we  the  the eight states that  that theoretically  that have statutes that theoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are not only alone in this country, they are alone in the world. every country in the world, including china and nigeria and saudi arabia and the  and the democratic republic of the congo, every one has agreed formally and legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only country besides the united states that has not is somalia, which as this court was reminded yesterday, has no organized government. it is incapable 
no, wait. what kind of an equitable doctrine?
justice souter, their burden is to show that if the court grants their requested relief it will redress their injuries. i'm not aware 
well, it is. the  the moment  the triggering event is the event that determines that the probable cause determination is, in fact, true now.
 justice.
but, your honor, congress found that state and local governments would retain the primary responsibility for making educational 
well, that isn't the compelling interest. the compelling interest is, we signed a treaty, and you follow it. now, how can you say that the government wouldn't have a compelling interest in following a treaty where they  where they promised to ban the substance? i mean, they're not  they're just saying rfra doesn't apply where that's at stake. now, what's the argument against that? you're saying the argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a compelling interest? well, okay. why not? i mean, it sounds to me as if it would be. they have a treaty. they have to live up to their word, period. what's wrong with that?
i mean, sure 
the  the only thing that they do say, your honor, is that they say that the strategy employed by mr. corin may well have been in mr. nixon's best interests.
there are some problems with intraracial violence, but they're generally more founded in personal relations as opposed to a race-based  you know, some other sort of animosity. the same sort of reasons that people have fights on the outside 
it's not an absolute policy, though. it isn't that if you haven't named him in the first administrative step, you can't name him in the complaint. that's not michigan's new policy.
 that decision.
so do we have different results in these two consolidated cases?
well, if the employee is required to investigate or report that kind of conduct pursuant to their normal duties of employment, then that is speech that the employer should absolutely or presumptively have an ability to monitor.
that's my hypothetical. my buttons, "hang musladin," is there any question about the risk of improper influence on my hypothetical? not this case, my hypothetical.
absolutely, your honor. my point was that, the point was that there was a collision, not who caused the collision, whether the deputy pulled into mr. harris' line of travel or mr. harris pulled towards the deputy.
that's correct. that's absolutely right.
clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just 
just give them the  just give them the money.
isn't that making the tail wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions on successive petitions that refers to teague, that you would read the teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when there's nothing in the language there that can be interpreted to refer to them?
well, in either case, it is referring to the 
well, the point is that the corporate law recognizes the two as separate and distinct corporate entities.
well, if they're twisting their back, you're not thinking they're going to stop questioning. i mean, what you're looking 
my example is 100 percent motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.
yes. i think you would look at a reasonable person in 
that's correct, your honor. and i would like to 
well, maybe. why isn't it permissible just to dismiss those parties who don't have the requisite jurisdictional amount? that's what i  where i stumble with this.
the defendant 
yes, he did. the  the  our answer 
yes, but not whole texts, not  i don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a) and (b), but this is not a word, age. it's  it's lines and lines, and to  and to say, oh, in griggs we held that the title vii language  this language means you can have a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read those very same words to prohibit. in one sense  one you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and then you read the same words to say these words prohibit 
they could have been any 
 let's talk about 
 wouldn't it be consistent with the screening mechanism that justice breyer suggested and  and that you accepted? wouldn't  wouldn't the  the  when the burden shifts, wouldn't the obligation be on  on the point of substance, as opposed to the point of  of screening, not to show that the  that the prosecutor would have brought the prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway? so you would have parallel standards.
we had to make up a rule to fill a gap.
that is if the union does not agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the flra. if 
yes, your honor, and, in fact, we've suggested that. in fact 
i think in general they stick to the evidence. they can argue that the nature and severity of the crime itself warrants the ultimate punishment and focus on  the focus of the penalty phase is supposed to be on the individual's moral culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty based on what they did. this argument, most of this argument i believe, as justice breyer suggested, it went on for pages and there was no mention really in any substance of william weaver and what he had done.
in fairness, justice scalia, i think that there are other respondents who claim to be property taxpayers in the city of toledo, aside from kim's auto.
you could have before this statute.
right.
should we overturn dr. miles and run that risk?
well, that may not be worth as much. maybe this includes several cities and towns? what do you think it is? i mean in other words, the answer to my question is in principle, yes. in principle, if the indian tribe owns 22 square miles, even if they can't get possession, they're entitled to the value of it, in your opinion?
as the case stands now, it is a monell claim, your honor. it is a pattern and practice claim.
as i  as i understood it.
well, i understand in 2005 congress doesn't necessarily express what was before, but it  it seems to me there's an institutional judgment that strawbridge is not that hallowed a  a principle.
but i want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.
but, of course, at the time they did that, the clayton act had already been passed.
that was the very point, leaving something on the porch where somebody can trip on it isn't unique to mail 
do we remand for those or what?
no. i'm not giving you that case. i'm giving you exactly what happened.
yes. but is there  this might be significant. is there in massachusetts, when a motion for acquittal is granted and there are other charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?
 of deliberation 
we've held it 
is it collecting that tax?
i entirely agree with you, judge  justice ginsburg, and i think that supports judge easterbrook's opinion. in the where will it be tried case, the lack of appellate review is less important because the merits of the case will go to state court and up through the system, and any federal issues can reach this case. in the slusa case, where the district court erroneously, as we know the district court erroneously did here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back to state court, that is a final determination of federal law that we submit is not reviewable in state court and can't be reviewed by this court up on review through the state system. so that 
what's that section you just alluded to? i'm blasting by it. where is it, in the 
that's right. and why probable cause is not the appropriate standard is because it does not distinguish between what might be an unconstitutional prosecution  that is, one based solely upon race, religion, or protected speech  and one that is not. when you look to these earlier cases, your honor, i agree they arose in employment contexts. they arose in the context of a prison.
but  but you would defend the warrant even if the only thing they were looking for was the stuff delivered at the  at the time.
all right. so that  that's  i recognize that it's been difficult for us to find an analog. it may be that batson is sui generis. it may not be. if we're going to talk about what judges are familiar with, then it's prima facie case and it's title vii.
oh, can you win.
 "can be used for" 
yes. i think it can occur in close cases. and, after all, those are the only cases where equipoise would even be relevant. and let me give you an example. suppose there's a woman who wants to donate a million dollars to yale law school, and, as part of that donation, she's going to  she has 
well  well, i'd like to ask  answer that in two ways. first, the  we would submit that a reweighing isn't necessary. this is not like vacating an aggravating factor. this is determining a constitutional error of due process. but let's assume for the moment that reweighing is  is adequate. there was no reweighing, proper reweighing, in either the appellate court or the ohio supreme court. the  the appellate court, which is the intermediate court in ohio, came out and said both wesley and stumpf were principal slayers as if they were both shooters. and the whole opinion is hinged on the assumption that mr. stumpf pled guilty to being the shooter. if you  i mean, that's  we submit that's just a fair reading of the opinion. and also, if you go to their main opinion, which is the final opinion, which this court reviews, the ohio supreme court  they did the same circular reasoning. ultimately they said he pled guilty. he was the shooter, and therefore, eastman's testimony will have little weight as hearsay to  to vacate the death sentence. they never independently weighed the case saying, let's take eastman as true, let's look at this case as an aider and abetter 
okay, but that  that is at least what  what's before us here, that if  if we go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude, in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could find. this jury did, but we'd have to find that that's reasonable. right?
sure.
well  i think, i think a school could certainly prohibit the display of banners on a school trip or in a school assembly.
and what's your response? (laughter.)
that's it. fine.
no, let's  i'm assuming the supreme court has said, this is what the statute means and so forth and so on, wouldn't that be binding on this?
but this last factor that i was about to get to, which i think provides a constraint that's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases, and that is the total deterrent effect of other punishment imposed in any remedial measures the official defendant has taken. now this can be presented first to the trial judge, saying okay, we have this huge award, but, you know, we have been fined by the government, we have had punitive damages assessed against us in other cases, and as a result we have taken the following measures which assure that we will not engage in this kind of misconduct again, and as a result also, this award should be cut.
it  it might be wrong anyway. (laughter.)
it wouldn't be identical but i agree with you, mr. chief justice, that a sentence within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a compelling case for a sentence outside the range because the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance. the sentencing commission itself recognized that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved out a heartland in the language of the sentencing commission's first set of guidelines, and that there will be circumstances that would justify different sentences.
as i read the court's opinion in brecht, the brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review. you would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.
but in  though of course, you'd have to confine it very narrowly, i take that doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into the rule. so there is a statute and you read the statute as saying well there could be very some very narrow circumstances that congress would have been willing to make an exception. for example it is a couple of days and the judge tells you, "do it" or lets you do it. it's roughly the same thing, isn't it?
i don't know the answer to that, your honor. i'm not aware of that, but 
well, how about the ones that were used on mr. deck during the trial? was that an alternative that was reasonable?
but we  we don't have to get into any of that if we accept your argument about 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.
if you don't require a clear statement, that's  that's good enough, it seems to me.
 that may be a reasonable inference, but i think it's a real stretch to say that it "clearly establishes." when you're talking about a statute, and you say something's "clear," you want to be able to point to actual words. and, on the other side, the government points out that, elsewhere in iirira, congress specifically delineates when it wants the statute to apply prospectively only. and they did not do that in this case.
is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? i  i want to know what the hypothetical is.
 you can take.
thank you, counsel. mr. shanmugam, we'll hear now from you.
if i  if i may interrupt you, i  your point, i take it, is, the jurors have got to make this decision, not the legislature of kansas.
excuse me 
mr. long, is it  is it fair to compare california to other states? the assumption would have to be that other states grant parole as liberally as california does. maybe california has made the decision, "we have too many people in prison. we're going to let a lot of them out, but we're going to keep them on a very tight leash." why shouldn't it be able to do that? to have tighter controls, but let out many more people on parole, which is  which is exactly what i think they're doing.
sometimes 
and what's been the result of that?
i'll stipulate to that.
your honor, if i  justice o'connor, if i can elaborate. it was raised in the district court, and in fact, i believe it's in the joint appendix. excuse me. it's in the cert petition at page 36a, which i think is appendix d, where the district court finds that they're permissible, and he cites weber and hale. and the district judge at that point made a final determination for the litigation in the district court that they were permissible and they were lawful in all circumstances. i did not  the matter on appeal to the ninth  the court of appeals on appeal, the more surer course that we thought for reversal would be the failure of particularity of these types of requirements. but the most important point is i do believe it's fairly included in the question presented before this court. several examples, long discussion, lots of confusion about what must  what procedure must take place with anticipatory warrants i think calls out for the inferior courts to hear from this court what those requirements are. to answer what those requirements are, this court must answer whether they're constitutional 
but the  what's being said may determine  may determine  whether or not entry is necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a prompt response is critical.
you're dividing it in half.
oh, you go 
yes.
even though this is a leasehold interest. i  i understand that.
well, your  were the two principal lesser-included offenses in  in your view your d-13 and d-18 that are in the appendix?
no, no, it wasn't in his petition, your honor, but it doesn't seem  the fact that he was looking back at his conviction, original conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down, doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was the judgment under which he was in custody, because it simply wasn't. the original 1994 judgment no longer existed because a new judgment had been entered. so because  and i don't think  i think what we disagree about in this is which judgment, if the first petition went to the first  to the 1994 judgment, and the second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would agree with mr. fisher that it is not successive. on the other hand, i believe i heard him say that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998 judgment. then he's filed a successive petition with regard to that judgment, one in december of 1998 dealing with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the sentence. so since it's a successive petition and mr. burton did not go through the gatekeeping function that aedpa requires, there is no  the district court official had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that this court does not have jurisdiction.
that is true. but in most cases, that is the only violation of supervised release for which they are later revoked. and, in that respect, it would be no different from a person who violates his probation by driving while intoxicated or committing some other legal violation.
exempt from state examination?
now, is that  suppose the prison locks down someone and says, "you can't go to the library."
well, but that's  that's linguistic. i'm  i'm looking for practical problems for prisoners, which was your initial argument. and in respect to a practical problem for a prisoner, i couldn't think of one, and that's why i'm asking. in respect to first habeases.
i do not believe there's anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because it's 
 in this case was a communication in the disposition memorandum. and that was  it was undisputed that that was purely pursuant to his prosecutorial duties 
is that what you mean by programming?
right.
but it is pending.
and do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right? you'd have a nice evening's work.
section 3 
now, suppose i  suppose i only pay the fee for eight of them. what happens?
no.
whether they want the protection or not?
but the document we received from the court just has  you know  the handwritten notation on it, file your appeal by 
he can bring, he can bring this, he could bring this not one action at a time, but he could complain all at once about everything?
can have you have a copyright on a program?
and taking section 3, it seems to me, we have the same problems.
correct.
there is more. what the  okay. what they did is when  is when the members decided that they wanted a new plan  this is after 6 months that they had been operating their joint venture without fixing the price. they then had a program that they submitted that they required equilon and motiva to follow. and this was their so-called strategic price plan.
the affidavit is not admissible.
i think what you have to do is you have to look at what the  the standards do. the  the registration standards in the ssrs are set up as the process by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into interstate trucking activities in michigan. when you look at the statute 
he's the  he's the  he is subject to cross examination.
 that you cite that case, in terms of justice scalia's remark, "watch what we do, not what we say." cleburne was a remarkable case in that respect. it purported to apply rational-basis review, but the plaintiffs won.
so you don't know. and  and in his brief, his argument was that we  that there was a stipulation to the $80,000.
two points, your honor 
right. but on the other hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause. you are saying rogers didn't change proximate cause.
well, i'm not here to 
this statute applied against people who defraud the united states government in taxes?
mr.  mr. srinivasan.
it is possible, but that's why the issue of the underlying district court's determination is not before you. the issue before you is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review that decision. but i would further point out, justice stevens, that the dabit court assiduously avoided the kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is whether or not negligence can be asserted against the securities defendants for failure to fair-value price. dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this court made clear. this is a negligence case, and there is a part of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what slusa is getting at are claims based on fraud. but even if you were to disagree that the  the district court had, you know, an alternate basis that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by the district court because it went off on the holder theory that this court rejected in dabit, you still wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as i have stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to review  appellate review of a remand order.
this is not a permanent segregation in these california prisons. it's just temporary, isn't it? how long does it last?
the ssrs.
 by your answer to justice  (laughter.)
what about attempted assault? i bet nobody has ever been hurt in an attempted assault.
that's correct, and that's why under 
no. it should fail if it fail  if it does not allege facts that indicate reasonable found 
 that's fine.
but the problem there is still the same. whatever it is that gave rise to the motion to dismiss as a sanction  the misconduct by counsel  you're still addressing that same problem. but a new trial addresses different issues than a judgment as a matter of law, and remittitur addresses different issues than a new trial.
because 
it's  it's a duty to advise him of  of his right to have them notify the  the consulate. it is not a duty to remain silent until the consulate responds. and even if you are correct that the obligation to  to advise him and to give the notice arises immediately upon the realization that he's a foreign national, i don't see anything in the treaty that requires them to defer interrogation until the  the consulate has decided whether it wants to do anything or not.
justice kennedy, as a matter of fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination here. we're having to fight this on the basis of assuming the  the allegations are true, but they are categorically false. and 
counsel, you've mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in the michigan grievance policy with respect to naming individuals. what is the consequence of that change for our ability to address that claim?
in the senate.
well, the trial judge also kept it out, didn't he, because he believed there was  there was no penal interest exception to the hearsay rule?
 first document 
oh, if you have that evidence?
go ahead.
and 
i disagree that that is a free ride, and i do not see that as a frustration of the 1-year statute of limitations when a petitioner has met the 1-year statute of limitations. your honor 
i disagree with you, justice scalia, for these reasons. first of all, the such transfer simply tells you what's not included. that language tells you  this is outside. it doesn't mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause. what congress was doing here, by making clear that these lands were not transferred 
now, my point was that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary to established law. and i would have thought that if it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to established law.
your honor has put his finger exactly upon the problem in this case, and that is that there was a tremendous question of liability. and as a matter of fact, this was a high nuisance value settlement, as lawyers refer to it.
shabani is a separate, distinct statute. 846 was a separate, distinct, discrete offense statute.
oh, he might  he might ultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one, the employee in connick lost. that's quite true. but at least 
what happened is that, that it 
yes.
 i 
well, the specific offenses are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects.
 requires a diminished-capacity defense?
there is not clear evidence in the record with respect to that  to that level of detail, but that 
there absolutely are texas procedures in which the question of the validity of the president's determination can be litigated. and we would anticipate that that would be litigated 
i'm sure it does.
i don't know that there are any other instances in which that's true, justice ginsburg, but i don't think it's a constitutional problem. i think at the end of the day the question is, does congress have the power to enforce its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter of policy at the pleadings stage, and i think the answer to that question is yes. but again, you don't have to 
that's true.
thank you, mr. fisher. mr. dreeben, you have 2 minutes remaining.
why isn't he? if  if  what he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, i want you to do it right in the future.
justice kennedy, i agree that you have to distinguish two things rightly. the first is the state of the law as it exists now, and that's what we ask you to affirm. and that is, the federal circuit has made quite clear that its test is inclusive, and we think that that establishes that it's not necessary to add some new sort of undetermined test of 
 would have to show that, in fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent.
yes. they are filled with factual information that in their opinion shows that previously the democrats had gerrymandered this much worse, and that what  this was an effort to create a balance. that's what their view is. now, i want to know really precisely what is your response to that argument.
three answers. number one, under the patent laws, everybody  anybody who makes, uses or sells the invention is potentially liable as an infringer. number two, congress knows this and it knows that the people who might be liable as infringers are doctors. it passed in 1996 section 287(c) of the patent law that gives doctors a defense to infringement for certain things they do in their offices, not this one. so congress is perfectly aware of all of the policy issues being raised and has chosen to give an answer only so far. the third is it is a fundamental misconception to treat the case as though, even if the section 101 issue is in front of the court  and it isn't  whether the issue is whether section 101 means that something is actually patentable as opposed to what diehr said, which is, is it possibly patentable. this is subject matter patentability. is the mouth of the funnel, not the end of the funnel, and all of the outlandish hypotheticals that we have to deal about how this could be patented don't really deal with the reality of the patent code, which is this is the intake funnel. we have doctrines of obviousness, anticipation, 112, many other things, all of which were raised at trial and the jury rejected in this case. but the reason why there may be some superficial appeal to the outlandish hypotheticals, justice breyer, is because there is an effort to confuse the issue that they're trying to smuggle belatedly into the case, 101, as though it dealt with whether something is actually patentable as opposed to potentially patentable. and on the latter question, whether something is potentially patentable, we have the extremely broad language of section 101 coupled by this court's cases, in chakrabarty and diehr, which said that what congress intended is for anything under the sun made by man to be potentially patentable. and if there is some more precise policy issue why a particular invention ought not to be patentable, it is found in section 102, 103, 112, other parts of the patent code, on which they lost in front of the jury.
does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?
this  this kind of peculiarity happens all the time.
i don't think the system needs to be tinkered with, your honor.
when  the immediate danger was 
i say  excuse me, your honor. i say that that is a fiction because what it attaches to is the cause of action that existed instantly at the time of the injury, and so say, no, you don't own that because it was assigned to us. well, we had to have something to assign, otherwise assignment was meaningless. we  in  in summation, as i see the white light is on, we believe that this case  and it is respondent's position that these three statutes that we have been discussing here are plain and unambiguous and that the case should be resolved upon the basis of the statutory language. and we  it is further respondent's position that if the case is resolved on the basis of the statutory language, the eighth circuit reached a very correct analysis of the language and the results that that takes place. there is no ambiguity, and under the first step of the chevron case, we submit to the court that this is a case of statutory construction within the terms of the statutes which, read together, are unambiguous and plain. they get an assignment for the claim for medical care services. the anti-lien statute shields the rest. thank you very much.
that's all it takes for the new york state supreme court, for example, to have said, well, you know, our  our wire-tap statute does the same thing as the fourth amendment does anyway? that's all it takes?
yes.
well, at the  at the district court level, the  the district court heard a rule 59. but one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that saucier v. katz came out, and in the ninth circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. this was june 2001 actually. and so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. the district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that ms. mena had been kept after the end of the search. the district judge found that. and then in  in the ninth circuit, of course, the ninth circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. and basically the  the qualified immunity  on the  on the over-detention claim, i think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for  i mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. i mean, that  this court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a  on a terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. here, there's nothing to hold her. with respect to the handcuffing issue 
but the reason 
until  until they  they have assurance that  that the individuals are  are not members of a gang and likely to, in  in their view, commit racial violence if  if co-celled with another prisoner.
 to your client?
there is not. the same  the record of constitutional violations is nationwide. we don't have any judicial findings 
yes.
it  it  the phrase, because of age, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that separates the two.
and we don't have any transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like that?
what's the second reason?
yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury  and it's right there on the special interrogatories  one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion. that was there. and i have a question about your characterization of what the seventh circuit did. it was puzzled. it says, "extortion, they all go." but here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the court on those. was the court supposed to assume that the court made a question  decided a question of statutory interpretation by silence?
i think in looking at the rule again derived from williams and flynn, we don't have to go there. it's the risk, not the reality. i don't know what could be inferred, and we don't know what was in the jurors' minds as they saw those buttons. but the point is that it could affect the outcome. it is an impermissible factor that causes the possibility that the jurors' verdict is based on something other than the evidence.
 and with your reliance on the trial court's findings. i do not see how the fact that he's  he's there in the cell in his underwear, the fact that he's 17, the fact that he thinks, and has been led to believe, erroneously, that there's a death penalty in the offing, has anything to do with the question that edwards asks, which is whether the police, or this individual, initiated the conversation.
 absolutely.
right. sort of, you know, reasonably reliant, is it fair.
well 
 there are a lot of limitations that the california court 
it wasn't 
 congress spoke 
but  but the  the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a  is a higher level of generality than anything that balisok decided. in balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and  and that is a much more specific  i mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released. it is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.
but it's a  it's  what michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal. and so virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition. west virginia has a first-tier by petition and 
 had 
well, that's true, but  so, you said it's conceded in this case? i thought, in answer to justice kennedy, you said something that  i was surprised, if it's conceded. i thought it wasn't conceded  tell me if i'm wrong  that the states have water quality standards. those water quality standards may or may not have something to do with point source discharges. they don't have to. they want water to be good enough for recreation. they want water without algae so there are more fish. they have a lot of things. and this statute seems to say the f  what used to be the fpc. i  is it now ferc?
aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be  is that  i apologize for my voice  the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence? the guidelines, in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). the rest of them say individualized sentencing. the guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the guidelines. therefore, in order to  to break this, in effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, i think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally, he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing, but that's as much as he can be required to do. is that a fair statement of your position?
one of the nice things about rule 60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a court examining its own mistakes. it isn't a wide-open door in any respect. it is a disciplined approach. there are six specific grounds, and even though the sixth one looks like it's wide-open, it certainly isn't under the jurisprudence of the court. and so what this does is provide a very important opportunity for a judge to be able to look at an intervening decision from the supreme court of the united states and say, i have denied this person what congress wanted them to have. there's no question. one reads aedpa and one thing is very clear. they  congress intended for a person who has exhausted claims, not procedurally defaulted them in state court, and has filed a timely petition, that person under 2254 is entitled to have the claim entertained. and when a court makes a mistake, a procedural mistake, that forgoes or eliminates the opportunity for review, and that's barely reviewable on appeal, depending on how the certificate of appealability may be phrased  and often these folks are pro se  i think what happens is 2254 has failed and what congress intended to happen isn't going to happen. the person was entitled to one petition, one bite at the apple and never receives that bite at the apple.
thank you so much, your honor. i think  i think that if the statutory text was clear, which  and i believe this text is clear in the other direction  i think we would lose that case. but that is not this case, your honor, and let me explain why.
if the government tries to pursue these policies solely by private inducement, trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, another state, what-not. by taking on the job itself, the government in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation of service? there's kind of an assurance of service plus the objectives that the government gets by running the plant itself. and isn't that sort of the nub of all of your points?
i don't. and that  that case has not come before this court yet, and so i don't know how this court would decide that case if it comes. i know some of the federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea. one thing the michigan statute is  does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation. it's  it's the baseline.
what is there different about your proceeding to treat this as a rico enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate criminal conspiracy law? what does rico add here?
well, that was true in casey.
in a particular place, yes, that's correct. justice scalia, the reason these federal circuit judges were right notwithstanding your correct point which is, just to be clear, our invention is not limited to asano. our invention takes any fixed pivot adjustable pedal and any electronic throttle control and says combine it in a particular way. the federal circuit's point is their motion rests on asano. the other side's theory is, we've got this invention, engelgau. as has been pointed out, nobody did anything like this for 10 years. the other side comes back and says yes, that it would have been obvious to somebody who had an asano to do the same thing basically. and so the federal circuit said okay, show us. if this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just give you the invention and you just say oh, i could have done that, they say give us any evidence that someone would have done what you say, which is take asano, it's their argument, asano 
if these are, as i understand your honor's hypothetical, three independent searches  -
i'm talking about the daughter's testimony.
two reasons, justice scalia. the first is the one that i gave, and that is, the steiner court concluded that  and that was the end of the sentence, where it said, "except as excluded by 4(a)(1)," that congress made clear in 4(a)(1)  that the initial walk wouldn't be the first principal activity. second, the walk won't be integral and indispensable. the test for whether or not something is integral and indispensable is whether it's work that's required and closely related to the productive activities. and simply walking to the donning station is not. that's in contradistinction to putting on the clothes that are required here, required as a matter of law in order to do your job. that's the line that the statute draws.
no. i've given you the straight facts. the straight facts are they sue  i don't have to repeat them. i want to know under  under my straight facts, wouldn't you say that  you got the question.
your honor, if i could respond, the delay issue is not the crux of the problem. the crux of the problem is that the police officers here never told ms. gonzales that they believed that there was or was not probable cause.
i believe they can.
i have no double about that. i mean, if you're going to ask anybody, you know, do you prefer integrated schools or would you prefer lily-white schools, nobody is going to say give me a lily-white school. of course nobody's going to say that. i was asking whether the parents whose kids can't go to the schools they want to go to, including the neighborhood schools, do they like this particular system of achieving the racial diversity? is there any testimony about that?
 that way. but the other thing that i wanted to say about your question about profitt is that florida, like some of the other states, after maynard v. cartwright declared that "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" was an inappropriate eligibility circumstance under the eighth amendment, some states have fashioned either instructions or changes in their law to tailor their "heinous circumstance" to meet the concerns that are expressed in profitt. but california has never done that, because 
maybe they said that. i'd be surprised if they said that.
well, there is no evidence on that question presented, right? the reason that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be considered is because neither party had put evidence on that question before the jury.
i just have to read craig 
you don't want to 
 defendants.
no, your 
but the whole point is these are not unique. the whole point is there are private companies that provide these kinds of services. maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are not unique. but you can't say that this is a unique service being provided by government.
thank you, counsel. mr. frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 why is it so dramatic, if we recognize that nothing begins until the donning and doffing  that is, the travel to wherever you don and doff?
you do not have a privacy interest in contraband, as this court has recognized in the jacobsen case.
yes, your honor, and at page 5 of our brief, we pointed that out. there were two parts to it. under the agreement  and if you'll look at page 5 of our brief, we have both of the agreements. and under those agreements  under those agreements, it was necessary that the  i'm sorry. at page 7. under those agreements, if the court will look at it, first of all, it says, the company's business shall be conducted by the ceo and other officers of the company, subject to the direction by, and in accordance with the policies, business plans, and budgets approved by shell and texaco  they said the members  acting by and through the members committee. that's shell and texaco. but more importantly 
but unless there is a way to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no clear way to distinguish the presumption from the mandate. the mandate is gone. you say yes, they consider other things. but unless we can calibrate the presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in practice.
well, that's true, justice souter. i mean, i think if you look at brown against board of education itself and you look at the various per curiam opinions that this court issued in the wake of brown v. board, i don't think any of those decisions have a hallmark of being elaborate about the standard of review that the court has applied. nonetheless 
all right. do you  do you think it's  it's reasonable to say that if the police take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open, that there is  there is no compromise of a privacy interest?
and it seems  it seems mean to punish the state for going the extra mile and sending the notice by registered mail because that informed them that it didn't reach him.
so you disagree with that?
and of course, it refers to more than one state because it referred to even more than one national bank association. it's a plural associations, and then it says, each of them shall be deemed a citizen of the state in which  it says in the plural  in which they are respectively located.
have some states purported to adopt a general rule on this?
justice o'connor, it stands for  the test is whether or not there are commercially significant noninfringing uses. the ninth circuit got it wrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a combination of two things: being able to point out that there were such things as public-domain works or authorized sharing of the wilco album, for example, and anecdotal evidence that you could actually do that. now, if that were the right reading of sony, with respect, i would suggest that footnote 23 of this court's sony decision would have been the sum total of the court's analysis, because in that footnote the court observed that there were broadcasts of public-domain works.
yes, that's right, your honor. also two points, though. we asked for any other relief that is just and proper and we had other claims that could not be solved by a more narrow  by more narrow relief, we claimed that the act's judicial bypass doesn't  isn't sufficient under this court's case  this court's decision in bellotti ii, it doesn't provide for confidentiality and then there is no way to remedy that without facial invalidation.
okay. justice stevens? do you have any case on that?
yes.
i think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway.
what does it depend on?
and i say this would be the first.
 reasonable expectations, i suppose, here.
a lot of things.
i don't understand the difference. i mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of. now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one. it may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here. it seems to me that whether it violates the establishment clause depends upon whether you're endorsing  whether you're proselytizing religion.
no, but that  that was  that was an ex post remedy and there were no identifiable funds. what we're talking about here is an ex ante injunction and the funds are identifiable. and you are telling me that, in fact, all the  all the equity court could have said was, don't pay yourself?
 basis for the 
well, they could  they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the  with the deciding judge.
thank you, general. mr. hopper, you have 4 minutes remaining.
correct.
in our position no issue should be precluded because under california law, which the ninth circuit was obligated to apply, only identical issues that are resolved under a different set of laws can be precluded in the second proceeding, and there was no identical issue finding by the ninth circuit. instead, the ninth circuit applied its equivalent determination finding. but i think that the  the real issue before this court is not the california preclusion law question, but the real issue is whether this court's decision in england should  or the rationale of this court's decision in england should be applied to the very similar circumstances raised by 
i don't think a trial is necessary because, as i say, this  this court quoted justice frankfurter clearly, and i think the solicitor general in his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is not going to get as much benefit from this fee. this is a variable cost fee. in effect, the out-of-state carrier is having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the  of the state's regulatory system. and again, that's something that was accepted in the scheiner case, accepted in  in the nippert case. and the intrastate carrier  every time that it operates in the state, it is using that privilege.
yes.
well, isn't that an incongruity that congress would say you have your choice? complainant, you can go to the federal agency, the fcc, or you can go to court.
well, you don't have that in this case, do you, because i thought the, i thought one of the arguments on the other side was the inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?
but we've never held that? we've never held that consecutive  that the treatment of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by blakely?
that's correct, your honor, and  and we would  we would simply urge the court not to adopt a categorical rule that it's inappropriate to look at the state's case.
why isn't  why isn't that part of the tribal sovereign right?
 that that's 
 out of  and if the box  but your injury arises  if it's to or from the mail 
 that are in addition to or different.
but what we are involved with in this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that aggravate, and these do require findings.
but that was the whole basis  correct me if i'm wrong  for the ninth circuit's case in your  ninth circuit decision in your favor in this case. in this case, it certainly 
yes, but  but it is true you have a strong textual 
your honor, i'm not certain of the answer, except that i do know that the government did argue that simply  the mere idea that david duncan testified that, you know, he thought that the  somebody at the sec might want to look at this information someday was sufficient to satisfy the instructions. and so, i think it is a fair inference that the way that they argued this case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind of information away from the sec was enough to satisfy the definition in this case. and, in fact, your honor, when the instructions were being debated, the pattern instruction for the fifth circuit for "corruptly," under 1503, actually is  includes the words "knowingly or dishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding." the government insisted that the word "dishonestly" not be used, that the word "impede" be added, and they changed "fact-finding" a bit  changed it from "subverting the proceedings" to "the fact-finding ability." they did everything they could to strip this instruction of any mens rea, and then went beyond that and said, "and in addition, even if the andersen employees had a good-faith and sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the law, it's still a crime." so, what we have here is an array of testimony from people who say, "we honestly believed that this was permissible conduct," but the jury was told that they had to convict anyway if there was any possible partial motivation to impede possible future fact-finding 
yes.
the second one, does it raise some reasonable possibility of innocence. in other words, if you believe this evidence 
oh, no. that's 
yes, with the caveat that we're assuming that the hypothetical is that the state court has misapplied, that the fair import has  they have misapplied the holdings of this court.
and the same answer for 1981?
they brought their case for liability in the federal forum. they were forced by you into the delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that exxon pushed. you brought the case in delaware. they didn't.
well, didn't they do that? didn't they do that in the patent misuse reform act?
on your reading, i just don't see that there's any function. i mean, if disparate impact is out of it, then  then what work is there for the reasonable factor other than age to do?
correct.
well, it's four or five cases that jackson transit was built on, for instance, the machinists case v. central airlines, which came out of the 1960's. in those cases, for instance, they  the principle is simple and it's a strong one, and that is that congress assumes that a  when it calls for the creation of a  a contract in a statute, that it will be enforceable just as with ordinary contracts.
may i ask one other question then too?
no, i do not make that, i do not make that broad argument, your honor. i think in the special circumstances of state habeas, where, as this court knows, 99 percent of cases are on their way to federal habeas, and the state does not adopt this procedural impediment which would from a judicial 
because that does not describe the tax that's at issue here. the tax at issue here is imposed on the sale or delivery of fuel to the tribe on the reservation, and that is plain 
"out of which the claim arose" it seems to me is of some importance. but the official dissenting judges in the first circuit case, wood, didn't think it was important. i'm not sure they were right about that.
so, it went to diminished mental capacity. and as i understand arizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only be presented in the context of an insanity defense.
your honor, to my knowledge, the  the irs has had a consistent position that the entire amount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that may be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement, even in the condemnation context, is tax  is included in the gross income of  of the taxpayer. and i would point your honor to the case out of the federal circuit, baylin v. united states. that case involved a condemnation action, and the court of appeals in that case addressed the issue that's presented in these cases and concluded that it was includable in gross income.
i'm sorry, your honor. yes. this  artuz said that a time limit without exception, say, in 30 days you must file in 30 days, no exception, or in 1 year, no exceptions  that's what artuz called a condition to filing and that you're either in or you're out in that rule. and artuz, though, reserved the question presented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, like the pcra time bar  whether that could be properly filed. and so obviously, artuz reserved the exact question here. but what  the analysis of artuz controls here and shows that this petition was properly filed.
well, i  i think it does modify the verb, but 
i would submit to the court that 8 that argument indicates to a reasonable jury future 9 dangerousness as much as the argument in simmons itself 
well, in nelson, it was important, and we would submit that it was really the dispositive factor in the court's analysis. the court noted the fact that the state had conceded  the prisoner had identified and the state had conceded that an alternative method could be used to administer the execution.
in this case, if mr. haley had said, i had some conversations with the private employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during the conversations, but i never told them to discharge her, would this, would that be something  would your argument apply there?
 that was true of united foods.
but couldn't you make every failure to warn claim a defective design claim? that is, they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects would not have been present if the product had been designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse effect on the peanut crop.
mr. farr, you have three minutes remaining.
suppose others cooperate? suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol might be a good idea, and before you know it, they decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an impact, and lo and behold, cape cod is saved. now why is it unreasonable? why is it unreasonable to go to an agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, and now we're going to go to a different agency like nhtsa and we're going to ask them too, and we're going to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal. and there are like not a million things that have to be done, maybe there are only seven. but by the time we get those seven things done, we'll make a big difference. now what is it in the law that says that somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want you to do your part? would you be up here saying the same thing if we're trying to regulate child pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a computer can get pornography elsewhere? i don't think so.
would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate? the court of appeals for the federal circuit decision went one way and the tenth circuit went another. and are the claims at all overlapping? how are they differentiated?
mr. dreeben, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 maybe all we have to do is deal with whether that court should have addressed the evidence.
thank you, mr. reichman. the case is submitted.
do  do i understand that you would be satisfied if the court simply looked to  what is it  7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the tax court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions? and that 
yes, and the reason is that that's what congress chose to do. i mean, in the prospective 1996 act, it 
yes, your honor. i  i suppose that would be the effect of how it would have to be read but it's not a question of one federal interest is less than another. anytime federal law is involved, the federal interest is great. the issue is for arising-under purposes, for section 1331 purposes, whether the federal question is substantial or not sufficiently substantial to confer arising-under jurisdiction. that's the import in our argument and our submission, the holding of merrell dow.
 an exception that applies only to one context, and that's administrative offsets. and that certainly raises a very strong inference that, where there isn't such an exception, the statute applies to administrative proceedings, more generally.
well, i'll have to leave that for the respondents to address for you. but what  what the court below pointed to was conversations that took place in the spring of 1998 about a strategic marketing initiative. and this is after the formation of equilon, after equilon was operational. and at that point, all you conceivably have at that point with the owners of equilon having left the market is equilon subject to the direction of its owners setting the prices for its products, and it could sell them as shell gasoline, it could sell them as texaco gasoline, it could choose to sell them as something else.
yes, your honor. and that's most clear, from the dissent, as characterizing the question that the court is addressing. and the oregon supreme court opinion is in the  excuse me  the appendix to the cert petition. and at page 68 of the appendix from the dissent, justice gillette writes, "the issue in this case is whether under the emphasized wording of that statutorily required jury instruction," referring to the mitigation question, "defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the evidence that he proffered. the majority says he was. i disagree."
it  what the statute specifically says  this is section 3409  it says that the distributor may pass on  "may"  it's a permissive provision  may pass on the cost of the taxation as a part of the cost of doing business. and, of course, the distributor does that with respect to the cost of its vehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays. it may include those provisions.
and i also agree with justice scalia, that social expectation may be, in part, measured by our cases on this subject. and i just don't see how, if it's against the interest of an occupant to allow entry, that that  that that interest must, necessarily, be overridden.
 i have to interrupt. they did not overlook that he had been given the miranda warning. she expressly commented on the fact that an hour and 17 minutes had lapsed since that time.
no, we don't  we don't think that's the exclusive focus either, and we think interrogation can capture both, too, that when you get to the point of interrogation, what's happening with the witness is getting an increasing understanding that what this is being sought for is to build a case. i think the biggest problem with the  the two rules that are proposed on the other side, that is, the accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation rule, is it captures within a  these emergency statements that really don't have  fall within any ordinary understanding of what testimony is. if i go to my house and it's late at night, i hear suspicious noises, and i see somebody and get a partial description of him, and i call 911, i'm seeking to avert an immediate danger to myself. i don't think under any stretch of the imagination anybody would refer to that as testimony. yet, under his rule 
i thought you said that maybe cavity searches would not  would not be allowed without some special reason for them. and that wouldn't necessarily be harassment.
what's the authority for the burden of proof question? what  what  which of our cases do you rely on for that?
 circumstance.
why couldn't there be here? i mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly  no, let me not exaggerate. but they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. for obvious reasons. now, at some point, if enough judges say that, each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that inherent risk that it's unconstitutional. but if some point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional?
did we make the argument in williams?
oh, i  that's how i understood it.
well, it's conceivable, i guess, that people will break their parole. often it doesn't happen; sometimes it does. sometimes they want to get him back; sometimes they don't.
 the state say when it comes to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you something. we think, indeed, that's what we argued, that the state  in the last case we argued that stumpf didn't pull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against that, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death. that would make your position absolutely consistent with what you argued in that second trial with mr. 
and  and that's in effect what you're arguing.
compensation, of course, has to be paid.
 a cavity search 
you may  you may say that there's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change.
they are. the florida supreme court specifically says you must have these colloquies to determine consent.
no, but we usually don't use 
the nonintercourse act
and what is the best example of that?
that related only to the 5,000 acres that they occupied at that time. the record isn't very clear about why he made that assurance.
yes.
 he has to and wait 
i  i don't think that that is a fair reading of the epa decisional document, your honor. certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way to say, "and reading these considerations together and not any of them individually." and with respect to the scientific uncertainty, your honor, you also have to take into account that the epa had before it and pointed to the report of the national research council on global climate change.
it's the  it would be the same result whether the employer puts a time on it or not. the employer says  i'll give you an example we could agree on, when it's a time 
well, i think the answer is that they don't have the same problems that california has. california has the most prison gangs, the  they are race-based. it's an extraordinarily difficult situation. and even the bureau of prisons takes race into account when it balances its prisons and that's in the united states' brief.
it's not what we'd optimally want the court to do, but that's not the inquiry that's presented and answered by boyde. the question is as a result of what happened. trials are not error-free. we wish that they were, but they're not. the question is how do you respond to when a  when a prosecutor makes a misstatement of law. and boyde addresses that question. boyde 
i mean, if you put your mind to it, you can make one up, which is sort of the test for rational basis in the economic context. but as soon as we become more realistic, there isn't much of a reason. it can't satisfy the stronger test, though it could satisfy the weaker.
that's right.
yes.
to tie something to the great machine.
justice ginsburg, in the simopoulos case considered by this court, one of the issues that was raised was a medical  the physician was prosecuted for performing an abortion outside the parameters of the virginia act. and the physician failed to raise a medical necessity defense. this court held that that was sufficient prosecution, that that was okay. and this would work the same way. once the physician raises a competing harms defense 
are they 
or if that happened a large percentage of the time. i mean, surely you'd concede that the search is unreasonable if, for every  every one time, you  you make somebody open his bag because the dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody open his bag because he has apples in it. i mean, wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of 
no. it's quite unlike the situation, for example in timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. there is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.
oh, indeed. the scow is  is what they put the fill in, and as differentiated from a barge, a scow has the ability to open up its bottom to let all the fill out when they get out to sea.
right. and it would depend a little bit on about where the president is getting the money. i think the way that we would look at it 
well, yes, that's true. but, you know, the court reached out to the apa for guidance in construing the labor laws. the labor laws were silent on this issue, but under the apa, the court said the general policy is to disclose these reports and we are going to say that that is applicable to the nlrb. now, the government says all of this changes the course because the judge changed his mind, but you know, there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an opinion is suppressed or  or vacated or replaced and that first opinion is still part of the record. it's a fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because it's been abandoned. for example, if i seek summary judgment in the district court and it's denied and then i ask for reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been abandoned, but it's still part of the record. and if i  if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit a in any appeal, and it may result in a reversal. same thing when a case goes en banc. the panel opinion is vacated, but then when  when cert is granted, the argument before this court may convince this court that the panel was right. even though it's been abandoned, it's still very important. or if a jury verdict is set aside  the  the district court says, judgment as a matter of law  on appeal, the jury  jury verdict may get sustained. so it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody has changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that  that the first report drops out of the record.
all right.
a demurrer is decided on the pleadings, isn't it?
i think it's even more complicated than that, justice breyer, because in fact, you're right that the d&x patients were at a further gestational age, but the d&e patients were actually older. and so i think 
who put in the evidence  who put in the semen evidence?
we would have 
it would be my position. i would have thought, as the prosecutor thought here, that a probable cause finding that guns are in the house, based not on any specific knowledge about guns, but based on experience in similar circumstances, was not sufficient to satisfy richards in terms of not knocking. i would certainly make the argument that it ought to be, but i would have not criticized the prosecutor, who didn't make that argument.
well, the master's methodology really wasn't at issue.
well, anybody who wants the additional time  this law was passed to prevent people from delaying. but anybody who wanted to delay would then have to file a cert petition, i assume?
there is  there's an overarching concern and i'll  i'd like to put it to you right from the beginning. when a legislature legislates, be it the state or federal government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick. when congress legislates, it's thinking about the united states. sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of the time when it is, it says so. and we have a number of cases, not just the arabian american oil company. i mean, that  the language of title vii was between a state and anyplace outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. and in that very case, the chief made the point that i'm putting to you now, that congress thinks about the united states, our country, and if it means to say something that will take in other places in the world, it says so clearly. and we don't make the assumption that congress was intending to have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells us that. that's my overall concern about the government's position in this case.
the dissenting judge did not  the dissenting judge, judge newman, did not read the court's opinion the way you do. is that correct?
but that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. now, justice ginsburg 
your honor, the state  the federal government is able to count those, but the evidence is that they don't. and that goes back to a question, i believe, justice souter asked. in the michigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory, "what enforcement by  is done of in-state wineries." in that regard, the answer was, "none."
yes, your honor.
no, we don't think that at all. as this court 
what else did 
well, but i  a moment ago, you said, "okay, we'll assume that there would be some derogation," in justice breyer's example. i don't see why you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the restitution aspect here.
thank you, mr. freedman. mr. cole, you have 3 minutes remaining.
you don't care what standard 
thank you, counsel.
right, because the prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information from other people.
yeah, it logically gives rise to taxpayer standing. so  and i think there is 
yes, your honor.
if that were true, and if as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's only three percent of them actually involve risk to  of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent. i would think that. would that satisfy the characteristic requirement?
yes, your honor. but the  but the tax court has determined not to disclose it.
 including a governmental inquiry.
i thought in granberry the court gave the court of appeals that discretion, since it hadn't  the point had been missed in the district court, been missed by everybody, until the court of appeals.
okay.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
okay. but you're  you're assuming  your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.
your honor 
if in this case, the indictment had charged  had claimed that the defendant was the father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a position of trust?
could they fine him for not  could they fine him for not  for not keeping them advised of  of where  where his tax address is?
maybe.
well, is your view  on your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence only if it is shown to be unreasonable?
but it seems to me that would happen if there's an autonomous, structural right of the kind you  you urge.
wouldn't it be the same result if congress decided, for example, to take away one of the available methods of seeking discretionary review, just saying, "we're not going to have that available anymore"?
 says 
no. i  i think that what you would look to see is if, at the relevant time, that  that the declarant was acting as a witness. and at the relevant time, when somebody is answering a question to avert an immediate danger, they're not acting as a witness. they're not making a solemn declaration for the purpose of proving facts to support a prosecution, and so they're not acting as a witness in those circumstances. and  and it's only later, when the officer turns to soliciting from ms. hammon an affidavit, that what he's soliciting at that point is a solemn declaration made for the purpose of proving facts to support a prosecution. now, that's testimony.
they make a kind of interesting argument, major modification is not a subset of modification.
but that's a defense. and you're talking about, yes, you might draw that inference but that inference would be wrong because i have a defense. the defense is poor performance explains it, not sex discrimination.
yes, it would. so it would not necessarily apply to the non-taylor provisions such as the one 
well, in a case like this, the county never came forward 
well, then, what is your 
well 
that's correct. i think that the second circuit got this issue correct in the santini case when it concluded that whether you started in federal court and were ordered to proceed to state court under williamson county or you looked at the williamson county case and said, i'm going to start in state court because that's what williamson county says that i'm required to do, it doesn't matter. it shouldn't matter for purposes of issue preclusion on the federal takings claim once it has been made ripe under the procedures required by williamson county.
 it would have to be punishable under the controlled substances 
 i'm sorry.
it is fungible in 
so if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis? 3:00 in the morning, loud shouting. can they conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis?
that's correct.
correct. according to their version, they're taking 
that's a question this court hasn't decided, and i don't have a position on that. but that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.
 those particular provisos.
mr. garre.
mr. srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.
if you look at 50(a), your honor, it specifically says that the 50(a) motion can be granted. now, that would be inconsistent with a view of the rule that says that the only remedies available are set forth in section (b) and triggered by the renewal of the motion.
 what seems to me to be involved here is what is not uncommon in our federal system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the same or closely related subject matter. it is not infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in federal court and state court, and then the one that gets finished first  that judgment is binding on the other. and as i understand it, the probate proceeding concluded first before the district judge reviewed the bankruptcy judge's opinion.
yes, sir. you're correct. first, we wouldn't have  have charged 
are you 
well, but part of the statute is sherbert and verner and the test that congress says we have to apply to its acts here.
with real property, if the owner has not been notified by mail, absolutely i think they should post notice on the property. that is a traditional way 
the  they made no discussion of the reason for taking out the language, of the united states or of any state, and what they  the only language was that we're intending to merge these into one statute 
well, i'm not sure i agree 14 with your argument, but i suppose one answer to justice 15 souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that 16 you would always get at least 1 year. if the  if the 17 state conviction was 10 years prior to the federal 18 conviction and he waited and did nothing, i take it, he 19 still has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two 20 provisions.
let me rephrase that, justice scalia. the question is, given the tennessee jury instruction 
can i back you up just a bit before we talk about piggybacking? this court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have standing in this sort of situation, have they?
i think in  in alaska, of course, right now there is a party option where all the parties but the republicans have opened the primary. they have a blanket primary. the republicans haven't and the republicans, of course, in alaska happen to be the dominant party. there seems to be a pattern in these cases 
 where was that  where was that maintained? because i thought that below, all there were was this was a  was it a lesser-included offense under state law, and i didn't see below any reference to the federal constitution.
i think that what's important is the very beginning of your question. you said that we said in state court that it violated the fifth amendment.
thank you, mr. long. mr. srinivasan.
that's a pretty broad definition of a sham.
 the constitutional violation is the violation of the supremacy clause.
i think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they  they knew that at 8:45, at the time that officer muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and  and everything was done, that mr. romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. and at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, iris mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.
okay.
then we take it as valid. then we take it as valid. that's not a claim you're challenging. but i take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.
that's true.
but none of this  none of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it? i mean, they didn't care where the incidence was. they just went right into the balancing, right?
well, my  i'm sorry.
 we have a choice, a fork in the road. take it. all right.
well, they don't sound like synonyms. so i'm asking you what you would recommend that this court do. if you say that the standard is the same as rational basis, perhaps this confusing phrase should be eliminated.
how do they do it with my leaky bathroom?
you have given a few examples of a word may mean different things in different contexts, but you haven't given any example  and i don't know that there is one  where the entire string of words is identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the other. i mean, you have a much harder argument to make when you're talking about an entire provision where the wording is almost identical than when you're talking about one word used in different contexts.
but that's 
and "such" would refer just to the previous usage of that precise term, which is disregard local education agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues. so it's that "with per-pupil revenues" that the "such" would refer back to, the most immediate prior reference, so we're still looking at per-pupil revenues or expenditures in the state which we have to rank first. we don't identify leas first. it doesn't say 95th percentile of leas. it tells us rank per-pupil revenue. the only difference 
really? suppose we walk into a department store. in the department store, we see three perfume counters, and there are three salesmen, one behind each. do they compete in price? the answer is obvious. of course, not. of course 
okay. now, in (b), i guess it's saying that if the 14 state happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought 15 his negligent suit against him, he can respond.
not necessarily. i mean, there  but we do submit that the timing issue that we just raised, about them having full information, would certainly be something we'd argue to the district court in its discretion. but another thing you have to consider, to your point, is that limitations is something that's  that has a subtle meaning and derive  and is directly addressed by civil rules 8 and 12. and this court, in gonzalez and mayle, says that when that happens, that's where you start, with the civil rules. and then you ask if there's anything in the habeas statutes or rules that's inconsistent with that approach, with the  with the forfeiture approach of the civil rules.
what  what about this as a general  as a general principle of construction? a court should not, unless there is no reasonable alternative, construe a statute of limitations provision in such fashion that the statute can expire before the cause of action arises?
whether he gets the 
well 
well, your honor, i think that my answer would have to be that in relation to the hypothetical given, i was answering it because  with regards to the circumstances of the community that the defendant committed the crime in. if we take that away 
you  you did draft this injunction. it wasn't the  an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. is that so?
did the u.s. attorney in this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?
had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.
he's been found guilty and sentenced to prison.
 what is the right that that reporter has that's specific to courthouses?
you can only recover if that inflation is taken out of the stock. those are recoverable damages under ninth circuit law.
yes. and you're having the judge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't make certain demonstrations. if the family were there and they  and one of the members of the family was sobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, i  that 
 in the federal government?
the prosecution told counsel i'm 18 going to use these files as part of my case and eventually 19 use them for aggravation purposes.
mr. englert 
mr. layton, you have 8 minutes remaining.
 had jurisdiction to 
i wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end.
yes, it  we assume that, because, in this case, the california supreme court held that to be invalid. in profitt  and that's florida statute 
well, except that, back in 1947, this court, in the bruce's juices case, made clear, in the early days of the act, that it takes two completed sales to violate the act. no one sale can violate the act. even earlier than that, the third circuit, in the shaw's case, in 1939, laid down that rule, and it's been an accepted rule of robinson-patman act jurisprudence for that entire time. and it is a natural reading of the statute, and in accordance with the general principle, that this statute should be construed consistently with the larger body of antitrust law.
 i apologize. again, we're submitting that congress understood the term "exhaust" in a particular way, given how it's just generally used in the administrative context. and with respect to the eeoc context, we think that that is inapposite, because primarily that  the relevant statutes in those contexts invoke the word "commence," which 
well, a couple of things, justice souter. i would agree with you if what we were talking about is suspending the right as to citizens within the continental united states, but all congress did here is restore the law to the understanding of the law that had prevailed for 200 years. now, this court obviously took a different view 
the question presented is  is only sovereign immunity, isn't it? it's  we don't have to decide whether there might be some other type of immunity.
no.
well, for me 
it's not asking them to make a contribution. it's asking them, is it okay with you if your money is used for this purpose. but keep in mind what the money is being used for here.
if you're going to the standard, which is, i think, the  actually, the difficult question here, what's wrong  should you say  what's wrong with saying  which is what i was pursuing  that, where there is a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police, the only real question is, is a later initiation "the fruit"?
 where the court 
more than 15, yes, your honor.
yes, but i  if i understand you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise ships. it's limited to ships that come into  passenger ships, which would include the queen mary and queen elizabeth, all the rest of them. wouldn't it?
no one is denying that. i mean, we've had a knock and announcement requirement for 900 years.
 do you have any response to that policy concern? [laughter.]
i think we would still be discussing whether the subjective functioning of an officer's mind is relevant for fourth amendment purposes, which turns upon whether the action was reasonable in the case of an arrest 
well, in other words 
well, the limitation is, as your honor states, if it's a  for a valid law enforcement purpose or to promote rehabilitation or 
on a theory that 
you're saying the application is the application  the petition for certiorari is the application?
those cases are all  all based on thermtron. you don't have any doubt that thermtron would come out the other way today, do you?
why?
right.
 when we went to the summary judgment motion. and that's why the district court was very clear that the issue 
it would be my position that in all of those cases, there was a causal connection between the evidence found in the 
well, your honor, the judge  our argument is in part that the judge had no power to authorize it. if i understand your question, with respect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this doesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular type of relief and get granted that relief. the petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of appeal within 17 days. the petitioner here sought, which is the only thing he could do under the rules, is seek to reopen for 14 days.
so far as united states law is concerned, it could.
i don't, off the top of my head, but i  you know, the distinctions that  in talking with the postal service here, i mean, it may  it  one would  think it might have happened, but perhaps it hasn't. hopefully, it hasn't. but, if it has, i mean, it's a fine distinction. and any tort  you know, a first-year tort student knows that tort lines can, you know, give rise to difficult analysis at times. but if you understand that what congress was trying to protect here was the movement of the mail and the handling of the mail in a way that the postal service does 
i take it we've done that in the conscientious objector cases, united states v. seeger and gillette.
and on your theory it would easily be met no matter how severe the control. i  i take it on your theory, if  if the  if the rent control ordinance said, $5 an apartment, that's the top rent, fine with you because it's extraordinarily efficient in relieving poor renters from the  from the burden of  of high rents.
 that is actually to be used, so there is specific approval by the secretary.
we're just throwing up our hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute of limitations.
well, i do think that there's an integral relationship to the  between the two. that is, that the predicate for abstention has always been that congress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the rights of both sides. here, you don't have that fundamental guarantee. indeed, if you adopt the government's reading here, the  they have said that they want to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the first wave. you will then be left with 75 trials that take place without even the most basic question of what the parameters are that these commissions are to operate under.
well, supported by the record is something of a judgment call. you'd have to assume that mr. claiborne was found by the police, 6 months after he had previously been arrested for crack offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the very first time after his arrest that he had been in possession of drugs, that just he got extremely unlikely, the police caught him.
neither one. neither one is identifying which schedule 2 or schedule 3 substance may not be used.
 up on justice 
was there  was there a cert petition in bulger itself?
which  which you're saying 4 they did not do. i mean, just to get it 
delay or damage 
justice souter, we do not concede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis for relief in this case. we believe that the purported harmless error analysis that the cca applied was so interwoven with a rejection of the federal constitutional 
all right. so then 
no, no. but  but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?
you just said suppose  why should i not say that? i mean i'm not going to do it, necessarily. but why could i not say, would it be wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot banners? is that a correct statement of the law or not? in your opinion.
sure. well, i think the conference report clearly represents the view of the author of the conference report with regard to the meaning of the language.
 under the circumstances.
we do care about the regulations.
do you think the question of the application of brecht is included within the questions presented?
ms. rivkind, i really don't understand what harm is done here. i can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says, "the jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances," which are  have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute  "shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating," and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. okay? then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. i don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is "heinous, atrocious, or cruel," and that is later found invalid by the state supreme court. but then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, "don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime." now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, "heinous, atrocious, and cruel," would also have found that "heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed. so, what harm is done?
i was just going to say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. and when you do live with someone else, you compromise your individual privacy interest to that extent. we know that you compromise it to the extent that if you happen not to be there, and that person says, "sure, come on in and search," that's going to bind you, as well. why is it  why do you not compromise the expectation to the extent of giving the other person the right to consent?
and some aren't. but  but you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the corps of engineers.
why is that?
that would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says.
that was the deal they came to. why should we kick it over? they came to that arrangement, and it was approved by congress, and now you come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. you should  you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it. i  i  it doesn't seem to me to be fair.
part of his claim is  is selective enforcement. you know, maybe he did trespass, maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land. but they are beating on him because of what they say is his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the government is entitled to. to what extent was any of the administrative approval of the blm agents' actions, to what extent was that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this reciprocal easement from him? because i don't see that it's legitimate at all.
yes. we believe that the procedures that ohio provides are  are more than adequate because it gives the prisoner notice of the charges and an opportunity to contest the placement decision. in fact, we believe that the  the process that ohio provides is more than is necessary to satisfy due process.
there was an argument made, mr. olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.
no, we 
that is the standard that the courts of appeals have generally applied. i can't recall a case where the court actually reversed an ends of justice finding. there may well be one based on a legal error where it was some obvious ground that  that is not a basis for an adjournment such as 
their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. under 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.
the right to receive 100 percent is  is dependent on a factor, isn't it?
it violated the controlled substances act. and the d.a. had taken the position, before oregon acted, for example, that the fact that a doctor prescribed controlled substances for purposes of a suicide was a basis for revoking his license.
thank you, mr. pincus.
because the right to subrogation exists independent of the contract. this court has said that numerous times. we've cited cases in our brief going back into the 1800's.
then you just repeat the process one step backward.
well, again, even if the court thinks there may have been some chance, may have been  you know  relevant testimony  this court can well disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of discretion. if it were federal rule of evidence 403, you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion. whether it was unconstitutional, so clearly unconstitutional as to merit under aedpa and under brecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the fact 
thank you, mr. long. the case is submitted.
is that the law in kansas? i mean, i thought  correct me if i'm wrong, because i may have made a wrong assumption here  i thought the finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface to a determination as to whether aggravators or mitigators predominate. and, based upon that determination, there will be a decision as to whether the sentence should be death or life.
right.
counsel, is my 
no. the state loses. it's the state that has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they are 
no, but that  that means if it's a taking at all, it's got to be a regulatory taking. but justice kennedy's question is what is the test for determining whether it is a taking.
well, another case came about later which held that as early as 1998 in another case involving the same department, that there was clearly established law.
right.
but we have said that remorse extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment purposes, under factor (k).
and  and does the review correlate it in any way with these particular deprivations? i mean, what is the review  how does the review correlate with their inability to get reading materials?
it's a 
mr. minear, what do you say are the practical consequences from the federal government's perspective of going  of disagreeing with the u.s. position? what harm is done? can the u.s. protect itself in any event under other clauses?
why does it matter? that is, why doesn't the  you're suing the teacher or the principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that principal really reasonably thought the situation was? i mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of the school group, if the principal reasonably thought that this was a school outing, if the principal reasonably thought that students are staying together, why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take the case, we should take it that way, because the principal reasonably thinks?
yes, i  the best i can find in that court of appeals opinion, at the moment, is that they do reject the idea of diminished responsibility, on mott  on the ground of mott. that's true. they say, "don't even consider it." but i didn't think diminished responsibility went to the question of whether he had the requisite intent. i thought insanity went to that, as they use those words. what is "diminished responsibility," if it isn't, "we admit the intent  we admit that he intended to kill the individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as responsible as an ordinary person would be"? what is  -
because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your  your analysis, if the judgment of the state court were final.
the dismissal, of course, followed the settlement. what the complaint is, is that they were not consulted about the settlement process. and it would have been of no benefit had they been consulted about the settlement process. the defendants were only going to pay a certain amount of money. had the state shown up at the settlement hearing if  or the conference, if there was such a thing, no doubt it would have taken the position that it takes here, that it's entitled to be paid in full.
but we have not decided fourth amendment issues on the basis of the law of property, have we?
yes, justice ginsburg. if  if  in the face of the facts that we have in the record  and that's not a  i don't know that that's a fact. let them present it to a jury if they say that that's the reason. when they have a situation where the crude oil is as low as it's ever been since the depression, when they say they've saved $850 million on their joint venture, and when they say there's excess capacity, even  you don't need to be adam smith to know that the prices are supposed to go down. and what happened instead? they went up and they went up dramatically.
that would go to whether the statement was voluntary, it would not go to 
i don't  i don't think it  i don't think it will, and certainly no more problems than the  than this court has wrestled with, and the lower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of public concern. i think it's a common inquiry to determine what a person's job duties are. and i think it's a very important place to have a clear line, just as there is a clear line with respect to matters of public concern.
well, but  but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as  as judges apply it in  in similar cases. you're not suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to say that in those cases you typically would grant an injunction?
i  i cannot, your honor, and that's why i  i responded as i did, which is that i know of no evidence.
and if the burden does shift that way 
thank you, ms. dahl. mr. mills, we'll hear from you.
and that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.
but  but if the court  (laughter.)
well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty. the statute may be clearly addressed to that issue. it hasn't come up before.
but to be a real gun, it has to be operable.
are you relying 
all right.
well, i'm not going to say that we wouldn't, depending on how the court analyzes this case, argue for a submission that that's not 
that he had been put on a suicide watch and that he had tried to injure himself by knocking his head against the cell wall?
no, justice breyer. it's not because he cut the review out. rooker-feldman is an issue of appellate  the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. so what does appellate jurisdiction mean? well, appellate 
i take it that we are operating under the assumption that software is patentable? we have never held that in this court, have we?
well, we believe that the 
let me just be sure i understand the point. if instead of saying as defined in x, the second statute had merely quoted the same words that were in x, would your argument be the same? official
and is 
now, you're saying that is an instance where, if you bring the party in and he destroys diversity, you're out. that was true before this statute.
most 
yes, your honor. i think it applies in the same way that lack of diversity would apply or lack of a federal question could apply, as in the mottley case. even if it was in front of this court, if it was recognized in front of this court, at that time it would  it must be dismissed.
it was a big enough issue to be the subject of comment among many courts over the decades. it was a big enough issue to be covered in the treatises  the expense was not great, but it was a recurring mitigated issue.
it just doesn't seem to 
one more sound check. does that 
well, the  we don't contend that the second step of the correlation is independently patentable even though the argument is framed as a  argument. what we contend is patentable and what's allowed by diehr is the inventive spark of putting together the discovery of the correlation with a way found elsewhere to measure these important bodily chemicals to produce a diagnostic test.
general long, do  do those states that apply stay and abey make a distinction between whether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has exhausted some claims in state court and ones who haven't?
well, the 
they  they don't necessarily disagree. the government just says the  the issue doesn't have to be reached in this case.
does it make any difference that the review was discretionary in the ninth circuit? what if before the act was passed there was an appeal as of right to the ninth circuit? wouldn't your argument be exactly the same?
 you do agree, do you not, that the government does not agree with you on this point?
and  and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?
we 
right.
in this time around or in the preceding 
well, suppose a sheriff somewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel sues him under state property law. and state property law, they say, entitles me, says the counsel, to this letter. it's mine. it was sent to me. now, if that happens to be the interpretation of the judge in the state of x the sheriff can keep the letter, wouldn't you say that that property law of the state is invalid in light of this provision of the treaty, which is the law of the united states self-executing?
mr. chief justice, i think  they don't  i'm not aware of those cases using 
they didn't 
so they hire more than one person.
no. it doesn't cover 
right.
we also believe there is a liberty interest. these people came to the u.s. in danger. the mere fact of labeling them essential to the united states and bringing them in in the pl-110 status, taking away their identity, giving them a false identity, false references, changing their occupations, all of those things we believe  we have an argument  created a liberty interest in continuation of the protection. it's the special relationship, the dushane-type argument that the  that the ninth circuit relied on. but i would hasten to add it is premature to determine whether we win on the merits, and the government is absolutely wrong in their brief in suggesting that unless we can prove at this point that we can win on the merits, that we don't have standing. we have standing to make a claim for fair procedures. those procedures may include confirming internally to the cia our identity and they may include confirming whether we satisfy whatever the need-based standard is that the cia has identified. we have made every possible effort to comply with the covenant that totten imposed in a contract, a contract that we don't believe we have. we sued as does. we have sought preapproval of every single filing. we had  counsel that learned any confidential information were precleared by the agency. that is not what happened in totten. those are procedures, as justice scalia has suggested, that did not  were not recognized at the time of totten just like the due process claim was not recognized at the time of totten. and it is a claim that can be done internally to the cia.
he doesn't say it deprived him of his property which is his business.
have there been any cases in the circuits holding that the state can waive the jurisdictional limitation on coa?
i think that you have to look at the definition of indian country. if you look at the definition of indian country, it requires, with respect to the properties we're talking about, federal set-aside and federal superintendence.
 on the 
mr. chief justice, we would distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where someone is seeking protection from an imminent or present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's making a more generalized report of criminal activity or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a narrative form about the past.
if i  if i understand what the situation is, there is no death penalty in kansas as a result of this decision.
your honor, i'm not aware of that happening. but what i would say  the point that i would like to 
well, your honor, if they are, then we are, also 
i don't think it's proper to say if you don't give this person death then all these other things which are bad for society are going to happen.
but there was another ground.
 when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.
that's correct. not because, what this statement did. especially 
you  you mentioned the state file. is  is the rule whatever is in the state file, even if there's no reference to it? you had  you had two variables: one that there was reference to it; and two, that it was in state file. suppose there's no reference, but it is in the state file. what  i'm  i'm not sure what rule you would draw?
well 
i think that's a better articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the way 
absolutely, and they, i guess, were looking at english practices, and would they have thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?
no, but just as a factual matter is it correct  is it correct as a factual matter that the confession that was given was a confession that was given before there was any judicial intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?
but the  let's approach it a different way. on a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are two facts i think that can be assumed. number one, there was no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you. the misrepresentation was to the broad market and was reflected in the broad market price.
 i think that's 
thank you, counsel.
that  i agree with that, mr. chief justice. but the practicality is that a patentee starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent is valid. there is a presumption of validity. and to challenge that patent  that presumption of validity, is a very difficult undertaking. most of them don't bother. why would they? if they are receiving  if they're receiving 
i know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it.
we think that under your cases, such as pena v. lane, there needs to be a specific reference to money damages. this simply is referencing declaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would allow an award of money damages. rather, the party must go to the claims court if they're seeking money damages. and in fact, the waiver of sovereign immunity there is somewhat broader. it does, as mentioned before, allow implied or express contracts. so this suit is simply in the wrong court. but i would like to 
of course, you know, we can play the game  5 minutes, 20 minutes 
may  may i interrupt this 
that's correct, mr. chief justice. and because of that, we have never had an opportunity to have our federal takings claim decided on the merits. we believe that that undermines the federal courts' primacy in deciding federal questions, particularly federal constitutional questions. we also believe 
what's not stated?
but what is the difference between asking whether something is implicit in the, in the prior art and simply asking whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?
yes.
well, the rule that has existed for some time now, going back to bell v. hood, is a  a fair way to look at this. if a statute, a federal law, creates a cause of action, then a cause  a cause of action lies absent congress expressly limiting or qualifying an  a jurisdictional element within its grant contained within that law, which is  which is missing completely in title vii.
what this display says 
but if it has the capacity 
well, that  you  you could say that. i mean, i would  on the merits of the question, i  i would like to  if we were reaching that, i would argue that the ninth circuit  that  that there is  there should be a limit on questioning in a  in a summers detention, and the court should apply the kind of terry analysis that the majority of the  the circuits apply.
but, i mean, the court needs to appreciate that for the universe of public employee free-speech cases, they're mostly decided at summary judgment; they aren't decided on the pleadings. that's already the case. and all that adding a job-duty element to it is, adds complexity and requires more factual development. it  there's a number of issues here. first of all, what counts as part of an employee's job? does the speech have to be required by the job, or merely related to the job? how do you judge if the speech meets the test? do you go by the job description? common practice? what if the employee's speech is not required by the job, but some independent ethical duty compelled him to come forward 
it's the undergraduates that know how to do that.
going back to my question, isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the police experience in case after case, that where there  where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't need to knock and announce because those circumstances will be present in most cases?
well, if you're going to use the public use prong of the  of the  the constitution for what we think are regulatory takings, then what happens is you just invalidate the regulation. you don't pay compensation.
well, of course, the reason the lines are straight is nobody is there. (laughter.)
our position is that it's not a component of the final product computers that are made abroad. what is a component is a replication, a copy of a new hard drive or a new disk that's made a part of those computers which, without which 
 with respect to the 
what's the second statute? there's no second statute here. there  there is your concession of the fact that there has to be judicial review. that's what's driving all of this. and  and generally speaking, when we find something to be unconstitutional, we don't rewrite a statute so that it will be constitutional. we just say, you know, there has to be judicial review.
is that correct? there were two errors in the 
would it, would it be lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to keep it alive?
i don't think that distinction holds up. and i think that we see that both in clemons and in stringer. and this takes us to a misunderstanding of the mississippi statute. in mississippi, the statute has not changed since the time of clemons, except for one provision, and that is the addition of another category of capital murder. in mississippi, death eligibility is decided by the definition of "capital murder" in section 97-3-19. and the state lists, i think, now nine  i think it was eight at the time of clemons  categories of capital murder. the defendant then goes to a penalty phase, and the statute sets forth aggravating circumstances in mississippi's statute, section 99-19-101. there is a correlation between many  at the time of clemons, all of the categories of capital murder and the aggravating circumstances, much as there is in louisiana. however, there are two additional aggravating factors at the sentence-selection phase, and those are the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" aggravator, which, in mississippi, is only a selection factor, and whether the defendant had a prior conviction. and so, in this sense, we  the mississippi statute is very comparable to california. and it goes further, because, in mississippi  in clemons' case, if you look at the joint appendix, at 24, and also in stringer's case, at joint appendix 10  the juries were instructed, pursuant to the mississippi standard capital-sentencing instructions  the very first opening paragraph tells the juries that, "in determining penalty, you must objectively consider the detailed circumstances of the crime." and i think this instruction helps explain the court's footnote 5 in clemons, which i think is very important in terms of understanding why this whole focus on circumstances of the crime is not relevant to the distinction between "weighing" and "non-weighing."
under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?
yeah, but you could say any violation of a regulation is unjust.
may i just ask one 
i believe turner and o'lone are prison cases that talk about what the constitution means in prison, understanding that in prison there need to be changes to what we would otherwise see as the inmates' constitutional rights if they were not in prison.
 of years?
full sweep of the commerce power.
can i ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552.  what is it, 109? i think they are contradictory. now, the agency has come up with a solution. we will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but  you know  close enough for government work. what is your solution for solving the inconsistency? are both of the regulations bad?
all the other sovereigns you mentioned do not consume the gas  or the gas sold to them is not consumed primarily on the roads of this state, except for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns. i mean, they simply aren't sovereign. that's the state, itself. they're subdivisions of the state. so, it's making exemptions for its own  its own state, plus exemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those sovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the roads of this state.
what if you have a very complicated dredge and it takes two people? one of them does nothing but  but operate the steam shovel that pulls up the goop and puts it in the  in the barges. okay? and the other one moves the dredge. you say the one is  is covered by the jones act and the other one isn't? no, it can't be. if the function of the vessel is dredging, anybody who is performing that function of dredging is covered by the jones act. don't you believe that?
well, i'm  i'm surprised you set the bar that high. if we're going to 
any suspicion  he strikes one black from the jury.
you had three  three reasons you were going to give justice souter. one is it's not clear always that it's definitive. the other is that trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?
thank you, mr. stancil. ms. williams.
you don't want us to decide it on that ground, do you, so that all future cases you'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 or after '94, right?
your honor, the ability to retrieve information that is stored somewhere out on a server is not the raw transmission functionality. it is more than that. it is what the congress has said it is, it is the ability to retrieve information. it is not simply sending bits over a line and having those bits not changed and not interfered with. when you retrieve something from a server, you have to take it in form it is on the server, you have to then put it through the transmission system, and you have to reconvert it back into what you want to see. it's an interactive process that is more than just sending information.
the state can certainly protect the interest that is protected by the first amendment right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so, it can only do so if it does not infringe on other constitutional rights. and if it does then the question is whether the state's regulation that infringes on other constitutional rights, in this case the union's first amendment right of political advocacy, whether that infringement is justified by a compelling state interest.
well 
this aspect of the court of appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the judgment that it reached, which is correct.
 if you think of the  any conceivable basis  doesn't even have to be offered if the  if it's, indeed, the rational-basis test. it has been suggested that something more is going on in cleburne, and, i think, in all candor, one would have to say so. because if you looked at the rational-basis test that had gone before, this one looked no better, no worse.
they are both equally within the plain language.
 that it was based on the florida 2-year statute of limitations.
everybody makes some sacrifices.
your honor, actually i  i would not have viewed it as outside of congress' contemplation or intent because congress  and i think this is an important part of legislative history. congress in 1990 enacted the ada, and they adopted the employer definition from title vii. and at the time that congress adopted title vii's employer definition for the ada, all but one circuit court had decided that this was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. and if you decide something is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, you take with it the unfairness. and i'm not going to contend that it's not sometimes unfair to parties, some of the consequences of subject matter jurisdiction. but you take that with it when you decide that it's a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. and congress in 1990 adopted for the ada the title vii definition. so it's implied that they understood what was going on. in 1991, they  they had the civil rights act and amended and provided for jury trials in these types of matters. and again, congress was aware of the state of the law.
it's our  it's our reading of the rule that  that the language employed in subsection (b) implies some affirmative action of  of the court.
yes. certainly, just as "breach of fiduciary duty" and "breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing" are state-law claims, negligence is a state-law claim, all of those give rise to variations, state by state. but what congress was getting at were fraud claims that were federal-law fraud claims. and, when it did so, it was heightening the pleading requirements and, seeing what people were doing was taking what were federal-law claims and migrating them to state court under, ostensibly, more lenient standards 
the  if i may answer that by saying that people use the word "software" in two different ways. one of which, they use it as the intangible series of 1's and 0's. we submit that the correct way to understand the word "software" is the physical manifestation of that what is called source code, which is made into object code, which is made into machine readable code.
well, in the citizens publishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the court's ruling there to find that the joint venture was unlawful, was it?
except at least as to the second, at least as to the second, i don't know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional. that's the one of the three characteristics that i think we have always attached the word "jurisdictional" to, i think.
well, of course, we wouldn't even have to venture into  possibly have to venture into this issue of law if texas were interested in following the determination of the president. i take it that the suggestion that your brother has made, that, in fact, we take no action at this point so that they may return to texas with the president's determination, is not appealing to you.
may i  may i ask you one question about the procedural posture of this case? this is an appeal from a preliminary injunction. that's how it got here. and we have been discussing, mostly, the case just as though it had been a permanent injunction. the  there are pieces of this case, like the treaty and what it allows and doesn't allow, that  where the record is so thin. is there a way of dealing with this case so there is the full airing that it never got, without resolving, at this point, other issues 
there are an awful lot of private bridges.
and was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later?
and we  we argue that there are three independent bases, federal bases for finding that the application of egregious harm in this case to be violative of federal rights. and i'd like to turn to the first of those arguments. petitioner plainly objected that the special issues and verdict form did not allow for consideration of his mitigating evidence. that was and remains his core argument throughout this case.
thank you, mr. verrilli. mr. strain, you have 4 minutes remaining.
well, because it doesn't adequately official explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go through in order to evaluate this case. i mean, it is true, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that there's nothing wrong with it. but it is not an adequate statement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient, it doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue. i mean, it seems to me 
 the employer had the same interest in both cases. the question in givhan was the fact that it was an internal report to the employer: did that matter? did that reduce its protection? and the court said no. so, the only thing that it would take to make givhan exactly like this is to put it in the employee manual or make her an ombudsman so it's  so there's not even room for argument that it was part 
theoretically, yes.
 i think that's because they were using the version of stage one that you are using, which includes, in the consideration of whether congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the  whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as i understand it, should be left to stage two, exclusively.
i 
yes, your honor.
 foster development.
well, the duty was to eradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory pay practices that preceded the enactment of title vii and were alleged to have been maintained for racially purposeful reasons after title vii became effective to a public employer. there is no contemplation in that case that that duty would require an employer to investigate discrete employment decisions made in years gone by that weren't made the subject of a timely charge. what this court has said repeatedly is when the charge filing period passes and no charge is brought, the employer is entitled to treat that past act as if it was a lawful act. that's what justice thomas' opinion in morgan says. that's what, the opinion that justice stevens wrote for the court in evans.
 i said, i think there are four reasons for that.
yes, your honor, there is 
justice o'connor, it is possible that the supreme court was not aware that defendant's mother had testified in the 
was there  was there any showing at all of whether they made the police  or the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?
they  you say they don't want to go to california to do an audit.
i know all that. i'm just really interested in your view of the patent. that's what i'm trying to get to.
or  or at least  at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.
 your honor, but i believe that the proper exercise of judicial restraint is to decide the question presented, and only the question presented, and do the other grounds for perhaps another day. all of katz's  all of katz's novel arguments raise complex constitutional issues and, quite frankly, ask for radical alteration of this court's jurisprudence.
no. and in this case the  but  but level 5 as a classification is a limited confinement. it is reserved for those very dangerous inmates not dissimilar to sandin.
i think that you've said that the two were different. his question was how can you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the difference between those two things that you've mentioned? sure they're different but  but the evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks like evidence of the other.
i don't think it's strange at all, justice souter, and that is because that the business exception, if i can call it that, is a carve-out. what you have here, in this court's word, is a sweeping prophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. that's what this court called it in lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis. and what congress did was back out 
well, suppose a non-christian, say a muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong christian beliefs, a very religious person. does he feel like an outsider? and to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.
how can it be final action and yet still be pending?
okay, the 
so she adopts the interpretation of her predecessor?
thank you, mr. smith. mr. stewart?
 official action is  is different from  the problem with ellerth was that if there's nothing formally that had been done, the employer  this  ellerth was concerned with vicarious liability, nothing official. there had been none  the boss wouldn't know about it. but somebody who is suspended, that is an official  that's a tangible action.
the thing that troubles me, just to  and then you can comment on it  i'm assuming it's possible they thought he didn't know whether it was a martian or not, and that he thought he had a mission in life to kill martians, that they're enemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em. if that was the  what the trial court found, could he be put to death for that killing?
and, justice ginsburg, the reason he said that was because of  of section  subsection (d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a of the petition appendix. that is because the second circuit had held that (d)(4) applies to remands in this situation, and both petitioners and respondent's in their seventh circuit briefing took that position. when we got to this court and we both looked harder at the statutory scheme, we both realized that we were wrong. therefore, judge easterbrook  you know, the one mistake he made was the one we led him into making. but that doesn't change the validity of his jurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only requirement of slusa that goes to the jurisdiction on removal is whether this is a covered class action. the elements of the preclusion defense are then the substantive question of federal law that congress authorized the federal court to make, and it authorized the federal court to make final.
 you, is there any obligation, since you've said there is a compelling state interest  compelling government interest in recruiting, is there some obligation to accommodate, or could the faculty just say, "we choose the causes that we assist and the ones we resist"?
no, he doesn't. he can bring it before the patient is in his office and then the court could issue relief which would be much more consistent with the principles of certainly separation of powers and allowing the overwhelming number of our applications of our statutes that are valid to go forward.
to you read the the patent as  talking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want. it doesn't have to be patented. but the correlation, step 2, that any time you ask a doctor to tell us what you think the results of the test mean, that that's an infringement?
and have it granted.
justice kennedy, that's absolutely right, and i just want to focus you on why it is you now think i lose. we don't lose because that's not our invention. the federal circuit's point was that that this invention, claim 4, does not put an electronic throttle control together with an adjustable pedal. it's do it in a particular way. and let me take you in summary judgment in this case to the declarations and explain why it is that the experts here said you would not have done this. and i just have to urge the court to cross the t's and dot the i's here and pay particular attention to exactly what it is that we claimed and exactly what it is that they said rendered our patent obvious.
yes.
thank you, ms. perales. mr. cruz.
well, in terms of whether they're  if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of their deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was an issue of coercion. but here, that isn't what happened. instead, they used 
 you could  you could surely cure it in some fairness.
now, was there a rule 59 motion made here after the verdict?
i don't 
the issue before this court is whether there's issue preclusion 
well, a jury could find that the pursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than diminishing the risk to others. and that given a choice between using deadly force to terminate a pursuit where the officer himself had escalated the risk versus backing off, letting the offender escape and then perhaps arresting him an hour later at the house.
yes, but that doesn't go to the harm that you're claiming. i mean, we're talking about the, you know, the standing issue right now. and if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of carbon dioxide emissions, right?
that's what rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause. it only says in whole or in part. official
the due process violation is that at the minimum, assuming that  that a weighing is even appropriate here, they never weighed it, and clearly any indication that there was a waiver  a  a weighing of whether mr. stumpf would be put to death as an aider and abetter. they never took eastman's testimony as true and  and the prosecution's position as true, and then ultimately said it would make no difference.
well, our position is, whether or not the prosecutor in this case made an accurate statement during the performance of his job  so, in other words, if his disposition memorandum  if the employer accepted it and agreed with it, and the case didn't go any further, there wouldn't be a basis of first amendment, because normally he is acting pursuant to his job duties and it's up to the employer to evaluate whether or not he's adequately performing those job 
that is a highly exceptional case, and the problem with that is  i mean, if  if we're going to  if you're going to be linguistic about it, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound reasoning because that is not a holding because the  you  you've got not merely to have recognized it under the statute, but you've got to have held it. and that's  that's pretty unlikely.
he also raised the point about this is bigger than william weaver. and that was improper. and when the state court cited what he said, they chose to ellipses that out, and didn't even put in 
i understand. but one of the  the odd result here of a person having to pay more in taxes than they recover  this actually comes up under a fee shifting statute that applies to the internal revenue service where a person could be in litigation with the internal revenue service, the internal revenue service becomes obligated to pay fees because they acted unreasonably. they pay those fees, and then they simultaneously hand the taxpayer a bill for taxes on those fees.
it certainly might, your honor. and, again, that would be  that  an additional bit of evidence to present  to be presented to the suppression court to determine whether the scope of the search was reasonable.
with a different secretary now.
of the one  oh, that point? okay.
well, it's  it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed. i just don't see how the appellate review can function properly.
it  it was a suit against a prison.
well, with respect, justice o'connor, i think there's several points to be made in response to that. first of all, i think the solomon amendment itself is a recognition that the military is not like any other employer for purposes of its policy and its treatments of homosexuals. and i think that, unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a result of a congressional mandate. and 
okay. thank you
do you think it is the norm that, if there are co-inhabitants of a house or apartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in, against the express wishes of your spouse or co-inhabitant?
there, it has to be a level playing field.
but that doesn't necessarily follow from  from looking at a police report. it may well be that we would say the burden never shifts, and he is simply in the position of any other party to a case. if  if the other side has put in evidence that is  is against his interest and he does nothing, then he's in trouble. but that isn't the same as shifting the burden.
but we don't know 
immunity, suit immunity, is you can't be sued anyplace, not in state court, not in federal court; you can't be sued, period. but now it is admitted that you can be sued. that's not in dispute in this case, right?
but there  i mean, there are cases in the  in the courts of appeals saying that  that rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not aware of cases  the  the  one of the amicus briefs cites cases which focus on the nature of the representation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are generally fought out because in a  in a typical securities case, loss causation is not a difficult issue because the  the bad news is  is announced, the stock drops, and the plaintiff pleads loss causation as a matter of course. it  it's  it's not a difficult burden to satisfy in your run-of-the-mill securities case.
under the terms of the applicable treaties, the icj has jurisdiction to determine, as a matter of international law, if there is a treaty breach. but those treaties also specify the remedy for any judgement of the icj, and that remedy, under article 94 of the u.n. charter, is recourse to the security council. that was explicitly adopted as a political remedy, because it is the prerogative of the president and the political branches to determine how to respond. one of the responses open to the political branch, as the united states has articulated, is to decline to respond. and with respect to the nicaragua case, that's exactly what the united states did. in that situation  and that matter was ultimately litigated; judge mikva, for the d.c. circuit, wrote a compelling opinion laying out that decisions of the icj are not judicially enforceable in u.s. courts; they are, rather, matters sovereign-to-sovereign. that same reasoning applies here. it is a matter for the executive to determine how to apply. i would note that medellin also presents an argument  two arguments as to why he's presented constitutional claims. one, a due-process claim. due process was not in the questions presented, as he authored. it was not in the brief that he wrote to the fifth circuit asking for a coa. the words "due process" do not appear in his merits briefs. and, indeed, under the sections  the constitutional sections cited, he does not include the due process clause.
now you're, that's the part precisely which you're following that i don't, that i actually don't know, is the extent to which you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of law, you can allege a fact. you say the person ran over me 
it's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. is that any different from the question as  of was this seizure unreasonable? if you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.
okay, you two are even now. (laughter.)
if the right didn't exist, it should have been denied.
i take it  in  in answering justice scalia, i take it from what you didn't say that none of the  we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as  as restricted as the language in this  this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a  in a very literal way.
we've been down this route before in other cases, like wilson, but it's still a troublesome measure. it's hard for me to believe that if a person has drugs in the pockets of his trousers or on the  next to the chair where he's sitting, that he wouldn't immediately run and try to dispose them. i just think that it's ordinary behavior. and, if that's so, then it would follow that you never have to knock if you're looking for drugs that might be on the person. do you have any comment as to that?
well, then you have to understand young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination 
no. but  but bougas i think is  shouldn't govern the resolution of this case for several reasons, and one that i think is salient with respect to the points that you were raising earlier, justice scalia, is that it really is a happenstance of codification that the terms, established and located, appear together in section 1348. the paragraph that contained established and the paragraph that contained located were enacted in separate years. they concerned separate subjects, and they were always treated as separate provisions until the recodification of the judicial code in 1911. and that recodification stated in its explicit text that the provisions were  were to continue to carry the substantive meaning that they had beforehand and that the arrangement of the provisions were purely  was purely for convenience. and so i don't think it's fair to say that because established and located happen to appear in the same provision of section 1348 that they necessarily should be given different meanings.
okay, so 
i'm just wondering what your position is.
isn't there an exception when you couldn't find out?
the difficulty, again  it comes back to the lack of consent. had he had consent, it would be different.
and when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event. you usually talk about presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.
what's your strongest case from this court to support your standing allegation?
your honor, respectfully, if we look at the changes that were adopted in 1367, not a single one of the ones you're hearing argued today anybody can seriously argue are significant. for example, the zahn issue. zahn has no material significance on litigation in the federal courts. and why is that? it's because most plaintiffs don't want to be in federal court. these plaintiffs are different. and incidentally, by the way, this is not 
but if the parent's procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement. you're saying that's the entitlement of the child, but if the parents are going to have any procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right; isn't that correct?
although you say it can be retroactively validated.
yes, exactly as in virginia. in jackson v. virginia, the court recognized that the  the virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the virginia court of appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. and so michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in virginia.
i believe the district court's jurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is limited to the agency record.
that's right. every single ad that we're aware of, has the beef check, which is the sign that the beef  or the reasonable observer would know that this is a statute passed by congress containing a message that americans should eat more beef, that beef is nutritious, that's disseminated under a program that's carefully supervised and controlled by the secretary of agriculture.
counsel, can i ask you sort of a basic question that i don't really think is adequately addressed in the briefs? you contend, as i understand it, that the exception in 2680(c) covers this case.
you won on it. but the difference is that that doesn't give you treble damages.
this isn't a public safety matter. they're  they're not smelling for bombs. they're  they're smelling for contraband. and according to you, that is bad.
you're saying the municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people to take advantage of, is just washed out. one mistake at the lowest level and you get damages and you get attorney's fees. that  that is extraordinary.
well, i suppose you can say, yes, you can have an as-applied challenge, but this one doesn't meet the test.
yes, your honor.
but that probability does not support the truth of the statement that the person or property so described is now concealed at the place for the issuance of the warrant.
thank you, mr. phillips. mr. minear, we'll hear from you.
why do you need equitable tolling? why can't you use, why isn't it most sensible to use the model when  for the time clock on direct appeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the highest court of the state, when does the time, when does that judgment  it's a final judgment if you seek cert, right? but the time clock, the one year doesn't begin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't that right?
but in  in the city of boerne, didn't we say that congress couldn't come in and simply rewrite some part of the constitution to make it read differently than we had?
 here between 
mr. chief justice, i don't believe that was unfair surprise. the court of appeals called for the record back from the district court after it had otherwise finished with the case and while cert was pending. that was reflected in the docket sheet, and we've cited that in the joint appendix at page 8. there was 
it was potentially revealed. it did not actually reveal any details.
yes, your honor, and that they can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way where the race predominates over the other values because we have a political agenda of protecting some other incumbent in a non-minority district.
justice souter, i think that we're getting off track by assuming that it helps for it to be government speech. my point is that a central theme of this 
but apart from that, you can't sue counties in tort.
in  in this particular instance, i think it was fulfilled because settlement negotiations resulted in $550,000 that the petitioners, in all likelihood, would have never received 
does the restatement have some specific provisions that say no matter how good the warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's a  i don't know  dangerous product or defective product or something?
why would it have? because there i think we are talking about liens and it doesn't cover liens, the specifics statute.
well, it's  i think it's  it's more than that in a couple of respects. it  it explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that  that  who live in a world filled with adolescents. and  and the very fact that science  and i'm not just talking about social science here, but the important neurobiological science that has now shown that these adolescents are  their character is not hard-wired. it's why, for example  here's a  here's an interesting and relevant scientific fact. psychiatrists under the dsm, the diagnostic and statistical manual, which is their bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial personality before the age of 18 precisely because before the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed even with respect to 
the historical facts here are whether mr. harris was driving excessively, whether he was driving across the line, whether he was driving at high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his path, whether he had collided with anyone. i think the question about whether or not those facts give rise to probable cause to believe that harris was a threat of serious physical harm is a legal issue, and i think the court of appeals recognized that in this case when they applied a different analysis or came out with a different result to those same undisputed facts.
mr. baughman.
 as a result of having left. whereas, otherwise, otherwise, if he had stayed in the country, he would be eligible to apply for suspension of deportation 
the statute explicitly says, justice o'connor  this is on page 2 of the petition  the incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel. and then section  that's section 3408(c)  section 3410 then describes, in a little bit more detail, the physical operation of the reports that the distributor has to make, and the distributor has to pay the tax.
we did not, but 
really what they are alleging is a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here, that had some  what they claim, a market effect. and it is the agreement that they contend is an unreasonable restraint of trade or they refer to the compensation payments as excessive commercial bribes. they say that violates the robinson-patman act. the trouble is no matter how you phrase this, no matter how they could amend their pleading, inherent in the case are challenges to tie-ins and alleged excessive compensation payments that under the securities laws have to be regulated by the sec. the government has to speak with one voice on this issue under one set of standards, or administrative law gets frozen. and there's a huge deterrent effect on underwriters.
we had a little mini-trial on that in front of the  in front of the district court, and  and i made that argument, your honor, and the district court rejected it.
right.
well, we know what the fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.
ordinarily, justice kennedy, the answer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of the charge. and, indeed, i think councilman itself is a  is a case in which there was a charge at issue, and the question was subject-matter jurisdiction. the reason why this is different, however, is twofold. first, the claim that mr. hamdan is making is that conspiracy itself falls entirely out of any authorization of congress. in councilman, the question was  there was an article, article 134 of the ucmj, which was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted to punish drug dealing. and in the case the court said where  this court said, "we will defer as to whether the facts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to violate the uniform code." here, by contrast, mr. hamdan's claim is that the conspiracy charge falls entirely outside of the laws of war as a whole.
 finding that  the  isn't it  aren't we entitled to give a  some presumption of validity?
well, i think you have to say that. otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs  the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was  they  they yelled at her, she was taken into a  a place that was uncomfortable. if  if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.
we're supposed to count economists?
the question has to do with how long of the taking. and at common law 
doesn't your authority under the commerce clause or under  under  over navigable waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?
with respect to the defamation, pure and simple. i agree with you. we  there is a heightened standard of review, but i don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the state courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.
we don't believe that's what the ninth circuit test does, this was a summary judgment entered against us when we had introduced 
but the question is, can  is  is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a prosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating.
 there are. sure they are.
only because i don't know how a storm drain is a water of the united states. that's all. i mean, all of these terms that you're throwing around somehow have to come within a reasonable usage of the term, waters of the united states, and i do not see how a storm drain under anybody's concept is a water of the united states.
mr. chief justice, at a minimum, an attorney seeking to secure a final judgment should check the docket sheet to ensure that a mandate has issued in accordance with when the practitioner believes the mandate should have issued. that's exactly what the advisory committee 
well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties? i mean, one of the reasons why we go the treaty route are the kind of problems that justice breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties. we want two things. we want to make sure that it's a basically fair system that we're dealing with. on the other hand, we want to say, "if we do anything with respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get the same benefit from you with respect to ours." so never mind the revenue rule, isn't it pervasive that  when it comes to enforcing tax claims, that the route that congress has chosen to go, and the executive, as well, has been the treaty route?
are a reference.
if it is an element of the offense, you wait. or if it is an element of what could be the defense in a criminal case. but getting back to the heck question, in heck the court looked to the common law for the appropriate rule to apply to the cause of action that mr. heck was applying. if we look to the common law for the appropriate rule for mr. wallace, we don't come up with the seventh circuit's rule of immediate accrual. we come up with the rule 
 then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in booker. where i think i would amend your honor's proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe what i think is a reasonable sentence and here are the reasons why, in the pre-sentencing  in the pre-booker system, that could have been problematic legally. today, it is not forbidden. but what it should be subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal that take a look at what are the reasons that the district judge articulated for that sentence.
 be permitted 
under our current law, it wouldn't make any difference, would it? because even if they sent the "on the merits" postcard, carey versus saffold says 
and so i think most economists  in fact, everyone i've ever read agrees with that.
that's true. i agree with that. but again, i believe that most of the  the facts upon which these decisions are based and  and ohio asserts in its brief that that's the case in their case too, that people who are placed in level 5 have either been subject of a rule board's infraction hearing or have committed a crime for which they've been convicted while in prison.
i think your formulation is exactly right, justice ginsburg. it doesn't matter to us where the cruise is centered. we do, however, and this court's precedents do, however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that i'm not aware exists. take, for example, a situation in which a cruise comes from england to the united states. it doesn't pick up any passengers here. they just visit. they stop in 15 other countries. they stop here. the same passengers get up on the ship and leave. this court's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave room for the conclusion that says, look, we just don't think 
the first part of it is the way you  the way you trigger the existing forceability option at all is that it has to be in a contract in interstate commerce. that's why in prima paint the court went through interstate commerce rather than leaving that for the arbitrator. the second part is once you have an enforceable agreement, it may be subject to certain defenses. and then in prima paint, what this court did was it looked at section 4 of the act and it derived from section 4 of the act, the one that only applies in federal court and refers to the federal rules of judicial procedure, a rule of separability for these kinds of defenses, for the defenses that arise in the savings clause.
yes. and we here apply the correlation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one in the future, any one that any mind might impend. what's the difference?
i could see how that broad interpretation would raise perhaps for the  clearly raise for the first time the section 101 issue. but, so that should have been clear to you by the time the court of appeals decision came out, right? but did you, in your petition here, rely on 101?
no.
no. absolutely not. i mean, you would  you  there is no rational 
right.
maybe i can answer the question by going around to the court's finding, which was that district 23 was created not as a latino opportunity district, that it would not operate to offer the opportunity to elect the latino preferred candidate. and the  and the district court found this on page 145-146 of our appendix to the jurisdictional statement. and in that same paragraph, they said, but it has a political nuance that congressman bonilla will be elected from a latino majority district.
not that i know of, and i don't  and i  i think if you did that, would you do it for employees too? can all the employees sue? i mean, where  where does it stop? can  if domino's violated a term of a contract because it was  it wanted to cause economic loss to the employee of a subcontractor, can  can he then sue? i mean, looking at the theory of damage in this case shows just how indirect it is. if you look at paragraphs 24 through 27 of the complaint, the sole theory of harm here is that domino's had an obligation to provide a letter to  to jwm, certifying that jwm wasn't in breach of any terms of the lease, and that it refused to provide that letter, and when it did so, the bank denied some financing on a project, and then that caused jwm not to have money to invest in other projects. and so then it didn't have enough money to pay its creditors, and so then it went into  had to declare chapter xi bankruptcy. and then mcdonald didn't get as much money from the corporation as he otherwise would have.
mr. joseffer, maybe you can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works better. the other way.
let me try this again, and i'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly. this is my actual dilemma. if i decide this case against you in my view  and suppose it came out that way  i would be concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the technology area that have real market power in tying products and get people  and they extend that power through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate themselves from attack. i would be afraid of that really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war of experts in a technology area about do we have the power, don't we have the power, and who knows. if i decide this case in your favor, i would then be afraid that particularly in the patent area, there will be lots of instances where new technology, uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does not get off the ground because a very easy way to finance the risk through a requirements contract, for example, so that we make the money if the product succeeds, because people buy the required product at a higher price. that will never happen. and patents is an area where new technology is particularly at risk. so i see a problem both ways, and i'm really not certain what to do.
why, if we're going to catch some additional people, is that not sufficient? that is, why is it unreasonable, say, not for law professors, but business school professors, management consultants, to say, "you have a lot of prisoners in california, hundreds of thousands  i don't know, maybe more than 100,000  and we'll tell the legislature that they can cut the terms, save money, release them early, but we want to have management checks. and the management checks are, you might be searched at any time. and we catch a few. and that's helpful." now, if the 
but is that what the california court would say?
yes.
i'm not aware of any precedent.
i think that  that language was basically a review determination as to what exactly happened. i don't think that the court 
but there's a problem. take the concrete facts of this case. the bad news about  what is it? albuterol?
well, i  we realize that. i mean, we're getting into it because there's at least a potential constitutional problem here.
the cause of action, just like 1983, allows 
but have we seen it in the  there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't there? and have we seen the abuse you're describing?
exactly.
thank you, ms. lee. mr. kneedler.
well 
right.
 act.
no, that exception is 
and i don't think the majority said the contrary. i mean, i wrote it. i mean, i don't know  what counts is what i wrote, not what i thought. but if you read it, i don't think it decides this question. what i wonder, though, is why does the  how does this case present the issue you want to argue? i'm  justice ginsburg made me wonder about that. as i understand it, the trial court said, i'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. all right. and then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. and one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. there could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. that means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. so the appeals court finds no error. now, we get over to the federal court. and they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. very well. we disagree, send it back. end of case. now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and  i mean, when i  it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. how does this case raise it?
if  that depends how it were made. if it were 
 duties.
i would  justice scalia, i don't believe that union means labor union because 
right. but it happens that, the d&e patients were on average two years older, which i think also would be associated with greater risk. so i think it's a wash. but i still think the chasen study net is quite helpful to our side. for one thing, this is a study put together by one of the plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the southern district case, based on a study of his own practice. and of course one of the intuitions about the d&x procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to be a faster procedure and there is going to be less blood loss.
the case is submitted.
 what do you make of the legislative history? i mean, your friend on the other side pointed out that there was very clear testimony to the effect that if the statute passed, with the text that we're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out a series of claims.
 unless you're exceedingly careful.
why?
well actually, i think that when you factor in employment, it has  it has the opposite effect. because what happens here is if you're using employment verification reports, consumer reports about employment, there are all kinds of consumer reports. how do you tell who had the optimal employment history? how could the baseline be the best employment history possible?
well, no, no. the  there was no subsequent entry. you said the initial entry was unlawful. those officers stayed there. their presence there was the product of an unlawful entry.
all these cases  we've had several, not too many over the  the whole line of cases  and the trial judge has always committed a rather plain error. and we all have the case where if you just try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say no. a case just like this. the judge made a mistake, but we've always said that's not something we  we look at.
i  i wrote it. (laughter.)
i'd be willing to stipulate to that, mr. chief justice, but the truth is nobody showed up even for an auction on this property. so we don't have much in the way of evidence as to the value of it. and all i'm saying is the suggestion of  of $80,000 as the relevant number here is a number that's picked out of the air for a purpose that has nothing to do with fair market value. it has to do with the value of a  of a bond that would have to be issued in order to stop the transfer of possession of the property in the ejectment action.
suppose congress said specifically 1983 applies. that's all it says. would that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?
do we take it along with the resolution of the counties? do we look at everything?
i'm sorry, your honor.
why 
the fourteenth amendment, mr. chief justice, race may 
your honor, the reason why we know that is always or almost always harmful is that the incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel, just like the incentives of the participants in a manufacturing cartel 
how about a 
just in the hypothetical, i would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys: make sure i get that claim in bankruptcy. the attorney files a claim. and every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for filing in the bankruptcy court.
your honor, this court's standing cases make clear that you have to show that granting the relief requested is likely to redress the alleged harms. and again, looking at the 
that is correct.
 there would 
yes.
is that right?
and, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get  waste everybody's time and money.
the bankruptcy judge should official examine the claims that have been filed, if any, do the arithmetic, offer the debtor an opportunity 
 about the annual review.
 related to that and some other claims related to that 
is there a security reason when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the law books, in the mini law library?
exactly, your honor, and that's the argument that was made and rejected expressly by this court in bush v. vera, that we had to make an ugly minority district rather than a compact minority district because if we did it the other way, a nearby incumbent would lose his seat. that was precisely the argument that was made there, that it was really incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly district to send that excessive racial message in order to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which is mirrored here exactly and  and as to which i notice the  the state of texas offers no response.
 if officer gillette, the one who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back of his car, instead of having the second officer come with the dog, would it have been permissible? i thought you had conceded that it would be a different situation if the dog was already there when the car stopped.
yes, because these aliens entered the united states only 
so the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything. it doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. if, in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive products at a lower price, wouldn't it?
and even if they lose on it, they still will have  would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised. they're not  they're not so much interested in the so many dollars for this particular representation. even if they lose on what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have raised the question you're trying to raise today.
what  what are you hypothesizing? that the court actually made this finding in its mind but just didn't express it? or are you hypothesizing that the court could have made it but didn't make it, never even went through the mental process?
but isn't  doesn't the mechanism take into account the number of employees who are on the rolls at any given time?
mr. goldstein.
it misarticulated them. i guess the question of application is  i mean, i assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard, they just articulated the wrong standard. your answer, i take it, is that it would then be reviewed without aedpa deference?
there was a legislative expression of position on this particular issue.
exactly.
different claim.
you're saying, i think you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out without somebody telling them?
our position, your honor, is that the phrase "parties in interest"  we were seeking to find out where the court could have applied that phraseology on the defendant's side. and the only place that we could find, in the statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the explanation for removal, that we were not a "proper party in interest." and that's why we focused on that.
if we had proof that they actually acted against what would have been their self-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we would satisfy then the matsushita standard for summary judgment.
well, i  i haven't either. but the judge here certainly was subordinate and 
if it was mandated, yes, it would be unconstitutional.
 this whole thing is a 2241(e) new section. so, this is all about amending habeas.
yes, your honor, but i think considerations likes the opening up of international trade and the development of markets like china to supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the success of the wal-marts of the world than a rule like dr. miles. remember, it's perfectly legal under current law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral enforcement rather than by agreement. so the suggestion that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy if dr. miles is overruled is simply unsupportable.
yes, your honor.
why  why shouldn't you have  what's magic about the jury? why shouldn't you have the same rule on a bench trial? a judge in a bench trial makes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, i shouldn't have ruled that way. why shouldn't that judge be able to change? just because there's no jury to discharge.
 what is the evidence?
well, they are, but in this case, the state knew within 2 weeks of sending the initial mailed notice that it had not been received. that was 3 years before the taking. so there was sufficient time for the state to take some very minimal efforts to provide notice. and remember, with regard to posting, in this case the state actually visited the bryan street property and they did not post a notice or contact the occupants at that time, although they could have done so for virtually no cost at all, no additional effort. and we know from what happened with the eviction notice that had they taken that very minimal effort to post the notice, it would have worked.
 but what you have  what you want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriated property can be used by the owner of the instrumentality as part of the startup capital for his product.
page 3a in the addendum to integra's brief.
perhaps that's all they thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they thought they were doing.
there could conceivably be such cases, mr. chief justice.
no, your honor. it's identical. the  the full tax court 
i'm talking about the plan that they've had for 25 years, and they decided to keep it.
not everyone, but only the ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person from filing a charge. and that would not be every trivial 
yes.
and not the release. you contest that the release makes any change.
but what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three  any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it for reasonableness. and if they don't make findings, it is going to be unreasonable, right?
25 has seven whole counties and only two county splits, which is unusual. most of the cases that this court has struck down what it's perceived to be racial gerrymanders have been a number of county splits. in this case, the county splits  those were mandated to  because we have achieve perfect equipopulosity, so we had to get exactly, within one person, precise lines. but within  in between the two, they are whole contiguous counties that are longstanding geographic units. the testimony is clear that the  the legislature made no effort to avoid anglo voters. it's not like they snaked around. and even the lean of it is a simple fact that the gulf of mexico leans like this, and it follows the geographic boundaries of the state, so that if one examines this district next to the other districts, it follows historic lines that have been used in texas.
well, i think the interest of notice is part of it. i mean, it doesn't always trigger when the state hasn't  or the federal government hasn't answered. but statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in terms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose 
well  it's certainly true that abortion has been dealt with at a federal level one way or another since 1973. so i think that's also part of the backdrop, but i also think, i mean, you know, the federal government gets involved in this issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good or for harm. it's there to protect access to the abortion clinics 
very well, mr. walton. mr. gornstein, we'll hear from you.
yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. you know, we have nothing, what should i say, subordinate about interpretive regulations. in fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.
but the program is nothing until made into a physical manifestation that can be made by the computer.
we're not going to be able to do that in time to decide this case.
of course, you do. so the croupier is  (laughter.)
but is it  is it like in a  in a  take a civil case where the judge gives the standard charge about, "imagine two plates and a scale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find against the party who has the burden of proof"  if we make that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the burden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is  to the equipoise question is, "then you must come in with a death verdict."
so the only thing that's missing there are some facts.
in the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction? official
nor would nollan have come out the same way if they weren't trying to get an easement in return for something which wasn't  which you called extortion.
well, mr. chief justice 
here, they are instructed to consider every mitigating circumstance that's presented and determine whether or not that should be a factor in their decision.
mr. coykendall, the  on the question  you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, leegin?
they're saying there's no losses. i mean, that's  it's inconsistent how the losses come out. you just told us the loss occurs, bang, when you buy it. you've gotten stock that really isn't worth what you paid for it, the notion of  of worth as some  you know, some objective thing rather than what  what people are willing to pay.
well, except for the language of factor (k) itself. and if  without some embellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that factor (k) goes as far as skipper evidence?
yes.
if it's not part of  if it's  if it's not part of your core job duties that you  that employers should evaluate.
right.
does that have any impact on the way they run their business?
but congress 
i mean, i just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our commerce clause jurisprudence. correct me if i'm wrong.
it doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.
then  then would you address the text?
i'm asking about the u.s. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation.
well, again we come to the question of when the plan gets filed. the plan isn't filed until after it's converted, according to the rules.
i  i think that language really cuts very hard against you. a conspiracy offense under this section. it  it is reading as though that's the section that defines the offense, not just the section that provides the penalty.
yes, or after disposition by this court on it 
is there any other case that you can cite where we've upheld a facial challenge and then later said that an as-applied challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial challenge?
now why would there be any difference then? that's a question i was about to put to you. what if there is no indictment at all? why couldn't you say the same thing? well, you know, the only purpose of getting it is to see if there was probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.
well 
so it's not a case of conflict preemption. they're trying to preempt state law whether it conflicts or not, right?
really? that you could take pollutants from a different body of water and add it to an already polluted stream? i thought that was clear that that's not the case.
mr. gold, i know you take that position on the facts of this case, but is it not true that there could be cases in which the verdict of the jury would establish certain facts that would justify going beyond the middle term? for example, the black case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case thought the sentence was permissible in that case.
 ask it 
yes, it's true. but even for members  people who are not actually members of the gang are subjected to the gang pressures. for instance, if  if there was going to be a fight, a planned fight, that was going to break out on a yard, members of a prison gang would tell members of  of their same race that once the fight breaks out, you better be with us because if you're not, we'll deal with you later. and that's even for people who aren't gang members. so the racial pressures in prison are very, very severe. something 
didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year i'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?
 in the new section.
edmund burke say that?
 hypothetical.
your honor, i think i haven't been clear in the test that i'm suggesting.
yes, but this is  this is basically a practical question, and i  i'm trying to get a  i guess because i'm not an antitrust lawyer, i'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is actually working in the system, and i'm not sure that i understand it.
well 
i  i  it's an argument about what the constitution prohibits. it's an argument about where a constitutional line should be drawn.
and it seems to me that the prejudice to the defendant in the two  as between the two situations simply is not comparable. in mechanik you had a situation in which two witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence the other, et cetera. here, we're talking about a situation in which it may very well be that the defendant should never be put to trial at all. and your rule says if there's any question about it, put him to trial, judge.
don't you think that's a little bit different?
if you're going to give me  if you're going  well.
i mean, that's what i don't understand about  about the fact that they won't  won't have the right to counsel. it  it's at least as easy for  for counsel to appear in cases in which indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their own lawsuit.
well, it does on its face. i mean, it is clearly overbroad. now, what should we do about that?
i 
i know, but i have a question i'd like you to go into.
whether it would have been a problem under the marian practice i think is only part of the story. and certainly crawford recognized that affidavits as a category were part of the  of the tradition that led to the abuses that the founders were concerned about. so marian is, again, part of the story but not necessarily the whole thing. now, when we articulate this resemblance 
but if you take it that the government was right  before congress passed the law, the government was right to give the exemption to allow that ceremonial use of peyote, then i don't see how you get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later than congress's is saying, "executive, we agree with you, you did right." but it's not  you  i don't see how you can rely on the congressional statute when the government was doing this even without a 
of course. so then how can "in whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement, because it could be in part and still be a proximate cause. how can that language possibly be interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?
and the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.
well, indeed, the legislative history mentions  and there is a battle of letters between 
what  what happens with my example? i'm curious. that's not a rhetorical question. i have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th street. i search 1518 5th street. was it a warrant  a warrant back search?
well, it certainly is not necessary, of course, to  to  for us to prevail in this case. however, i think it is an important principle to interpret the  the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute, look at the language of that statute, and determine what congress intended from that. and  and i think it also is a dangerous thing to get into, implying exceptions into that statute. but  but let me state this. obviously, in this case we have an action, the  the in rem jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosen action, that is  is miles away from the probate of  of a will. the particular cause of action involved here was an interference with an inter vivos gift. and i think it's important to realize that that was intended to be a gift that would be complete during the lifetime of the decedent. that fact means that this case really has almost nothing to do with probate or probate jurisdiction.
well, it may be more than just administrative efficiency because every prison is different and there are different gang pressures at each prison. and i think it's important for the prison to be allowed an opportunity to bring that transferred inmate in and look at them and how they're going to fit into that prison and have a chance to evaluate their records. it's true that 
may i ask you two questions? first, if there were no such animal as the probate exception, would there have been bankruptcy court jurisdiction over your claim?
yes.
and if you lose, you always have a point on appeal and may start all over again later on.
well, the answer that the solicitor gave  general gave to that was, you could have a pre-enforcement proceeding. that you can back up the clock.
and  and it was admitted and then it was never challenged thereafter until after the verdict.
so there's an intent component to your test now?
i thought that was one of the main indicia of whether an entity had been set up as an arm of the state, that is, the state would be directly liable.
but 
 they're in the same relevant market, of course.
thank you, mr. chief justice.
oh, no, your honor, it is very express in 75 and then again in the 96. capital formation, investor protection and competition have to be weighed against each other by the sec, and in gordon this court attached great importance to that standard, which differs from the competition first standard of, the antitrust laws impose.
it  it is 
 there a narrower class  -
 what we suggested in chickasaw nation.
the case is submitted.
that's correct.
can you give me an example of where they grant leave to appeal, and if not  and it's not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as incorrect 
but at the point it was acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was not that it thought the removal had been proper; the basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.
no, no. but that isn't the limiting part. the limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.
yes, but none of the elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical injury in the burglary case. you can have unarmed burglars.
no, i'm assuming they just did it independently. they said, "we want a regulation on the private mine inspectors, and let's just adopt the  a standard that shall, in all respects, be the same as the federal standard."
i don't think so, your honor.
my question is what if that's somewhat ambiguous? a busy court, he handed it to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the docket. you're not sure, there's a fact dispute about that.
i'm sure they do. (laughter.)
so one of the consequences of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the government because it is open to this kind of challenge for deficiency in title. so you've now devalued the property in the hands of the state.
i was giving you a hypothetical. i 
yes, that would be a discharge into the river.
what that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of dr. miles, every american will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail. now that's one economist, of course. there are other whose think differently. so how should we decide this?
no, no, your honor. in a levy suit the government often does have the property.
but  but may i just ask a sort of very basic question? one of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it  if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?
all right. what about the marriage example? the  the court has said, yes, you couldn't  the  the state can't prevent the inmate from  from getting married. i don't see where the separate source of  of value is that would  that  that would affect that analysis. no right of access to court. the associational rights can be abridged and so on. why, on your analysis, wouldn't  wouldn't the proper disposition of the earlier case have been to say, yes, the state can preclude marriage too because that's something they very much want and  and the state can preclude that unless they shape up and  and get down to a  a lesser level of security?
that is correct, justice scalia.
and this is one i'm  i'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it  i don't think you did  eeoc against arabian american oil company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the united states, title vii coverage, and this court held that anyplace outside the united states did not mean that a u.s. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because congress was thinking in terms of the inter-state sitting  setting and not international.
yes, sir. yes, your honor. what he says 
right. i think that  that is a fair characterization of one our arguments here 
the bankruptcy court sustained our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the total substantially.
the  i think what that illustrates is that congress wanted the issue of immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the court. and one reason that that is so essential under the westfall act ftca scheme is that if the immunity  if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of the employee, that has many, many consequences, including that the united states is the proper defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the federal court, the case must be dismissed until an administrative claim is filed and that avenue is exhausted. all of these procedural and substantive official defenses come into play depending on how the scope of employment issue is resolved.
 hearings, but that $146 million is not just the hearings; it also includes mediation, it includes litigation. and there's no basis to conclude that putting the burden on the parents is going to decrease, rather than increase, hearings. if you let the school systems slide by without being held accountable, they are likely to be less thorough in preparing their ieps, as they were in this case. and when they're less thorough, there will be more understatement, more disputes, and less consensus. may i also point out, in response to justice breyer's point, if there is to be no federal law on this question, if it is purely state law  then it ought to be remanded back to the maryland district court to ascertain what maryland law is on this point. and, justice o'connor, while there is no statute or regulation on point, there are certainly background principles of law that maryland has, just as we've been arguing here at the federal level, that would dictate for maryland where that burden of proof should lie. now, opposing counsel, the government, has pointed out that there are these pleading requirements. but these are not traditional pleading requirements, where one side makes allegations and the other side goes, "admit, admit, deny, deny." if you look on page 12 of the addendum, you see the portion of the statute that requires the kind of response the government must make. it's not admit/deny. it is to give, essentially, a detailed explanation for its position, just as the parents have given a detailed explanation for their position. and, between those two positions, you can tell who should have the burden of proof. i see my time is up. thank the court.
 said there was no edwards violation.
your honor, the first time before this court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold examination of the record 
i  i understand, justice ginsburg, but  but that's not the distinction that i understand this court's decisions draw. several times since douglas and ross, this court has said that the right to paid counsel addressed in douglas extends only to the first appeal of right and no further. and that's  that's coleman and  and finley, among others.
your honor 
well, not quite, your honor. the question  the question is did more than 70 nonexcludable days elapse during this period or not. once the finding was made in march, that's when mr. zedner was incompetent. no further findings was necessary  were necessary, and the time is then automatically excluded. the time prior counts toward the 70-day period whether or not he was in some metaphysical sense incompetent before then. the question is not whether he could have been tried or not in that period. the question is did more than 70 days elapse. and if the judge had decided this matter sooner, mr. zedner would have been  received the treatment he ultimately got much sooner, and the trial would have occurred much sooner. that's the purpose of the speedy trial act. now, the government has abandoned the second circuit's holding to the effect that harmless error analysis applies to a violation of the 70-day limit. that's a wise position for the government take  to take, given this court's holding in bozeman which interpreted essentially the same language. the court there held that where the statute says the indictment shall be dismissed, there's no room for harmless error analysis. that's the remedy that congress chose. so in this case on the  on the  this period of delay we're talking about, more than 70 days elapsed, and the remedy must be dismissal.
you go ahead. you go ahead.
yes. but, was there anything further on willful? you said that the statute was clear enough and you had the ftc informal advice, but now we know that courts have divided on this question, right? on 
 with it. but i think what the third circuit was stressing in its opinion is that you cannot subject the parties to litigate in another forum if there is some chance that your own forum does not have the personal jurisdiction. it is a prerequisite of the doctrine itself. and we believe that 
no, i don't think they're wrong.
 which required all of them to abolish it.
but 
well, it didn't involve this 
in a venue statute, as opposed to a subject matter jurisdiction statute, the venue means where, where  what particular court. subject matter jurisdiction is which court system. they're entirely geared to entirely different things.
most states 
and we don't 
yes.
mr. himmelfarb, what about accessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that argument as well?
in johnson, your honor?
i have one 
 by rapid transit.
you have a malicious prosecution claim for that. you brought that, you lost.
and even then, why do you take the other position? it is pretty easy to imagine the sec, under some circumstances, deciding that's a proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of agreements between ipos or something like that. i don't see why not.
 unlawfully expropriated property can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.
so, it's taxing itself.
right. justice ginsburg, you have to put that in context. the argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with mr. romero. their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and  and is wrong as a matter of law. and there is no evidence  no evidence. there was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. it's very important to understand that.
mr. browning, is it proper to consider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the date the  that the false claim was made or was alleged to be made, then you don't have to get into the question which state's statute of limitations, the choice of law question, and then when you identify that state, which limitation period within that state? i mean, those are two inquiries which can sometimes be rather complicated. they are obviated entirely if we take the 6 years from the federal statute.
justice souther, i think the only thing we can say about that is congress reduced the culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence to negligence. i don't think that tells us much about willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.
okay.
i think your 506(b) argument, i see your point, i see your point, is there  i mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not. i got that point. i also have your point about, well, there are other references. now, is there any other point in the code?
you know 
oh, well.
is it true as the respondents argue that a holding in your favor would call into question thousands of patents?
 i think when you have vast-majority infringing use, they should be on the hook. now, i don't think 
hopefully that's better.  recognize a new constitutional tort under bivens and the just compensation clause that would subject public officials to personal liability for conduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking. recognizing that constitutional tort would require this court to extend bivens to an entirely new context, it would disregard limits that have existed for centuries on just compensation clause claims, and it would skew the enforcement of important public land use objectives and thereby threaten public resources and public lands.
but is there any other objection?
no. no, i was just suggesting there would have to be some unconstitutional condition. well, the due process 
in my view that's probably insufficient 
 it does seem to limit the broad statement in jerome, without mentioning jerome.
well, the record is completely silent on that question. i don't know the answer to that. he was certainly disabled. i will only point out that the standards for total and permanent disability under the department of education regs are much more stringent than those for social security, because that only requires a 12-month period of disability. but i don't know the answer as to him. i do want to get to one other point before i sit down, and  which is to address one of the government's arguments  is that to  to get around a  the problem that the dcia reenacted the 10-year bar, the government relies on the "notwithstanding" clause of the 1991 education act, arguing that it wipes away any time bar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no matter what type of collection is at issue. but, as we note in our reply brief extensively, those "notwithstanding" clauses are not as all-powerful as the government suggests they are. and what the case law  the lower-court case law suggests is that you need to look, as we have done in our submission, at the legislative history and the legislative motive surrounding both acts, the previous act and the subsequent act. and, here, what you have  and i don't want to beat a dead horse, but i will repeat once again that the problem here is  for the government  is that we have this very powerful anti-attachment provision with its express-reference requirement. and the only place in these statutory materials where the express reference occurs is in a  the very act that includes the 10-year bar. and to accept the government's argument, you would have to accept the notion that the  an express reference in an act can go beyond the authority that's granted by that very act.
your honor, that's not the normal practice. in fact, it involves 
was incomplete, and what did the fbi man say it was?
yes, but there's not always a  an express command from congress as to what the remedy should be. once congress says the indictment shall be dismissed, there's no room for a court to say that the indictment shall not be dismissed unless there's some harm shown. so this specific provision trumps the more general provisions of rule 52(a).
your honor, the  in lucas, this court found that a  a complete deprivation of the economic value of property constitutes a categorical taking. but the court has not held  it did not hold in lucas and it has not otherwise held  that a regulation that affects less than a complete destruction of economic value is categorically not a taking. the point of the court's regulatory takings doctrine and the inquiries that it mandates is to determine those circumstances in which a deprivation that is less than a complete destruction of economic value require compensation.
it's 
that's right, because the message from the government is quite different. the message with legislative prayers, as this court found in chambers v. marsh, is a recognition of a long historical practice. but when it comes to the ten commandments, it really is different than even a legislative prayer. this declares not only there is a god, but that god has proclaimed rules for behavior. the ten commandments come from sacred texts. as justice kennedy said in his opinion of county of allegheny, certainly a city council could not put atop the city hall building a large latin cross, even if that city council begins every day with a prayer. it cannot be there just because some religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that everything then becomes permissible.
how do you know what is pending with respect to when the state defendant, movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari? is that 
well, your honor, that was something that was recognized in cannon. i  i think that was cited in several of the footnotes.
yes. where?
but i am correct in assuming that it is  and tell me if i'm wrong  that it is your position, the state's position, that, under the right/wrong prong-two part of m'naghten, and under the evidence in this case, the court was able to consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary in order to meet this defendant's defense as to  as to intent.
why does it make any less sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow separate appeals to this court from each of those? and once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only from final judgment, but you can bring here on certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.
yes, because it doesn't say anything about anybody being a  capable of being a citizen of two different places, whereas 1332 does, which is the unusual situation.
because?
nothing about 
and just  what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving piece?
there is a distinction between nature and quality of one's acts and knowing whether an act is right or wrong. and the state's and the united states position here is not supported by the history of the development of m'naghten nor the ali version of the model penal code.
 basically 
thank you, ms. blatt. mr. wolfman, you have three and a half minutes remaining.
the court of appeals addressed the argument, which petitioner makes, that the definition of "corruptly" that was used in this case is redundant and superfluous in light of the additional intent that 
could the two claims have been brought together? this is  if an employee is in an uncertain situation, doesn't know if the ftca act applies, it certainly doesn't want to be without any defendant for conduct of the kind that  that this complaint charges. could such an employee say i want to bring my tort claims act against the united states, but i'd like to have in that same lawsuit, in case the court says it comes under an exception, my bivens claim? would it be possible to bring those suits together?
well, rule 4.410(b) says that the sentencing judge should be guided by the criteria in these rules.
right.
and the jury must have thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that evidence in. and what reason could it be, other than to show that, if he is given life, he will be a good prisoner?
well, you say they don't, but my question is, can they? and the record may not official show this. i'm not asking you to answer the impossible, but do we have evidence that would indicate that they can or that they can't?
 sorry. the effect of such competition 
yes.
that happened literally more than a thousand times. the testimony on that is rampant. and the reason we don't make more of that, justice scalia, in this particular case, is because the jury verdict is based on actual sales. there is as very clear fidelity to the two-purchaser rule in the way the jury verdict was rendered and the way the court of appeals affirmed it. that said, i  a lot of this discussion about, you know: is that two-purchaser rule, in its most strict version, the right way to interpret the robinson-patman act? our view is, it's not. but we don't have to get there 
that's just what i said. your figures show that the average spending is below, but that's not what's significant. what's significant is what justice breyer posed, where  where there is a contested race and  and some new candidate wants to unseat somebody who's been in there for years. that's  that's where the shoe pinches.
the potential for danger to others is certainly part of the justification for deadly force, just as, if deadly force cannot be used endangering other people, then that certainly goes into the matrix, too.
no.
did the  did counsel suggest less intrusive restraints?
i don't know, your honor, if it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the district court needs to give as many reasons, or as clear a reason for the imposition of the particular sentence. that will help 
which 
i was thinking of district 23.
what about "delay"? does "delay"  your  isn't that something that's neither within "loss" or "miscarriage"?
i'm sorry, your honor?
that may be. we don't 
well, that's  that's part but not all.
is that they all knew that. the point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999. what they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in 2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this case, is do you require that kind of specificity? and it seems to me there's no other way to read what congress says in this statute than to that. i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
could i  could i 
the answer is yes.
all right. tell me why.
that is correct.
the plants are not  the plants are not imported, right? just the tea.
no, no.
it's my opinion, your honor.
but  but if that's the case, then  if  if the relationship between the parties is the same, then the presence of violence or nonviolence has nothing to do with your  your position. does it?
all right. where 
well, no. what i'm  what i'm asking you to do  what i'm suggesting is that the weight of scientific and medical evidence of which the court can take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and did take judicial notice in cases like atkins and thompson and stanford explains and validates the consensus that society has drawn. we're not arguing that the science or what a particular neurobiologist or developmental psychologist says dictates the line of 18. the question is we have a consensus. it's even more robust than it was in atkins. looking at proportionality and reliability with respect to that consensus, is there a good, objective, scientific reason to credit the line that society has drawn? and i'm suggesting two things. number one, that although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather than transient, we know it is impossible  we know this from common sense and it's been validated by science, of which the court can take note, that it is impossible to know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17 year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are exhibited during adolescence. and 
mr. dreeben, you have three minutes.
yes. yes. that would be a closer case. but the  it might fit the policy of the act, but it's a very poor fit with the words of the statute. and 
yes or  does that strike you as strange?
well, your argument there is that 
no, they go 
that's why we proposed one that's based with what the statute means. and  and the statute is very clear. the plain language is unambiguous. that's our first test, which is unfavorable to the employee based upon an objective standard. but if the court felt it necessary to  to back to a position that was not quite so expansive, the eeoc standard is  is the one that's most rational because it's based in the purpose of 704(a).
yes.
but i guess  i  following up on justice stevens' question, your theory with respect to negligent transmission is that the postal service should be liable in the same way that private parties are. but that theory doesn't hold up when you're talk  that's not your theory.
i may have missed, your honor 
sure.
 an instruction 
i'm still a little unclear as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.
 i  i agree with you.
you mean it has not ruled on 
the difference was that it was because it was under the property clause, and made a distinction between property and money.
permissible, mr. chief justice.
wait a minute. the government is not arguing here that  that it's valid. it's just arguing that though it is invalid, the punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go. that's  that's all they're saying.
 "double standard" 
not necessarily.
well 
well, you had to wait because it would  it would be a fruitless act to file the case while the case  file a federal case while the state criminal case was pending. but 
that is not something that we've 1 argued in the briefs. it  it, no doubt, is true 2 especially when you're talking about a pro se petitioner.
i don't think the statement of purpose tells me what the  what the criterion for the different treatment was. i still think it was years of service.
well, are you suggesting then that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of a preliminary injunction? if it's a likelihood of success on the merits, if it's a fundamental right, if there's reason for maybe mistake and not having exhausted, then  then you'd allow a stay and abeyance?
so there are a lot more things than just the delivery. it's not entirely controlled by you.
if i may clarify an important fact and that is clearly the state of texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like setting on the capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge and commemorate certain events. it's important for the court to remember, though, that the state of texas has specifically endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the state seal or the lone star seal for the state of texas on those nine monuments. this monument does not have that kind of endorsement on there.
but how do we  how does smalis fit into this discussion? i thought in smalis in a bench trial, we said it was final.
it is a contingent claim. and you're saying this is the same.
i know, and i say it's hard to figure out when the order was actually written down in the docket.
well, i think that the terms of the suspension clause would be satisfied here because of the exigencies of 9/11. if the question is, am i taking the position that congress consciously thought that it was suspending the writ, then i would say no.
what?
in this preemption provision 
with a  with a blank record  the  the state is going to restrain someone and it may be necessary, it may be not, and if the state has the burden, then why shouldn't a reviewing court speculate on what might have been when the only thing that was  appears of record is he's been convicted and will remain in legirons? the only reason the court gave is that now things have changed. he's no longer in the guilt phase where he enjoys the presumption of innocence. he has been convicted and, therefore, we can keep him in chains. there's nothing situation-specific about it. the judge seems to be saying once a person is convicted, at least of murder, it's fair game. it's  it's permissible to keep him in legirons and shackles.
and that's what we're reviewing here.
when he  when he says, your honor, "it doesn't constitute an excuse in any way."
but i don't think that the court has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a prudential ground, a prudential jurisdictional ground, and nor is there a need for a remand in samuels versus mackell, and in cardinal, for instance. those are cases where the court adopted prudential rules and went ahead and applied them without remand. i  and no remand's necessary. the federal circuit has already looked at this. they 
that's, and that's how 1412 is structured, the provisions about reimbursement. it depends upon the predicate finding that the child was denied a fape and therefore one of the remedies, among other remedies, compensatory education and so forth, is reimbursement.
if the structure is they take the money from you and put it in this elaborate machinery which comes out with statements you're forced to support, the statements that don't have behind them the accountability checks of the federal government, which has to answer to taxpayers and answer to the public for the stuff it puts out  that is  if that's what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it, it remains unconstitutional. it remains unconstitutional because these individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are not  forced to be part of a system in which, even if you have footnotes saying, "this is pursuant to the government," a system in which they will be generally understood in just the way justice breyer said, "well, you know, we assume" 
california is following the standard that we believe batson has identified. now, there are certainly federal courts, such as the ninth circuit, that disagree with that. and so all federal courts do not do what california believes batson allows to be done. the ninth circuit has concluded that california's standard is contrary to and an unreasonable application of batson. that's wade v. terhune, 202 f.3rd.
 his concern with tolbert was a wholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police and 
well, mrs. maples' testimony was not admitted. it was excluded.
but wouldn't you concede that in the case of the injunction in which there is a specific order in relation to a specific respondent, that the police have much less discretion than they would have when there is in effect a general statute saying, respond in these kinds of situations?
no.
 scheduled.
yes. how does the appellate court know whether deference, as required by the rules, was given unless the appellate court can see it? it's such a strange procedure. why, in answer to justice ginsburg, does the government take the view it does? wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?
okay. but then  then the  then there is no significance in the house.
are you free  are you free to abandon it? is the  is the government's surrender of its immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the suit is brought in the federal circuit  is that something that you are free  congress having said that, that the executive is free to say, well, we could take advantage of that, but we don't want to?
thank you, counsel. mr. blanchard, you have a minute remaining.
well, your honor, i can't disagree with what you've said, but  but the 
well, you know 
and then when they decide they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive? that's what your position is?
well, that 
but if  if i may go to the mezei case, what the court said there is that the detention of the alien on ellis island was effectuating his exclusion. the two cannot be distinguished from one another.
i don't know where it's pending. whether it's still pending in the state trial court or in the state appeals court. but nobody denies that it's pending. and i understood your argument to be, whatever mending means there, pending means here because there is no modifier that would limit the same  the same construction.
well, that's fine. and i 
it is.
i can give you one real-world example, justice ginsburg. i represented a defendant in a case that didn't employ 15 people, and when i attempted to convince the plaintiff  plaintiff's lawyer of that fact after the litigation commenced and they weren't willing to  to go ahead and voluntarily dismiss, i simply filed a motion for summary judgment attaching affidavit material, including payroll records. and then once the plaintiff's attorney reviewed that, they voluntarily gave up and the case was dismissed. that would be the way it would normally play out, provided it's not held to be an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. another reason why this should not be a subject matter jurisdiction goes to the practical elements of the way this would progress in litigation and title vii's admonition, which is a rare admonition in legislation, that title vii cases be heard in an  is in an expedited way. in enacting that particular language, it appears to me that congress was acknowledging that this is a very important law. we're trying to remediate a terrible wrong, that is, employment discrimination. so we don't want these cases to languish. it's almost as though it's being processed like a federal rule of civil procedure injunction proceeding, that this is a case that should move very quickly. and many courts, like the one across the river in virginia that are known as so-called rocket dockets, process these cases on a very fast track. i know that  that court does it. other courts that i practice in do it as well where it is not uncommon that from the pleading that a trial is set as quickly as 6 months thereafter. if this was to be subject matter jurisdiction and we had to initially litigate the question of whether or not the person is an employer and putting aside all other issues in the case, it would invariably result in a dragged-out process. in our case, as we  as we noted 
thank you, ms. millett.
did anybody in this case  did any of the defendants in this case request a trial by jury?
well, we  we disagree with that.
i thought there was a criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever school you want. you are allowed to go to a certain choice of school. the criterion was your choice.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i'm looking at the motion that you made, which was not in the first instance for a new trial; it was for a remittitur. this is on page 34(a) of the joint appendix. and you made a motion, in the alternative, for a new trial on antitrust damages, not liability. so, i was really struck by the statement in your brief that you had, indeed, made a motion for a new trial. you made it a motion for a remittitur and, in the alternative, a new trial, limited to damages. you said nothing about a new trial on liability.
but the state of new york can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.
because the critical inquiry is whether the suspect understood that it was his choice and that the police would stop questioning.
no, but the statutory criteria which requires that the jury find by clear and convincing evidence the following factors, which was given to this jury in the fashion that i'm about to tell you, constrains this award and i think properly makes it reasonable. first, you have to consider whether there is a likelihood that serious harm would arise from the defendant's misconduct. second, the degree of the defendant's awareness of that likelihood. three, profitability in the state of oregon. four, duration of the misconduct and concealment of it. five, the attitude and the conduct of the defendant upon discovery of the misconduct. and then finally, financial condition of the defendant, which cuts both ways. it protects a defendant from being bankrupted by punitive damages while at the same time assures that punitive damages are enough to have that deterrent effect. now even after that, the defendant could opt to have the jury address whether they had been previously punished for this misconduct or choose not to, which you would expect most defendants to choose, official and instead post verdict, present that to the trial judge.
right.
well, what we know is that the 
all right. so how was that appropriation money in fact used by the federal government, do you say?
in the tax context, your honor, the  there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to assessments and deficiency notices issued by 
well, wait. does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's position?
well, it's not merely that they are associated with. the very definition, the very identification of lea here is exclusively in terms of per-pupil expenditures or revenues. it's not merely in association. it is a definition, isn't that so?
and this case involves both.
 and the way it was packed 
 we're not operating in uncharted territory here. the rule that the ninth circuit has adopted has been the prevailing rule in the circuits for years. and i just want to clarify something that came up in the last argument, where i cited some very rough statistics about the numbers of cases. there's a rough  a rough cut at the universe of public employee free-speech cases, of which this type of case, where the speech is part of the job, is only a tiny subset. these cases are not dominating the courts, and you don't have all the litigation that is being 
okay.
well, of course, the consequences of the  of the process are significantly different because, obviously, the remedies for  for contempt are significantly more draconian than  than just a finding of a  of a violation. but more  more important than that, justice kennedy 
well, you say they're the co-architects. i mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?
the last phrase in the sequence is "engages in misleading conduct towards another person." that phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page 11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the government's appendix. it's section 1515(a)(3). and it says the term "misleading conduct" means "knowingly making a false statement; intentionally omitting information from a statement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a sample;" and, finally, "knowingly using a trick scheme or device." so, "knowingly" is to be read in as if it were part of section 1512 when it comes to defining the term "engaging in misleading conduct," so you would end up with a statute that congress have, for some reason, drafted that includes the word "knowingly" at the beginning, and then "knowingly" later as the definition of one of the terms that the initial "knowingly" 
but there's a  but there  there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in the colloquy with mr. hungar  one thing is the particularity of pleadings. yes, you have to tell the details of the fraud. no, you don't have to tell the details of the loss. but you do have to have a theory on which you can recover, and if your theory is simply i bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the window. there's no discovery. there's nothing. you have to have, as justice souter pointed out, a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference between  you say it's enough that the stock was selling for much more than it should have, and the other side said, no, that's not enough. you have to show that when the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.
i thought there  there was at least annual review. isn't  wasn't there an annual 
 because 
that's what i was saying. i said that flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule; and the rule is what i suggested.
do you understand that point to be what the ninth circuit relied on?
no, i'm just talking about when i  i don't know if i used the word tablet. i'm just talking about a piece of stone or a 10 poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not 11 covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera. would there be any establishment clause 13 objection simply because though it does not say so, those 14 were quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.
well, to be sure, i know that it wasn't opened and read, but all i'm saying is that what we don't  we don't even know 
justice breyer, justice souter asked before to petitioners' counsel, has there been any evidence of frivolous litigation, tying litigation, brought where there was a valueless patent to which a tie to a requirement was  was made, and petitioners' counsel could name none. the focus here has been on the wrong pool. the arguments are about valueless patents, which there's no evidence they've been used to tie 
in  in thompson, the court in a 4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old  a 15-year-old execution, and the states have taken, including missouri through its general assembly, have taken that to mean that there is a 16-year-old line. and today, in fact, i think it's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard to the 16-year-old line, not because it has some biological or psychological magic, but because perhaps 
can i ask you how far your position extends? i think there's a good argument that if a patent is really a good patent, it doesn't really matter whether the patentee charges a very high royalty or gets a  reduces the royalty and gets profits out of the tied  tied product. in your view, is the rule sound that if it is a monopoly in the tied product, that there is an antitrust problem?
it's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have  wow. this is a standard?
they say one lunch, but not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who gets left out is the person who filed a charge under title vii. that's  a one-at-a-time curiosity the eeoc guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch with all the preferred employees and they leave out the one who filed a title vii charge, that would fit within the eeoc's definition.
the government as i understand it now has a proposed regulation that would align the standards with the two programs. it would bring the nonproliferation  it would bring the standard for the nonproliferation program in line with the new source performance standard.
or a reasonable time, or to place 
so that this state court of appeals chose to be respectful to the ninth circuit to consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a very strong argument.
mr. chief justice, i believe they are joined at the hip because the  the particularity requirement 
what we have before us in this case is  is a case covered by the  the spending clause. so we don't have to grapple with the commerce clause for now.
yes, it was pursuant to injunction, but that was not important to the court's reasoning. what the court said is, "you need not suffer patent damages in order to bring the suit." not a contempt. "you need not breach the injunction and put yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement." it was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and that's the same risk that the petitioner faces here and should not have to bear in order to bring suit. the case or controversy is whether or not the  they owe the royalties. the whole point of the declaratory judgment act was to allow contracting parties not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations in order to get disputes resolved between 
so why should that be different than the first amendment violation?
the, the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant protested his independence, and the jury had found him guilty of false statements.
so that literally, i take it then if someone did have a fence around the house, and i, i  i walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as an attempted burglary under florida law?
the  106(b) was intended for claims that didn't  that did not arise under the bankruptcy code. 106(a) claims, which was the abrogation of sovereign immunity, are claims that arise under the code. 106(b) and 106(c), there is no sovereign immunity to waive. so, 106(b) and 106(c) were designed for the contract claims that justice scalia referred to earlier in the petitioner's argument. and then we looked to the federal  this court's jurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity. and we would most naturally look at the lapides case, in which  in which a state came into this  removed a case from state to federal court, and the court said it didn't matter the type of claim that was being asserted, or that there was affirmative recovery that was being asserted, but, in fact, they constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity. and the state certainly can't say, here, that they didn't know the filing of a proof of claim would constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, because back in 1947, in the gardner versus new jersey case, this court acknowledged that filing a proof of claim constituted a waiver. and there are ways that a state could avoid this. they could have a process by which they had to go through  whether it be the attorney general's office, or whomever  that in order to file a proof of claim, they had to first go somewhere to get authority to do that. and that most naturally happens with corporations, because, as this court is aware in the granfinanciera case, if you  if you assert a proof of claim, you waive your jury-trial right. and that is a large issue for corporations 
it's hard for me to see how the  the defense counsel is in a better position than the prosecutor to show that.
well 
so to that extent 
do you concede that 
am i right in reading your briefs that you don't object to a pre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure itself brought by physicians, for example?
let me ask this 
but that's  that's standard for judgments anyway. when the judgment is final, it means you've gotten through the first  it has preclusive effect. almost always, when a judgment is overturned on appeal, then you go back to state 2 and say, look, it's been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, almost always state 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-judgment relief because what we were relying on as our sister state judgment is no longer on the books. i can't imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the same way.
and what  what is your  what is johnson's mootness argument?
what  what do we do about the  about the fact, which i don't think you  you deny and  and the  the other side points out in both of these cases that, in fact, police departments have their responders to the 911 number intentionally ask a series of questions that gives them all the information they need to conduct a prosecution? in other words, they are using 911 as a  as a prosecutorial device.
 several 
that's exactly right, justice stevens.
was it  was it phrased the same way it is in your brief, in the petition?
okay, but how do we get around the marriage case then?
but there  there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.
there has been no default on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend to keep on running this business, there is reason to suppose that there will not be.
well, i think they did say if a common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement that the manufacturer used a different label than federal law required him to use. in this case, the common law duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer should have put something on 
where  where are you reading from?
isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?
the second option would be the standard that the seventh circuit selected in rodriguez v. chandler, which requires a showing that the second-choice lawyer was deficient in some important qualification or would  pursued a different strategic interest and a different strategic approach than first-choice counsel, and that's it. more analogous to this court's conflicts jurisprudence where, when there is simultaneous multiple representation, it's sufficient for the defendant to show a different strategic approach that was not taken because the conflict caused the  the lawyer not to do that, and there's no requirement of outcome determinativeness that goes along with that. and the third alternative would simply be to provide a harmless error standard, instead of deeming this to be structural error, equating it with a biased judge, total denial of counsel, racial discrimination in the grand jury. this court could provide a standard in which it's the government's burden to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which in cases of overwhelming evidence, the government could establish. and although, i acknowledge, justice souter, that the autonomy interest would be, to a certain extent, lost in that instance, there are many rights, many interests that are sacrificed and not deemed remediable when the error is found harmless.
page 2a of the appendix to the gray brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides that the report of the division  and the tax court is now and has for many years been divided into one-judge divisions. they used to sit en banc or 
i don't think it's circular because i think when congress created the specific cause of action here in (b)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be provided. if respondent's view in this case were accepted, the  the presumption would be exactly flipped, and congress would have had 
i don't know  i don't know whether he was a real estate lawyer or not. (laughter.)
well, in a roundabout way, it does, justice scalia, because what happened was, the ninth circuit was faced with the task, under the federal tort claim act, of deciding whether  if the federal government  the federal mine inspectors, if you would  were private people under like circumstances, would they be liable? so, the ninth circuit was essentially asked a hypothetical question by the federal tort claim, and it was asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of course, that we can set  we can prove no facts which would  which would establish a cause of action. and what the court really did, because the court applied a body of law  the ninth circuit  that began with the louie doctrine  is, the court looked at arizona mine-inspector law as a predictor to what arizona private-person law would be. and from justice roberts' questions about police officers, in the louie case, the state of washington, like the state of arizona, had waived sovereign immunity.
it was  it was cleverly disguised, but it really was a question. (laughter.)
but that's related  that's related to sending people to prevent crime as opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.
it was the right answer.
mr. waxman, do i take it from what you have just said that there is no  even though the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is something strictly for epa to deal with, that the statute has a prohibition on misbranding? i can see the argument that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says no misbranding. so is epa the only the player in the misbranding 
but you're saying 
well, you wouldn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?
well, you  if you conceived the right as one that you made clear there's a violation at the moment the trial court impermissibly denies counsel of choice, and then perhaps to say  and then you went on to say there's either an automatic reversal rule or even a chapman standard, then you could say that there would be a right for mandamus on appeal. but then you run into the same problem of flanagan. and then  but if you didn't do that and he said what the united states 
that is correct.
but has this court ever just said, "fine, we'll hold it in abeyance and come back next term"? i can't recall that we've done that.
in  in general, we have not been allowed to take information outside of the agency. even when we're in the clear 
that's right.
of course, the other thing that was notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text. and there is an argument made i think by professor laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.
no, your honor. the  it was actually not a proceeding, and i'd have to go outside of the record to say this, but if the case was settled, as most cases are, by exchange of telephone calls and whether 
that the preclusive elements are the merits question of the case, not the jurisdictional question.
well, what you're saying is that even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second.
i  it is  we certainly disagree with that with our proposition.
i don't know what you mean by "it's primarily a federal activity," that the federal government polices compliance with the state tax laws?
that's all the facts that are alleged.
okay, all right. i'm just  that's correct.
well, to that degree, your honor, this court has made clear, for example, in the brand x case that even where agencies change positions, where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to chevron deference. we think that that is true in this case.
where  where do you come out on the person running out of the house and yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement officer standing by?
i think probably not, your honor. i think 
 i don't think it's second class. i think what arizona recognized, in the schantz case and in mott, in making this rule in the context of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense, is that if you allow a defendant to argue, "my evidence shows that i lack the capacity to form the requisite mental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens rea case," you can make that argument in terms of any insanity defense you like. i can argue that, "i lack the capacity to form the requisite intent, because i responded to an irresistible impulse." well, a state that's decided to have the m'naghten insanity defense, rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be able to make the judgment, i submit, that, "we're going to have the m'naghten defense, and we're going to keep it as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to allow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively come in through the front door." and, to use justice souter's 
i'm asking why is denial of immunity for sovereign status different from denial of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, etcetera?
so timely 
there  we  we fully concede there need to be an impediment, but what it does not require is the showing that it is impossible for someone to get here. what is a showing is that for most  for the average person in the class, just like the average grand juror in campbell v. louisiana, or the average venire person in powers v. ohio, there are impediments to getting here.
but this court said in both penry i and penry ii that if the trial judge defined deliberateness appropriately, even under the old special issues, that it could solve the problem.
they are present in the court's files. the court said they were present in the court's files. they just said they didn't become part of the plea colloquy because of 
well, probably, justice kennedy. and that is a habeas corpus case that involves exhaustion under the habeas corpus statute. it doesn't involve administrative exhaustion. and, of course, the court abandoned that principle, which was the deliberate bypass exception to the procedural default rule, years ago, i believe in 1977, in favor of the cause and prejudice exception in wainwright versus sykes, which was subsequently codified by congress in aedpa. but there is no administrative exhaustion context, of which we are aware, where untimely exhaustion is sufficient.
justice 
i 
well, then  well, then why isn't  if  if that's so, why isn't it that colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in  in  on an average? you're concerned about the dry years. it seems to me that colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are  are replenished. or am i wrong  am i wrong about that?
i'm certainly not taking  7 advocating the  the defendant's position. i'm 8 advocating the position as follows. suppose it were not a vacatur. suppose it were 10 a dna test, and suppose it were a fact that the dna test 11 identified a different perpetrator of a long-gone state 12 crime and it was definite. now, if no one thought of running that dna test, 14 although they should have, until 4 years after the federal 15 conviction, he's out of luck. he has 1 year from the 16 federal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that 17 year, do everything, including bringing facts into being, 18 such as the result of the dna test, that he had not 19 previously done. and that's consistent with the language. 20 it avoids justice souter's practical problem, and it does 21 not impose an unreasonable burden on the government, i 22 wouldn't think, because he has just a year from 23 conviction.
what is the footnote number?
then it seems to me that you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable inference.
well, would you just clarify something for me as we start to consider the case? i guess this thing went to the jury under an instruction that tried to come to grips with the definition under the statute in some way. was that instruction one to which merck preserved an objection?
 right.
do any of those study the possibilities of the system in which you elect to go into a system where race counts?
here there were 31 days, right?
on the merits of the final judgment in the case, correct, your honor.
there was some cross examination, not a lot. there was cross examination of one of mr. nixon's uncles, who was one of the seven confessions in this case, and we don't know specifically why mr. corin engaged in that cross examination. it could be because that was probably the weakest of the seven confessions and perhaps he wanted the jury to hear that that confession was weak.
it's not clear to me that we have to get into this but if we do, i'm not sure about your answer to justice ginsburg's question. if you have your own logs that you own already and if you have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant logs are the logs that both people are competing for. that's the only relevant market that we are talking about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.
totally independently of the trial strategy 
so how  how does an express warranty claim escape preemption 
the statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party. so presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases. and what we are probably dealing with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their fees.
correct.
what massachusetts law says in  in the zavala case, they said that there is not a right to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence is insufficient. second of all 
that is correct.
the provision of, is it 2107?
 what in fact it thinks.
well, we have 
your honor, the court could certainly, and, more likely, would do what you say. it could also affect the judgment 
that is right. and, of course, in this context, you have a controlling executive act in the form of the regulations themselves that make it clear that the executive views things like conspiracy to violate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of war. now 
if 
the district court could have certified it and  and 
you're right, that's not the issue in the case.
there was no reasonable likelihood that they felt that they could not consider payton's evidence under factor (k), and the california supreme court 
but that's not what this bankruptcy court thought about the claim. this bankruptcy court said some rather critical things.
well, it is the case that the aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what is sometimes called the target crime. it also has to be the case that the principal has to then go on to commit some other crime, a subsequent crime. the issue then arises whether the aider and abettor who intended to assist the target crime is held liable for the subsequent crime.
but you have a subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage lending business that are not associated with national banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the regulation that their competitors are subject to. is that right?
well, apparently florida didn't think so.
we 
we can't give an advisory opinion which would tell you what to do in other cases, which  if that's all it does.
maybe 
well, that's  with respect to  i mean, you can say that of any claim that is valued in dollars. but, i mean, your  you know, what i'm getting at is your position that there is no distinction to be drawn between the contract action and the preferential transfer. and my point was, some transfers might be satisfied  might be sought in what, at least in the traditional classification, would be an in rem, rather than an in personam, action. would your answer be any different if the  if the gold bar were simply sitting on the  on the desk of some state purchasing agent, as opposed to deposited in the  in the state treasury or sold by the state for the monetary value?
it would still be the main office. the  the national bank charter  i think it's called the organization certificate under the terms of the statute  is a historic document that documents where the national bank's initial main office was located. but, of course, a national bank can relocate its main office under 12 u.s.c. 30. and we think that when a national bank relocates its main office, it's the current main office that's controlling.
your honor, we don't read rule 41(b) as allowing any sort of recall authority. rule 41
well, it's a little different here in that in the brooke group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes. so isn't that a reason not to think that we should apply the brooke group test to this situation?
 to the fee payers.
and in beecham v. united states, in justice o'connor's opinion for the court, this court recognized there  it was dealing with another issue, whether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is different from the convicting jurisdiction. it said we don't have any way of knowing whether congress thought about that. that's not the question. congress passed a statute here. it passed a statute that's been written very carefully. it's passed a statute where the definition of the word any in the statute has already been defined. and the  what the statute has been used for is to prosecute exactly the people that congress wanted to capture. it's international gun smugglers 
well, of course, justice scalia, the sixth amendment says all criminal prosecutions 
 on  on contributions, and there would be also a  a mandatory expenditure limit because you could only spend what the government gave you. so that would have all those features. now, if it was, of course, voluntary, it would solve the  the two problems that  that the state talks about because if you have a voluntary public funding system  and this is, again, why remand is  is inappropriate. you don't need to go back and  and determine whether or not the legislature considered providing adequate public funds. i mean, it's whether that alternative exists.
thank you, counsel. mr. brunstad, you have eight minutes remaining.
so that's  that's really not an issue for us.
well, that's actually why i've been looking. i'm bothered by it, because it  if the treaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would mean the religious use of peyote by the native american tribes is exempt, but other people who have identical religions, use identical substances, they're stuck. and that, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the first amendment.
and we could make a determination or the court of appeals could make a determination or the district court could make a determination how likely that would to be affect the result.
whether it's a collateral order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291. it doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.
but it is a different situation, but i think it's more analogous. not only were the  the protests in ariadne directed at the safety conditions on the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the passengers. if i could 
that is not in 
yes. that's correct. and i agree with you that the proper procedure after that would be to bring the issue to the party's attention and let the state decide whether it wanted to file a motion to amend under rule 15; and, if it did so, there are very clear standards that are applied, that were not applied in this case, to decide 
yes. that kind of claim would be timely under section 706. the employer would have an awfully good laches defense.
a meaningful process.
that's right.
i should  i should also 
shouldn't it work out the same?
 understanding.
what's wrong with that here is the question is why is she using that rationale against the young black juror and not the  the young white jurors on the panel? how come she's seeking to achieve the balance by striking juror 16?
but once  once you have the lenient test that you've established, why isn't it enough to say even with that  even with that speculation, a reasonable juror could find? once you have that lenient test, i don't know why you have to exclude the speculation. i mean, there  what if all three of the blacks  it's a case in which the  the visual evidence is significant and all three of the blacks are blind and  and you tell me the judge has to say, oh, no, it  it can't be that  that reason that they were stricken. that doesn't make any sense.
 for me, the case turns on the statute. and it's a hard case. and it seems to me that your answer to justice stevens would be to say that the justice department has found this practice to be an abuse of the drug. but then, my question  and if  if you had, in fact, given that answer, my question  [laughter.]
well 
well, your honor, i don't think so. i mean, prisoners could be released in the state of washington before the terminus of their sentence. they might not  it isn't as though they had to serve all the way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they had. they could easily be 
right? so  so we have a one-way  a one-way altering constitution.
well, because  i mean, and it is an important point, that the statute applies only if it clearly applies by its terms. and it seems to me, the best that petitioners can do is to say that some of the statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous. but that  all that means, as i said, is that, under the strict construction canon, we would prevail. and even if the statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not others, it would not govern these, for the reason i gave earlier, which is that there's no complaint here. we talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a complaint. it's another important point, though, that in order not only  it is  not only does it not begin the proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are only taken about a quarter of the time. and in some limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal, if the assistant secretary issued the order. so 
i think they  i think they date it from the filing of the reply brief because 
 on the other 
oh, well, the court held, in the scott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply at parole revocation hearings. so, if there is an unreasonable search of a parolee that violates the fourth amendment, the evidence could not be admitted at a criminal trial, but it could be admitted at a parole revocation 
there  there was evidence in the swain hearing, and that  in fact, the cross examination by the prosecutors did indicate that practices that were in the past had been  had been vitiated, at least closer to the time of trial. but regardless of that 
it is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on, is it? i mean, i find it hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.
in wiggins. i'm sorry, your honor.
justice souter, i think what  what that terminology was  was referring to was district. the other is meant to modify district. in other words, the first  the first clause there provides a venue where the case can be brought. and if it's not brought in that  if it doesn't fall within that venue, then you can bring it in  in a different district, an other district. i think that's the  the best way to read the  the statute. i mean, otherwise, it could have  as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument, otherwise they could have just had one. they wouldn't need separate clauses. they could have just had one clause that said, and the case  the conspiracy case can be brought in any district where an overt act was committed. petitioners seize on the fact that the venue provision permits venue to be laid in any district in which an overt act was committed. but the rule in conspiracy cases has always been that an overt  that venue can be laid where an overt act was committed regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the offense. at common law, as i said before, conspiracies  a conspiracy conviction did not rely  depend on proof of an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common law where an overt act was committed. the common law venue rule has been applied consistently to modern federal conspiracy statutes, such as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not require proof of an overt act as an element of the offense. congress' codification in the money laundering statute of  of this  of this venue principle cannot be read to presuppose an overt act element when the very venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one. if this court  if this court has no further questions 
yes 
it is a park-like setting. it is the acres of the state capitol grounds. every monument on the state capitol grounds is there because the state legislature wanted to convey a particular message. it is a felony in texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the capitol grounds without the approval of the legislature. most of the monuments are there to honor war veterans. this is the only religious message anywhere on the capitol grounds. and by itself 
if  if you view it as the theft loss, you  you maintain your theory. if you argue, as you were arguing a second ago, i think what, in fact, you're doing is adopting the mere lien theory.
 and said that 
suppose it's the other one that's the critical one.
but that's not how the prosecution presented it to the jury.
it's not going to help to say incumbents had a bigger advantage before. that is, the question is, what we're interested in is  at least what i've written that i'm interested in, is at what point do these become so low that they really, as a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a challenge. and from that point of view, your numbers, which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive district, and your numbers, which do not explain all the problems that judge winter had with these things, do not help. that's why i'm asking you the question.
but i  i thought that you 5 conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim 6 is the vacatur. i  i thought that you opened up with 7 that. and it  it 
but you said  in response to justice kennedy's question, you said that there was nothing, i think, as you put it, in the exiting of the water that was significantly different that  or that we could peg as significantly different. but that seems to me to be at odds with your answer to the chief justice's question about the barrel, because the exiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of the water from the dam are exactly the same. and if one is a discharge, i don't see why the other isn't a discharge.
well, your honor makes a distinction between a post-aedpa case and pre-aedpa cases. in a post-aedpa setting, it is  the circuit court of appeals is looking at its own post-aedpa case  post a-e-d-p-a, aedpa case which has said that this set of facts constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established law. we don't disagree that stare decisis might come into play there. it doesn't mean that that first decision was correct, but we don't  what happened here in contrast was a pre-aedpa decision that was used to define the clearly established law of this court, give it more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside of it.
and that's the probable cause you're relying on.
the case is submitted.
yes, but in that case it was overseeing arrangements that were made by our government, not  they didn't have that much local authority.
i mean, why 
let's focus 
well, that's because the defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come forward with it.
no. it's  it's not hard to do.
we  well, they are minimums, your honor. we submit these to the epa. the epa approves the state water quality standards, and then those standards are how we evaluate these federally licensed activities as to whether they're in compliance or not. and they determine the certification, whether it's issued, and if it's issued, with what conditions. if a state  if a state's rivers were not conducive to hydropower  the question you asked, your honor was  justice souter  could a state prevent hydropower from occurring? again, we have, with respect to a few rivers in the state of maine; but most of the rivers, it is a designated use, because states, like the federal government, value hydropower. there is no air pollution. it's a clean source of energy. we value it. and, indeed, the antidegradation policies that are part of our water quality standards require us to look at the impact on petitioner's dams, the power output that's going to be  going to  is going to result from these various conditions that we impose as a part of our certification.
well, did you challenge the sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did not allege that the  the program was not based on  was based on factors that were unreasonable?
justice  justice scalia, there's no doubt  and the jury was instructed  that age is a mitigating factor although, justice kennedy, in response to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the time. but the fact that he could have made an individualized mitigating case or argued that he was only  that he was young, as he did, doesn't address the constitutional problem. the constitutional problem is that overwhelmingly 16- and 17-year-olds, for reasons of the  the developmental reasons relating to their psychosocial character 
 motion to vacate, you have 30 days to appeal.
i think that's correct. again, four reasons why title ii is not congruent with the  with the requirements of the constitution. first, as in garrett, the substantive accommodation duty imposed by title ii far exceeds the requirements of the constitution. and to see why, we need look no further than mr. goodman's complaints that are in the joint appendix, the government's addendum c, and the justice department's implementing regulations, which are found at 28 c.f.r. section 35.130(b). and if you  if you look at mr. goodman's complaint, yes, there are some allegations there that obviously raise constitutional issues, but there are a lot of allegations that clearly state a claim under the justice department's interpretation of title ii, but, equally clearly, don't raise constitutional issues. for example, on page 65, he has a claim seeking to make the tv lounge and other entertainment facilities wheelchair accessible. pages 53, 57, and 82, he makes a claim for better access to recreation facilities, rehabilitative exercises, and physical therapy. at page 64 of the joint appendix, he makes a claim to force the state to install wheelchair-accessible bathrooms.
there was 
no, your honor. those were cases where there were motions to dismiss based upon lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
 time to correct me, if i am.
so this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.
it alters, it modifies the manner in which we implement that right. under ohio versus roberts there was plenty of cross-examination that was occurring. the standard under ohio versus roberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of reliability. there was a reliability screen in place, and it was clear under ohio versus roberts that the right to confrontation was an essential bedrock right, essential to a fair trial.
 our principal position would be the same. and i  and i think that that approach is consistent with justice o'connor's opinion in smith, which got a lot of prominence in the subsequent debate about rfra, because, in that  in that opinion, even though the compelling-interest test was applied, justice o'connor concluded that that test was satisfied because 
because you can imagine as a juror  jurors are very attentive during trials  that they look out into the audience and see in the jury box  i mean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing buttons. what are those buttons? what's on there? what's the point of  there's a degree of scrutiny that's naturally going to occur by an attentive juror. that's really the issue.
i think that's correct, justice stevens, but 
you don't want to put your  hang your hat on the "contrary to" prong, though, do you? your argument, i thought, was an unreasonable application argument.
what is that fact?
thank you, mr. marcus. ms. samek, you have about 3 and a half minutes left.
he could  he could not go into a federal court with a federal question? he would have to go to the initial decision maker, then the i 
i  i think, your honor, that the trial judge found that  that there simply wasn't a dispute about that, that  that the  that there wasn't enough. and so it was fine to look at the state's case. and i would urge the court 
that's 
he  he doesn't have a right to be released. but  but you do not contend that we could kill him.
mr. moran, how  how long do you think the officers had to wait before they could have entered?
but you're saying those convictions are more than  more than 23 years old?
no. i'm  i'm just trying to characterize your answer to me. you said, yes, that would be an injunction and it would be an injunction typical of what courts of equity issue.
of course, they have unfettered discretion with respect to the mitigating factors, don't they? under 
i 
it seems  it seems if you read a provision like this, it says what the united states would be required to prove. implicit in  in that is in any action brought by the united states under 3730. i think  think (c) is clearly talking about cases in which the united states is bringing the action.
where? where should i look on that?
what would you do with justice alito's question? dean milk versus madison: all milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of where it's 
 rather than the state 
the  the treaty provision then governs only in the sense that for remedy it refers you to domestic law. is that it?
mr. lange, you were appointed by the court, and on behalf of the court, i want to thank you for your services and for the quality of your services.
such as in crawford, but in crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the court said, materials such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial statements. similar pretrial statement is not an agitated woman calling 911 or telling a police officer who  as in your case, who comes in response to a call, there's a disturbance going on in that house, get there.
isn't it true, just to get one thought out on the table, that there are factors that the guidelines don't  did not consider, such as military service?
justice scalia, i think it is  it is default for a life sentence. and i believe it is certainly an acknowledgement that what really happens here is a juror steps back, after the consideration of all the evidence that this court requires under the eighth amendment, and decides what they can live with: a sentence of death or a sentence of life. and one juror who has doubt can extend mercy. and, mr. chief justice, if it may please the court, i'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
 the government 
well, it is true but is not necessarily the case that being aware of a natural phenomenon or of a correlation leads you inevitably to an inventive diagnostic test. there is a correlation between being tall and being  you know, between height and weight. if i tell you that somebody's coming to visit you who is 250 pounds, that person is probably not a five year-old. but that gets me nowhere in terms of turning that into useful knowledge that could be patentable.
may i 
so i don't find anything ambiguous in what you describe.
 in the same 
why doesn't that  why isn't that required to be  to be made public?
suppose that they had beat him up two or three times. the first time it didn't relate to it, but then they took him into the interrogation room and they beat him up again. what about that case?
the dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in brecht. they said that kotteakos would apply even where the state court has found that "no violation has occurred."
 in aetna.
all right, then 
well 
you're not suggesting he was incompetent during that period as well.
certainly. and their 
that isn't the only 
so your point is in the past, they didn't give them the information.
i think it depends on how you define deadly force. of course, there can be different 
yes.
mr. kise, this may be important. do you agree with mr. rashkind that in the florida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was not on the florida statute of limitations 
no. the  the argument is that he thinks he does have a ground. it turns out that he's wrong. unless he is very unimaginative, he'll find another one. it's not that he arrests saying i have no basis to arrest this person, but i'll think of something later. it's  it's the  the problem is, i think  or the argument, i think, is directed to a case like this.
it was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury.
maybe, mr. olson, you could give us an example where the rule of reason would find a violation in this situation?
okay.
do you think it was properly stated in that instruction?
 and the 
yes.
i thought the problem was disparity in school districts. since much of the funding for education is local funding, in some places there are very rich school districts and very, very poor, poor school districts. and i thought that the purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to district. it makes perfect sense, it seems to me.
 rule that would sort of encourage people to go public rather than 
did you raise this issue below?
in a time horizon longer or shorter than the 25-year time horizon that was discussed in grutter?
we say the same about the first amendment, don't we? all government actions restricting speech are subject to strict scrutiny. right? and yet, we allow that to occur in prison.
i thought you said 14.
mr. zelenka, do you agree that all 49 other states do not look at the  at the weight of the prosecution's case when making this decision?
yes.
even if 
i don't know how much help i can get or not but i was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the ten commandments alone? yes, of course it is. now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot. not everybody will go with the ten commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. this is going too far. why? because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. now, suppose i go down that track because what i'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not. but for present purposes, let's assume it's too far. now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal. now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it wrong to end with?
 to suspend the writ.
but 
 would be substantial disruption.
absolutely not. it would be bad enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50 states and had each 
right.
absolutely. they're looking to assert a claim. i don't have a claim for medical benefits in the underlying court 
why?
well, in any event, we have a 
i believe, again, your honor, i believe that it depends on how broad the test is. the model penal code test, which most of the circuit courts 
well, can you  can you do that under a general contract theory?
and is that a  is there any issue about that here?
so, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? if you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?
at which point does he get  at which point does he get access?
okay. where would i be wrong?
 navigable water.
thank you. the case is submitted.
the other possibilities are that the jury has found that, "we can't decide whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa. and the statute tells  the instructions tell us to impose death."
it has a 10-year bar. but the earlier 1991 act says, "that doesn't apply to us."
that's because the mitigation case hasn't been made.
the other  the other harm is there any evidence of because it's  it would also be harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite difficult decisions, because the  the antenna  they bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. they're environmentally harmful. they  there are a lot of bad things, as well as good things about them. and of course, it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning boards were erring too much on the side of granting everybody's application, as well as too much on the side of not granting them.
that's not 
yes, your honor. i would say that it would be an abuse.
well, justice stevens, i mean, i  first of all, i would say, as it compared to raich, i would almost think this is an a fortiori case, as it affects commerce, because, unlike raich, which, of course, were untraditional noncommercial transactions, the transactions at issue here are standard commercial transactions that are 
now, also 
so if there are some cases when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not, why should you say it's always irreparable injury?
but 
my problem with your argument is steiner.
yes. it was on state collateral review, your honor.
well, i'm sure it does, but  but it's  it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age i get a tax benefit, i'm receiving the money on account of my age. that doesn't make any sense to me.
i  i know that, but does it say you're being reconsidered for  considered for reclassification because you hit somebody over the head or because you've shown that you're a member of a gang or some other reason?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
absolutely falls within (a).
may i ask if you believe the supervision after the 90-day period covered in subparagraph 3  is there  can that continue indefinitely in your view?
are you  are you saying that what we have before us is this, a trial which showed that the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial judge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new policies as remedies for past wrongs that were established? and the question is the adequacy of that remedy. that's one way to look at the case.
and 
well 
is  is that true with respect to weight and mustaches and things like that?
yes.
oh 
the joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft. (laughter.)
mr. chief justice, we're not saying that this power is plenary. it is an abuse of discretion standard. there would have to be a reason for doing so. if the court sua sponte decided it had reached the wrong result and wished to reconsider it, i don't think there's anything in rule 41(b) that would forbid it. that does occasionally happen in en banc cases, and those are salutary appellate practices. if, for an example, there's a national security case or some other case and the court of appeals resolves it and denies an en banc petition without prejudice, thinking that it's an important enough case that it should come immediately to this court, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the court of appeals reconsidering en banc the decision if this court denies review. those are the kinds of circumstances that  that happen that are good appellate practices 
no, no, but how many, how many times do they  let me call it impaneling the jury twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.
and is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?
 the degree 
are the opinions a page or two or just a sentence or two? what is typical?
no, but what  it seems to me that what judge sneed's theory boils down to is this. you cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by the fraud in question. in theory, that limit is established by the inflation at the time you purchase. so that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow from that that you have anything to recover for until you have your actual loss if you're pleading a  a fraud-on-the-market theory. isn't that fair to say?
i see.
the answer to that, your honor, is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds, they do not rely on lack of information, they did not rely on background principles of administrative law. what though said here is  and  that they did not, in fact, contest the seriousness of the problem. but note, in two back to back sentences on page a-82 of the third petition they say: we must address the, issue but we disagree with the regulatory approach. the very section in which they explained why they weren't going to regulate is entitled "different policy approach." rejecting mandatory motor vehicle regulation as a bad idea is simply not a policy choice that congress left to epa.
yes, that's 
i think, with respect, justice scalia, i'm not  i think that there is an interesting question about  with respect to death, whether what they are and what they will become is totally irrelevant. but accepting the premise of your question, my point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively know, which is that when the jury gets around to evaluating what the character was that manifested that horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of age and because of a number of confounding factors and because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or 2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.
what you  what you mean when you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can take them to guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push them out?
it would cover late deliveries.
 and 
what is your proposed rule? you haven't said yet.
well, the  it  i'd ask 
and why  and why should we not credit the finding of fact by the  by the trial judge 
the other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.
well, the remedies that have been allowed by the courts, your honor  and we believe, in the absence of any appropriate waiver  but the actions that have been allowed have been allowed against irs officials, and congress did expressly replace those, on 12a, in 7426(d): "no action may be maintained against any officer or employee of the united states."
based on equitable principles, i think that would be the interpretation, yes, your honor.
i'm sorry?
but what are the standards they use? where  where do i look to find out what standards they use, if i get there?
isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to 
i was beginning to think that, too. [laughter.]
you  you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.
where  where is the unomitted language? what  what page of the brief are you quoting from?
that was repealed.
i also haven't mentioned the explicit provision, that one of the other justices mentioned earlier  i think, the chief justice  that the penultimate sentence of 1101(a)(43) says that something  a  an offense constitutes an aggravated felony, whether in violation of federal or state laws.
that is a civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction. so i've sued you. you have an insurer who's going  who  who lives in the same state i live.
 is the right to possess.
 such  such an obvious violation of your right to confront your accuser, and just because it was presented to the police without  without an initial interrogation by the police, i don't think that would have made any difference at common law.
and any  any court, i mean, in  in theory, can  can revise its own  its own opinions. but the  i mean, we look to preclusion really on  on the effect of the judgment in another court, and i take it they have not ruled on that.
do you think that was proper or improper?
okay, then it does not have 
and i suppose it's entirely possible that if the judge then decided it is really  if we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge could say, well, okay, even under 1983 the state has the defense of laches and you still lose. i mean, you  we don't know what's going to happen if we find out  if we agree with what your argument in this court is. is that right?
it is?
do you think there's a official realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted, so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised release?
why not?
well, i'm  i'm just not sure that's the case. we're asking about 403. in order to completely exclude and prescind, in justice scalia's word, that the  the nature of the prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.
but why wouldn't it have information about effectiveness on animals? i mean, if the  you show that the  all the fda's interested in is that it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was effective to cure the tumor?
right.
well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what california law is.
no.
what articles would be 
it's the former.
that's right, but when  when the bar applies, it's  it's an absolute bar. i don't  i agree that if the bar has been triggered, it is a  it completely precludes any further action on any claims, but i don't think the word complete gives us much guidance about when the bar is triggered. and the purpose behind the bar generally is not the same as the purpose of qualified immunity because although the ftca, in general, and the legislative history of the ftca indicates that the act as a whole was intended to protect employee morale and distraction from employment, that's not the purpose behind the judgment bar. and the judgment bar would be a poor vehicle for accomplishing that purpose since it allows not only a bivens suit as an initial matter and, when it was enacted, allowed  still allowed employees to be sued for state torts, but also would allow two suits, as long as the bivens suit were litigated before.
i don't think there is a factual question like that because i don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the ninth circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. there  there was never an argument made to the jury that this  that this extended beyond the  the period of the end of the search. the argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have  should have been limited to the room where the suspect was  was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the  before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. and then they were arguing that  that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. but they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a fourth amendment violation in its own right.
not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that. but he was gone.
thank you, mr. haglund. mr. pincus, you have two minutes remaining.
so  so we know  they  they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.
thank you, mr. prendergast.
well, at the point where the government charges more than the taxpayer received 
and i would respectfully disagree, your honor, because i don't see how it can be final for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes of the statute.
that was a statute, and the court relied on that for why the statute was constitutional. even in greenholtz, the parole case, the  this court said over and over again that in the  in the parole decision, which is much more predictive than here, the parole board gave its reasons for why it 
because 
 had to carry this message. now, here you want us to think of some cowboy 
it's certainly not foreclosed by this court's precedent, and it's an open question where the policies  how they would weigh out. there's no language in this license, however, suggesting any type of settlement. and, moreover, i think it's important to recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete dispute about what the licensing agreement means. count one in the complaint is asking for a declaration 
thank you, mr. alioto.
that's true, they did not do that here and i'm not suggesting that they did, only that, uniquely among the rules that this court has established in the antitrust area, this rule has received the repeated attention of congress; and so the court's deference to congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules. and third, price is different. this court has said that price competition is the central nervous system of the economy. other restraints, to be sure, might indirectly affect price, but not with the same absolute force. territorial restraints don't absolutely prevent price competition because customers can travel or order by phone, mail, or internet, and indeed under territorial restraints there are often multiple retailers in a particular territory who can compete. maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at all unless, as the court noted in khan, it's really minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which case the court in khan said it's illegal. manufacturers can of course pay retailers for the services that enhance the product that are being advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price maintenance. but the question for this court is whether the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing agreement to make that payment to buy those services, and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide in a rule of reason trial. that's a question of statutory interpretation for this court. it's a question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer can use to buy those retailer services. it's also true that the claim that price-fixing works to induce those services is both debatable and untested. the retailers have no obligations to provide services under the retail price maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other cases.
well 
the information on the disk is of no use to the computer unless it's made into a physical machine readable document  object.
and, justice scalia, that's not, 23 however, the issue before the court. what this prosecutor 24 told the jury is this man learned a lesson that when he 25 commits his repeated crimes, he shouldn't leave any 1 witnesses behind.
are you going to get to the point of whether there was, indeed, an opportunity for this defendant to introduce evidence about inadequate performance of counsel?
the backup argument that you're now making, that not your principal argument.
well, i think the plaintiff could argue that, "that's not my core job duties. my job duties is to"  if it's a prosecutor, "is to make statements" 
well, you've cited the solicitor general's brief 
exactly.
what would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? the parole commission was  was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. would that be 1983 or habeas?
it's a spectrum. and i would  i'm not conceding that the example necessarily requires habeas relief, because there are a whole host of circumstances that we wouldn't know about it, for instance, whether it was ever seen, in cases that people don't see the button, or what have you.
if you lose this case, can the defendant be prosecuted federally under the carjacking statute?
so, that's 
so can every defendant have leg braces in every case?
because there has to be two things. there has to be a statute. and then there has to be an allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybody  than any other citizen. and if you have a situation like your hypothetical statue, where you don't have any spending that goes outside of the government, then you might have an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent. because if there's a problem with what's going 
well, that's  you see, justice ginsburg answered that. i  i mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that  that the second person says, you know, judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.
but 
so, it does go to his presumably objectively reasonable views of what nature of privacy he has.
you could answer it that, look at what this person did. you look at his crime. we have the death penalty in this state. in some cases it's appropriate. it's appropriate in this case. it's not appropriate to say: i'm the prosecutor, i decide in which cases we seek death.
but it didn't include social security payments when it was enacted.
but if  if i may interrupt you  if it's getting passed through, and they're still selling their gas, then there's no  then the tribe cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing authority is being compromised or threatened. and the argument, basically, would boil down to the argument that they want to make a bigger profit.
the only issue in that case is competent performance, and it seems to me that the  the difficulty behind a number of our questions this morning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from  from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy interest to a counsel issue that does involve an autonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as self-representation, but as  as everybody agrees, as you've said, it involves some autonomy interest. and if we're going to import the rule of prejudice from non-autonomy cases as the  as the necessary condition in autonomy cases, then it seems to me the autonomy interest is devalued to the point of almost of disappearance. it becomes not much more than  a little bit, but not much more than an ineffective assistance case.
they instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is.
i 
but only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily  and this is the crucial language  invalidate the criminal conviction.
no, we don't.
justice o'connor, i agree completely with the special master. the state of colorado has proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate in that. to the extent there  there have been past conflicts, colorado has said let's get them behind us. let's return to the compact, congressionally sanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's proceed down the road. we will 
we're not saying that, your honor. we're saying that they have, they certainly have to do more than they have done here. and they're granted their standing 
yes, justice stevens. i think the officer had very limited options, two options at that point: either use force or let mr. harris go. and i think it was a balancing of 
even first amendment rights.
but  but in that case, there was  as i understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing object and the ship in the united states. so it at least made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed to external relationships arguably involving  or implicating american law. you've got exactly the opposite situation here. you've got contracts made in the united states with the foreign cruise line. you didn't have that in your patent case.
it doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties. they have  it says they have the right to  for an impartial due process hearing. i would suppose if you're trying to figure out who is the party to that case, you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents.
so can  every fcc regulation can be enforceable by private action? all the fcc has to say is that violation of this regulation is unjust.
if the test was not ordered for the purpose of diagnosing 
well, first of all, that  that is not  not true. the record reflects that the 
where the government hasn't appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.
but, it  but it was asked by the  by the pre-verdict motion. what  the only thing that wasn't done is, it  the request wasn't repeated after the verdict. i can see your point if there had never been a motion for directed verdict at the close of all of the evidence. but there was that. and so, all that we're missing is a repetition of the same words after the jury comes in.
 as it could be.
yes, but i'm assuming that  that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as it would have. but on the point of disclosure, there is a difference between your position and the government's, and i really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or it's my misperception. your view is there's the disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops. in the government's presentation  and i'm reading from page 19  the fraud can be revealed by means other than a corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may not be a necessary condition for establishing loss causation in every fraud on the marketplace.
thank you, mr. salmons.
because of the text of the act or because of some policy that the attorney general would follow in order just to decline to prosecute? we want to know what this act says in the instance posed by justice souter.
it has to regulate even if it concludes that regulation would make things worse?
 requirement.
 of the government's appendix 
thank you, mr. deixler. the case is submitted.
yes, i am.
well, there has to be some indication 
well, congress has  has, by definition, treated those people as inadmissible aliens who are subject to removal proceedings. and the interdiction methods are  they're purely political decisions that the government needs to make.
yes, he  yes, he did, your honor, and having grown up as the son of diplomats, he was obviously familiar with diplomats and their behavior in social settings. and it was his feeling and his strategic view that his client was better off not raising and not contacting the consulate. but, again, this goes back to the basic point that justice kennedy raised earlier. in america, we give all criminal defendants, regardless of nationality, a lawyer to represent them. we charge that lawyer with knowing their rights and with vindicating their rights, with making the objections necessary to vindicate miranda rights, with making the necessary objections with respect to the fourth amendment. the vienna convention should be no different. if this treaty does, in fact, create judicially enforceable individual rights, then the attorneys who are appointed or to represent these people will know about that and will be responsible for vindicating. that's how we do things in the american system.
yes. no. forget the  yes. every day of the week, they come in. is that right? present sense impressions. it's here as the first exception to the hearsay rule.
may i ask just  did the individual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time before the settlement of the corporate claim?
how soon after his physical arrest does he have a right to appear before the magistrate?
they won't arrest someone for several charges?
not if you had your way.
 on that in california? wouldn't you have an action in the state if somebody goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and so forth?
let's just imagine a real circumstance. a 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the morning on saturday into the emergency room and the doctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this very high blood pressure, whatever. and the doctor thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child. if i don't, i don't think she's going to die but she'll never have children. and he's thinking that. what's supposed to happen? he calls up pam pevagoglio or pam livingston and there is no answer. it's 2:00 in the morning and there is one of those things, leave a message, okay? should i call your parents? no. they don't know i'm pregnant. now, what's supposed to happen?
you said there's no disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions. but dogs can be frightening, humiliating. it seems to me that there is some association with the idea that i have a right to be let alone by my government and having a large dog circle my car.
not in the first year.
so 
that they received everything they 7 needed to challenge the aggravation case through 8 discovery. and there's a little bit 
well 
no, the lower courts  the most usual interpretation of tiller that we've cited in our brief that the lower courts perform is this idea of any events leading up to the ultimate injury 
the  your honor, that's correct. i think that the district court also acknowledged, though, that the parents probably were interested in sending their child to private school. i think, either way, we're not suggesting that the record in this case requires the court to take one result or another on the fundamental question of who bears the burden of proof. we think that the complaining party bears the burden of proof. that's the rule 
 everybody else who doesn't want to go just avoids it. so that they don't have to do anything. they just have to 
but even  even if i agreed with that, i'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is  is an overwhelming demonstration of  of the new common law.
none at all.
of course, that means they comply with lockett. i want to ask you one question that goes back to your colloquy with justice souter and justice scalia. justice scalia pointed out that the state has made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed with. and that was true in the cases back in 1975 and 6. there were some state statutes that mandated death based on the moral judgment of the state in certain circumstances. i think one was a north carolina statute. do you ask us to reexamine those cases?
well 
but the point is, we criticized the panel decision in welch, which did exactly what this panel did here.
but at least this case involves no such concern about habeas.
well, it  it seems to me that what works in your favor is  is it swancc? i don't  i'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case.
in  in this case, your honor, there was no connection at all. in this case, there was no connection identified. it was speculated that there might be a potential 
that's correct, and that's what the sixth circuit 
again, the respondents in this case have not conceded constitutional error, and in their brief they repeat that. and i think there's a question whether a court should 
that doesn't  and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which i think is misplaced in this context.
 regulatory scheme.
it's a question of waiver, part of it. i mean, that's  it's well established that, i guess, i mean, if a state waives an adequate state ground by considering the federal issue, the federal courts will go into the federal ground and they can't later, can they  is there any case you found anywhere  i haven't found one  where say any federal court considered a state case where the state went into the federal issue, the state had said nothing about a state ground, and then after the federal court's decided it somehow the state got a hold of it again and they this time said, oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the state ground here. and is there any case that you found like that which says that was permissible?
well 
it is, but it's changing the corporate structure in a fundamentally important way. that's that it's no owned and controlled by a federally chartered national bank.
no, i think this court has held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate means that is used. but what we are arguing is that here you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my co-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate means. it is not inappropriate under the dormant commerce clause for the government to step in and take over provision of a service. petitioners themselves agree that, in fact, the government could take over waste management services from soup to nuts. they suggest that there is some difference of a constitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is contracted out to the private market, and would argue that actually turns the dominant commerce clause on its head. one final point, if i could make. several of you asked about whether or not there are other mechanisms that the localities could use to further these goals, goals which are set forth in both federal and state laws. first of all, under the pike test, there is no least restrictive alternative test. so it is not required that the localities demonstrate that there is no other option that might meet these goals. the second circuit concluded and rightly so i think on page 20a of the appendix to the petition that there was no other option that presented itself in the record that the counties could address, or could use to address their liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a very wide range of products.
well, at that point the oneidas 
no, but neither 
well, that  that may be on your argument that noise is never sufficient to dispense with a warrant requirement. but it seems to me that in  in the reasonableness analysis that the trial court was going through, the trial court was saying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a reasonable entry without a knock. and  and i take it you  you accept that and you think the trial court was correct, that there is no futility exception.
so i take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't? is that what it said?
certainly.
well, in fact, the  it refers to "administrative proceedings required by contract or law." and that clause applies in the particular circumstance where a law or a contract requires some sort of administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the action for money damages. so, if you can bring your official money-damages action without any prior administrative proceeding, regardless of where you bring 
thank you, mr. fisher. the case is submitted.
tell me if i'm right.
 be "corrupt."
the students' present at the event, presence as the event, was like an assembly. students may go into an assembly hall and not have to sit with their class. they were released from class, but they were not released from school or school supervision. there were teachers around there and the school could define what is the nature of our assembly at this public event and, just as in, in the auditorium a school could say there will be no political banners or, frankly, no banners about anything other than what the event is 
so if you agree we're talking about. what is the toll on the states, it seems to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer, if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook affected?
 with a treaty is not necessarily a compelling state interest.
that's why i think there would, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for the court to articulate a rule that had to do with encouraging illegal conduct and particularly 
has justice breyer conducted the kind of investigation he asked you about? (laughter.)
what 
my law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly. one is called wilwerding v. swenson and the other johnson v. avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even. now, so there are  there are two cases that, if she's right  and she's usually right  that  that  where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions. so i've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.
that is correct.
oh, no. to be sure, no 
mr. salmons.
so that is the question. i mean, the question is open whether there 
that's incorrect. i mean, most of the circuits have addressed this question, and virtually all of them are  have sided with the ninth circuit and has  have refused to draw a bright-line rule when speech has come up as part of the job. and the  and as  justice scalia, you seem to be referring to the "as a citizen" phrase the court has used in its opinions. and i want to address that. no decision by this court has ever turned on the "as a citizen" phrase, and it's always been used in conjunction with "matter of public concern." the most that can be said is the phrase characterizes the facts of the cases in which the court used it. the court hasn't addressed whether speech that's part of the job 
to vacate the sentence, yes, your honor.
well, either way.
when 
and is it not true that the definition that your opponent asks for is the same definition that would apply in tort litigation in california and in most states of the country?
but  but judge giles didn't understand it either.
surely it could prohibit discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in 1938.
well, the realities out there are they built a wall. they put in all of these procedural protections and they said no discovery until you climb the wall. now what kind of a wall was it? was it a dutch dike or the berlin wall? if you look at that statute, contrary to what mr. phillips urges, there are multiple policies expressed in that statute, one of which is, private cases are good. let's just get the right people to run those private cases. let's control them. let's, let's have a greater threshold, but let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. because everybody seems to agree private cases help.
he said  he  he almost made it aggravating. isn't that scary? i don't have the  i don't have the full argument.
because the government 
because i got the impression, from your motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, that you did not. but i don't see anything unequivocally establishing that in the record.
there are big lenders in the united states and those people don't fool around. they get opinions. and they lend money to puerto rico or they lend money to some of these places. they're going to have opinion letters. and those opinion letters are going to say whether they think in their opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not. and of course, i would think those opinion letters would say for puerto rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation mean. they might or might not. in other words, i'm trying to find ways of getting the tax.
well, that's true, justice ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle. when we briefed the case, there was no delaware judgment. and it was only on the eve of oral argument 
and  and what  what is the theory on which the statutes are  are adopted?
but, justice kennedy and justice stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere. it's been on the books for a long time and there was a legislative 
your honor, i believe mincey itself requires the  the seriousness of the offense be evaluated, and further 
well, but your point, though  i mean, someone illegally reentering at that time might not have had a reasonable expectation of the availability of discretionary relief. on the other hand, someone in the  a petitioner's position, after all that had happened, did have a fairly good case under those provisions that were no longer available.
if the court is referring to rule 15(c)(2), our argument is that rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule of automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil cases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of automatic relation back in habeas cases.
may i ask, mr. kirkpatrick? in arkansas, is the tax  tax delinquency a matter of public record so a prospective purchaser would find it by making a title search?
i mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole. i  i don't see how you make sense out of that 180 
well, it makes me suspect that davis was wrong.
well, that's correct, your honor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule that 
the claim, yes, that's right.
in other words, if a state were to say, "our water quality standard is the following. we never build a dam in our state, no matter what." okay? now, there's no authority in the epa to set that aside as it not being a proper clean water act standard.
could the court appoint the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed as guardian ad litem?
speech 
i think the reason is that 
but not must.
yes. with respect to the sales 
justice stevens and scalia, i would rely on the trial judge to make a determination of the intention of the district attorney 
no. i  i think it's just a federal common law question here, and it's only as good as the reasoning that underlies it. but when you start to see a uniform body or a consensus of opinion on one side of the equation, then there  it's much more likely that there are certain reasons that are underlying that justify it.
that's right.
that's essentially the picture, justice ginsburg, in brewer. that's exactly the way counsel presented it to the jury. but not only did counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous despite his childhood shortcomings, there was a deliberateness definition submitted in the brewer case, which is what this court suggested in penry in 1989 might remedy this problem. and so the court submitted a definition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to the jury, that  the definition was read to the jury, counsel argued 
okay. but what interest does it serve not to have some rules, manuals, regulations that help make sure it really is random, or help make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure that it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve with the suspicionless searches?
well, the reason that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures. this additional period is when it's pending, not before the state but before a federal court.
are we back to the original version, which i'll read what it says. it says: "with a few specific exceptions  race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socioeconomic state  with those exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case." that's what it said. a part of the guidelines in the heartland. if it's not the heartland, depart. now, what i wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out, before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its  the judge could do that.
what about virginia bankshares?
i believe that's correct, your honor. but the point i was making 
sure.
no, justice o'connor, i don't believe that there needs to be any change in the posture of the case in order  in order for the court to address the federal issue, and that's because the significance of the oregon supreme court ruling doesn't turn on whether someone's testimony was admitted in the guilt phase, or not.
all right. so you're saying we'll do it some, just be careful about it?
i suppose there can always be a specific objection to the reasonable availability of a particular remedy. i mean, if this  the prison remedy is, you know, within 5 minutes you've got to file a complaint or something. but that's not the question here. the question here is what the plra requires, as a general matter, with respect to prison remedies.
it's insufficient, your honor, because it doesn't change the underlying fact that the request itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the request is, the request itself gets treated differently and better merely because it's religious. this is a 
the case is submitted.
well, i don't know that we've  i don't know of any case where this court has held otherwise.
tell me again, just to be sure i have it my  tell me very briefly, what it is that makes this invention nonobvious?
and, justice ginsburg, if judge hermansdorfer had said, i'm much too busy and therefore i lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable that the thermtron case would have been decided any differently. congress understands the difference between jurisdiction and merits. this court understands the difference between jurisdiction and merits. judge easterbrook certainly understood that distinction. this determination made by the district court here was a merits determination not controlled by 1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by 1447(d).
well, justice kennedy, in mississippi, we have, there again, that open standard, not the federal standard. and we would give him that instruction and give that jury that option if the facts support it, and i respectfully submit to the court that  that the facts do not support a lesser-included offense under these facts. if the court has no further questions, thank you.
i suspect, your honor, that the government would urge such a rule if it were at issue in case.
i take it that is not an issue before us?
why is that? i don't understand why the sec could not  they can make rules for a single ipo; it seems to me they can make rules for coordination of ipo. why can't they do that?
 and closure.
i think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you  and  and the jury determined that there  that it was unreasonable, then i think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact  that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. i do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. but  but i agree. i mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. but on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this court has already decided that in the fourth amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.
even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer  that the  the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that won't go along? those two are substitute of each other. colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have to do it on your own, and then you have to do the draconian thing of terminating the dealer.
but, your argument, i take it, would be the same if the proportions were reversed. your argument with respect to  your current argument with respect to infringing use would be the same if only 10 percent  if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the use were illegitimate and infringing. is that correct?
justice scalia, it  we're not  it's not regular practice. it does happen, and the reason it happens, as we've set forth in the brief, have nothing to do with this court's decision to deny review. there are instances, which justice kennedy pointed out, in which following the denial of certiorari review, a court of appeals recognizes the clear error of its prior decision. the question in this case is does it have to send out that decision even though it realizes it's in clear error. and the other reason it sometimes happens over a period of time is that reconsideration, much like the initial decision-making process, is a fluid process. rules 35 and 40 give the court sua sponte the power to engage in reconsideration, and that's exactly the power the court exercised in this case. there are particular reasons in this case, as the panel noted, that there was no unfair surprise to the state in this case, justice o'connor. first, the state took dr. sultan's deposition in july of 1999. the briefing on that subject was  was a matter of days following that deposition, and as the panel correctly noted, there was no unfair surprise to the state. the critical, factual issue in this case was as the result of egregious attorney malfeasance not included in the district court record. in addition, the court of appeals 
so the answer is yes.
well, with respect to the municipal taxpayers and the  and whether there would be standing to challenge the property tax exemption. that's not an issue that has been briefed here. it's 
well, there are other things, justice ginsburg, that are routinely permitted in  in the cells and, in fact, that probably have to be in the cells that can be used. they're given  they're giving  given writing paper, and the testimony of deputy dickson was that they  they fling feces with writing paper and they fling feces  and by the way 
reading the plain language, we 8 think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the 9 vacatur. if you  if a vacatur is a fact  and i think 10 the government has all but 
i take it 
no, but doesn't  doesn't that put you right back in the problem, the original problem, with  with the riverboat? if all it is is tied up, it isn't permanently taken out of navigation. it isn't precluded. all they've got to do is cast the lines off and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.
but these rules that are challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not the profits  the process.
that's the way i read it. it  the  and this is why i was disagreeing with counsel from the other side. it  well, counsel ultimately conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between clinical and preclinical. and the way you read this sentence is  the question, they say, is not whether preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether the "preclinical research conducted under the scripps- merck agreement." and then the next sentence explains what that means. the experiments did not supply information for submission to the united states food and drug administration, but, instead, identified the best drug candidate. so, i think what they're describing as the question presented is whether preclinical research that is  that is not directed to supplying information for submission to the food and drug administration, but, instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.
well, it may not be fairly included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument asserted to defend the judgment.
counsel, i'm puzzled about one thing. i just  maybe it's just my stupidity. but assume he thought it was a martian, and assume he thought  does he have to think it was wrong to kill martians? or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to kill martians, then what do you do? does it matter whether he thinks it's right or wrong to kill martians, in other words?
so, if we vacate it and the case is remanded on that ground, i assume it's still open for you to point out to the oregon supreme court that they were in error about the  about the status of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it admitted on that ground. why isn't that the way to handle the matter, rather than your 
 who that party is. let's go back to your  when you started this case, you said that you would, on discovery  this is what you said in  at the time of your initial complaint  determine if there is an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties. what discovery did you pursue to find out if there was an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties?
well, that's what i asked, if this  i know that, certainly in the context of the vienna convention, there have been the series of decisions you mentioned; but i was wondering whether, outside the vienna convention, there has been any similar judgement of the icj that operates directly on individuals.
 there other examples of  of cases in which the time in which a claim can be brought may have expired before the cause of action accrues.
a number of letters bundled  i wouldn't  i wouldn't be surprised to see what could happen if, in fact, the liability is allowed. if you're  you know, you go to put it into the mailbox, and a piece slips out of the mailman's hand and lands on the porch, and it's one of those cellophane envelopes, and it's slippery. i mean, that's 
no, your honor, and i apologize if i misstated  and it gave you that impression.
we could say that 
the two-year rule is only a damages rule that applies only in title vii cases. and it's triggered in cases such as where there has been equitable tolling or equitable estoppel, because the employer  it was a promotion case or a pay case 
that's not in the materials, 502(c)?
okay.
is there any indication that there were or were not present court security officers?
but the court  even from the court's perspective, was it the same three judges that did the  that did the plan, the court-ordered plan? and i thought that the  the judge who presided told us in his latest opinion that they never anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed, they tried to stay as close as they could to the then-existing plan.
the preexisting law in hawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on the actual value, and subsequent to the debt limitation, the territorial law also put it on actual value. i would suggest, your honor, certainly if there is any debate that there's more than one interpretation of the organic act, that deference should be afforded to the guam supreme court's interpretation of that. that is well established under this court.
that certainly was a formulation of the test. it's been  we can accept it as the formulation of the test. and it was accepted by the california courts below. they attempted to apply that test. they announced the proper  the correct clearly established law of this court, and then proceeded to analyze the issue. below, however, on federal habeas review, the circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to define clearly established law under aedpa. instead of assessing the state court's application of the general rule, the circuit court narrowed this court's general rule into one that specifically condemned buttons. instead of granting the state court wide leeway to apply this court's general rule, it  the circuit court created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit buttons in any case.
all right, if that's the law, then whether  of course an automobile could, could kill people. of course it can. so can a lot of things. but an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though both could end up with the person being chased dead. so aren't we supposed to look at all the circumstances, including the circumstance of what  one that interests me, one, is that the right standard? two, did scott know that the reason he was chasing this person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record could show?
where we're back to 
but isn't that a misstatement? isn't the conclusion that they're trying to draw that congress doesn't want them to exercise the authority they have for this purpose? and isn't that something quite different? and doesn't that raise the question whether that is a legitimate concern for them under the statute that does give them the authority?
your honor, this  the only place you will find the words here are the transcript of the status conference on january 31, 1997. that's the joint appendix beginning at page 80, and you will not find a finding regarding the ends of justice. you will not find mention of the  the public interest or any of the other balancing factors in the act 
well, as the government says, it does  certainly does not encompass question 2, because it eliminates the word "treaties." it's a change from the habeas corpus statute. more generally, it doesn't do two things. first, if that's the reading that the government wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the  that the president has the ability to block habeas corpus or post-dta review for all time, because, justice alito, it doesn't turn on  you can't walk into court right after you're convicted, under the dta; you can only walk into court after a final decision. and a final decision requires the sign-off of the president of the united states. and so, effectively, this reading would give a litigant the ability to block federal court review for all time.
and if 
no, your honor, not a batson violation. now, whether it's evidence of  of 
 legislation isn't 
shell and texaco should have done this. they should have said, okay, we're making equilon for these  for these cost savings. you, equilon, can make the price decisions if you want to. or they could say, you make the gasoline, give it to us, like gm and toyota, and we will separately price it on our own.
which is not what we're talking about here.
where does that appear in the judicial code? does it appear under the provisions concerning jurisdiction?
yes.
yes, and the other argument is that if you don't do it, there's no way to  to get a case dismissed before it goes to a jury. you're saying every claim is going to be a jury trial. i mean, that  you know, come on.
he said more than that. i think he said it was 
well, they were videotaping during the course of the search. but if i can go through the facts which might clarify things. officer muehler, who was the officer in overall charge of the  of the search, testified at trial that the search ended at 8:40 a.m. officer brill said a little bit later than that. he tied  but there's a second video. there are two videos. the second video is from 8:50 to 8:57. at the time that the second  the second video started at 8:50, officer brill testified that the search was over. the  the evidence log  the last entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence being logged into the  into the case. officer brill testified that ms. mena was kept for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second video and her handcuffs were not released until she was brought back around from the  the separate converted garage back into the house and 
thank you, mr. thro. mr. garre.
oh, now the person disappears afterwards, is unavailable.
 than  in some sense, than a $50 penalty. that's right. but this is a person 
what if the  what if the court says, we will weigh it to the extent of determining whether, in light of the state's case, the proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh test? that's weighing. is  is that  is that legitimate?
doesn't the prison litigation reform act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?
i try to avoid all of them, your honor, the frivolous and the unreasonable, both. and i think we all do.
yes.
don't you have to show injury from their decision here? the fact that other people, or you presumably as well might be injured by their decisions that you are not challenging here, that doesn't help your standing here, does it?
may i ask 
so even if this product said, warning: may not be effective in high ph soils, that's not good enough?
okay.
no, i realize that. but you concede  i think you concede that the  that the so-called initiation has got to be a voluntary initiation. you don't take the position that it's merely magic words. isn't that correct?
well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy. every firm in a concentrated industry engages in  i mean, normally conscious parallelism, and i know there are economists who think that that should be the case, but i thought the law to date was that the department of justice is not given by the sherman act the authority to remake the entire american economy. but if we accept your view i guess it is.
well, your honor, i think, i think, as i say, there are two tests. one is whether there's an identifiable sum. we were talking about with respect to grants are the easiest case. there's another case as when there's a challenge to an entire program that the government has identified as a particular program. and then the question, the second question that the court has identified in flast, was is it incidental or not. is it something that is peripheral 
mr. bopp, then can we return to my question? do we view the ad in isolation, and do we discount the connection by your organization of this senator with the filibuster that you said was a very bad thing?
may i just make this one point? is it correct that the issue is whether it's reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it unreasonable?
does it ever define them as noncontractable? i mean, i  i  your answer, i suppose, is well, what  what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to 
if that is correct, then your whole argument rests on the fact that, although he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy, that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let people, including the police, come into an area which is under her control, as well as his. is that it?
 quite correct, in our view, justice ginsburg. we believe petitioners are requesting the piggie park standard. we believe the solicitor general is proposing the christiansburg garment standard. and we think we're smack in the middle, with fogerty. now 
and i have not heard the other side make an argument that there is a rational distinction between the two. and the truth is if epa wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that is to eliminate the concept of modification, what it should have done is two things. it should have  it should have deleted 52.01. and it should have adopted the proposed regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. this is on page 9 of their brief. this statement is astonishing to me. "the term major modification serves as the definition of modification or modified when used in the act in reference to a major stationary source." if they had adopted that regulation in 1980, i wouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later. we would have litigated this question in 1980 because then we would have said that's flatly inconsistent with the statutory scheme because you're not entitled.
that's right.
i think it was, justice stevens, because you can only talk about the conceivable remedies in the context of what the state puts forth. and perhaps a creative judge could say, "aha, but that's the state  you didn't think about this one." and the fact that justice white's opinion  - i think it was justice white's opinion for the court in cleburne  didn't go on and think about four other conceivable bases, i don't think is a fault of the decision-making process at all. with regard to the petitioner's efforts to enforce the guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment, there is no intent standard in the ada at all. in fact, this would scrub out the deliberate-indifference standard entirely, and, in the  at least goodman's reply brief, he admits that that basically would be what would happen. he says that would be appropriate prophylaxis. i think that is an astonishing claim in this case.
if it's incorrect, i want to know why.
your answer  your answer doesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the treaty.
well, your honor, to be clear, we think that this  that the statute establishes a federal floor. it is spending clause  a federal floor  it is  or a default rule that 
because that differential was not reflected in what their agreement provided that each could respectively take out of the joint venture.
with respect to this plaintiff?
is it  is it a necessary element of a successful action for retaliatory discharge that  that the action under the false claims act have succeeded?
but by 
well 
and that's because, justice stevens, that's  that was the particular fact pattern of this  of that case.
yes, yes. so  that's right.
the text on 
and on that i have a preliminary question, because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue. do  in other words, do we still have a case or controversy?
well, of course that's true. and 
so would there be any difference if this had been a post-aedpa  if the circuit precedent had been post-aedpa.
i'm very loathe to deprive either of the states of their  their right to have this court decide matters between them.
i don't think 
yes.
 use of language.
excuse me, mr. smith, first, would you clarify how much land is now claimed as indian  within the tribe's aboriginal right? it's not  well, for one thing clarify while you are not claiming the entire 6 million. didn't they have 6 million acres to start with?
interestingly, your honor, it 
 it did, i think that 
well, i think this court has not decided whether exactions imposed by legislation are treated differently than exactions imposed by administrative proceedings. the state court in this case determined that under state compensation law that mattered. but this court has not decided that. the ninth circuit seemed to indicate that it was in general agreement with the california supreme court, but again, because it didn't actually decide the merits, it just decided that there was an equivalent determination under state law, it didn't get to the final question of whether this was an exaction and what the proper standard was.
doesn't it depend on how you define the "relevant class of activities"? is it the entire class that congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? and is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a  the broad argument that you make?
thank you, ms. williams. mr. thro.
that is true.
 we still conclude that the death sentence is appropriate. so i don't know that we can say that in this case it in any way would change the outcome. in fact, the record 
but on your theory there is no material fact, it seems to me, because your  what you say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching the label.
no?
thank you, mr. heldman.
well 
it would be on pages 32, 34, 36.
 required to be 
5(a), your honor.
in this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?
you'd have a lot  you know, a lot more time at the park. [laughter.]
i'd 
what do you have to say about the failure to inquire about mike?
 as it does in the case of major actions.
no. not if he had knowledge of 
but there's a broader issue of whether principals and teachers around the country have to fear that they're going to have to pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take actions pursuant to established board policies that they think are necessary to promote the school's educational mission.
it presumes that if it's within 90 days, it's timely.
mr. cahill, you started to tell us three reasons why it was important that you regulate. you gave us one. mention the other two.
no, i'm not even thinking of it. i just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would be clear that there is an action. if you win, there would be no problem.
mr. srinivasan, you  you may have convinced me. i'll stipulate that you have convinced me that the argument that you're arguing for would probably be a better method, but you haven't touched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where some of us at least are, are having our  our problems. do you agree that in the absence of the other program, i forget the, the acronym for it  that you really would not have any argument that there is ambiguity in the text here?
but the - but the key point, and i would like to reserve whatever time i may have.
i don't think so.
i thought that's what you were saying, i'm sorry.
general cruz, if you've finished your answer  i didn't want to interrupt you, but that makes  reminds me of a question i wanted to answer you because  ask you, rather, because you make a very persuasive argument in your brief, which i found very helpful, that the  a state should be able to correct a prior gerrymander by  for  with political motivations. i would like you to comment on this suggestion. supposing we said they have an absolute right to do that with one caveat, that any new district has to be more compact  no more  no less compact than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of problems?
you don't agree with what?
so, your position, i guess, is  i think it is, in your last answer  that we really shouldn't be phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the suspect's statement, at this point. we, rather, should be focusing it on whether the statement was, in fact, a spontaneous initiation on his part or a response to the preceding police statement.
you don't mind, but  if  if 8 you think  if you think there's anything to my 9 objection, you're in effect saying, too late.
the obligation is seven lines from the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where they're distinguishing esslinger. and the sentence of the previous paragraph is where they say there's a "duty."
oh.
so it's  it's a matter of respecting the dignity of the states because they participated in the convention, the plan of convention?
 they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.
it seems to me reasonable to me.
okay. if that's fair, then suppose you're coming  suppose the treaty had said  and it's part of american law.
right. and to that extent the prison grievance system worked, because the prisoners provided as much detail as they possibly could and then the prison grievance system went out, conducted its investigation, broadened the universe of relevant facts, and then made a determination. they happened to determine that grievances were not meritorious. obviously, petitioners disagree with that assessment. that's why they sued in federal court. but the prison grievance system worked. to borrow from the third circuit's decision in spur v. gillis, a cooperative ethos between inmate and jailer was achieved, because so long as the prisoner provides sufficient information for the grievance system to go out and answer any unresolved questions and so long as the prison grievance system avails itself of that opportunity then the claim is exhausted. if there are no further questions, i'd like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.
but what about virginia 
the caterpillar didn't start over and newman-green wasn't detected till appeal, but the appeals court didn't say start over.
i will. with due deference to my colleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages. and that's why i thought that the approach that we brought to the court from the other nine circuits is a simpler  what i would call a simple two-step. their approach actually can be read, as we did in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but i think the problem with the government's rule is it is so broad and it does not rely upon any of the court's precedents in  in its writing. and so what you do, if you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create confusion. and secondly, what you do is you make a whole new set of rules that are separate and apart from what you  the court has previously done in its aedpa jurisprudence. to be able to touch upon slack v. mcdaniel, to be able to draw upon martinez-villareal, to be able to take from rhines v. weber, create a formula and a package that's familiar to the courts, to take a rule that's 177 words long that the government puts together that i interpret as being favorable to my client and they interpret as being unfavorable to my client, i think just puts the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case should try to avoid. so my comment on it is that it may well, if it's read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that we're saying and what i refer to as a simple two-step test. and if not, it's just going to be a source of great confusion.
 but does the state have to say, "we are going to convict you of a lesser offense," in the constitution?
isn't a good sign of what might have happened what actually happened when the police came in, which was there was an effort to hide the evidence?
 hypothetical.
i mean, that's what  - or 200 cases in the 
we think part of the repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that these securities claims have simply been repleaded as antitrust claims. congress wasn't aware of any problem of this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities violations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as antitrust claims. and congress of course relied 
i think this court has said that you can accommodate religions. they've also said that you can acknowledge the role that religion has played in our society and i think in both contexts, a focus on purpose is probably not a prudent exercise of judicial resources. but i would like to talk about the purpose here because i think what you have here is a display of a document alone in the first instance that certainly was at least defensible and probably constitutional, yet the courts below got off on the wrong foot by saying that the first display was open defiance of this court's decision in stone against graham and i think this court's cases themselves suggest that the contextual differences between the school and the courtroom are enough to at least make the display not in open defiance. now there was the second display and we are not here to defend the second display but that was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit filed against the first display. now, i don't know if that second display was the product of bad legal advice or simply frustration at the first lawsuit being filed but i don't think it should make a constitutional difference. in the lynch against donnelly case, mayor lynch, after the aclu filed a lawsuit against him, had a rally at the site of the creche, a press conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep christ in christmas and then he led city workers in carols and said they should sing another one that apparently bothers people. yet despite that adverse reaction to the litigation being filed against the city of pawtucket, this court upheld the display and although the dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep christ in christmas, the majority and the concurring opinions did not. and i think that is the proper mode of analysis. now, the second point i think is should these counties be faulted for trying to bring their practices in compliance with the constitution? and i think the answer there is clearly not. and i was going to point this court to the marsh case that's been talked about quite a bit. one of the things that as professor chemerinsky said about the marsh case that this court emphasized in that case itself and in subsequent cases is the fact that the prayers there were non-sectarian in the sense that they did not directly invoke, say, christ. but that actually is something of a change that took place after the litigation began. prior to the litigation, there were explicit references to christ as justice stevens pointed out in footnote 2 of his dissent in that case. but the state of nebraska, after they had a lawsuit, decided let's make this an easier case for the court, not a harder case, and they modified their conduct.
absolutely. the particular conduct at issue 
our, our position would be that it would be up to when the decision became final. whatever the law was up to the time that the decision, the state court decision became final, that is what was clearly established law. i'll continue with our teague analysis because we believe that the claim is barred under either analysis. the 
we have to conclude that the california supreme court has misread california law to agree with you, don't we?
yes, but i think what the government has said is that though it's in navigation, we have a case that says that the  that the seaman's connection to the ship has to be related to the functioning of the ship in navigation. he doesn't have to navigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge operator does that.
yes, that's probably a better articulation.
no. every business, every day fails to enter some new line of business or take some potential competitive action. the mere 
well, your honor, the strongest  plus factors that, in the absence of direct evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a case, which private plaintiffs will almost never have because people don't conspire in public parks. all a plaintiff can have is what are called plus factors under matsushita, and the strongest of those plus factors is what has been alleged in great detail in this complaint of action against self interest. the case law recognizes that 
i don't think this is a realistic problem, justice breyer, that should require the court not to read a statute whose language 
yes. i mean, in the sense that i think that if there were  there  the other side is certainly able to argue, before the military commissions, that certain procedural provisions or the like are prohibited by the law of war or give them some greater entitlement. now, as this court has recognized in cases like madsen, i don't think that the law of war is  you know, extensively regulates procedure. and, indeed, as the madsen court recognized, congress's approach to military commissions has been radically different than its approach to court-martials. in court-martials, they regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure. and if the ucmj and its provisions for court-martials applies, then the defendants are going to get not just miranda, but miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights. if, on the other hand, this court follows the precedents in madsen, it will recognize that only those nine provisions of the ucmj that expressly reference military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a much more common-law, war-court approach, where there's much greater flexibility.
may i ask, if that's the position of the pto, why aren't they proceeding to cancel the patent?
 it's still an oppressive reminder of  of how this individual, if sentenced to life, is  is subject to  to the orders of prison authorities which on some occasions will subject him to this kind of restraint. i  once again, if i were a prosecutor, i'd rather have him dressed up in a nice, new suit and his hair combed and smiling. i would much prefer that to having him in shackles.
i would suggest that it throws a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong. it doesn't  [laughter.]
then  then what's confuse  now, we look at 1367(b) and it says the district court shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by the plaintiff against a rule 19 person who is brought on the defense side.
i  that's correct, justice ginsburg. but the answer is that this is an entirely off-reservation tax on non-indians. we're  we submit that there's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're going to involve an  require states to submit to litigation and engage in balancing every time an off-reservation tax on non-indians has some downstream economic effect. but what about the tax on the car that brings the casino patron to the reservation? what about the tax on the cigarettes or the alcohol or the gambling machinery?
well, what would  i mean, you know, one of the arguments made on the other side is that if you accept the behavior modification theory as an adequate justification, the turner categories essentially become incoherent. what, for example, would be the alternative means in this case if the state said, we realize that the people in  in  at level 2 want to see legal materials very, very much because that is a source of hope for them, and we want them to have that source of hope only if they shape up and  and get down to a reduced level of security, so we're going to stop it, period? what would be the alternatives within the  the turner analysis?
it's just a question of which  whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or by 1983.
does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service?
but can't i punish for the risk of harm to b, c, and d? official
yes, i agree.
mr. kneedler, can i ask you a question, forgetting the statutes for a moment  i  which we've already covered at some length? just going to your constitutional position, it's clear that a person who's not been admitted and has been paroled could be excluded forthwith, summarily, and so forth because he's never been admitted. but does that person have any protection under the constitution? could we shoot him?
thank you, mr. phillips. mr. donahue, you have 3 minutes remaining.
no, did go. did. every one of these cases, i say if they came rushing to the federal court first, no federal judge would even consider giving them a stay so they can go to the first  first time. but these  these come up where someone has gone to the state court and then they come to the federal court with a new petition and there's arguments about what they exhausted and what they didn't. i'm  i'm leaving out the person who never went to the federal  state court at all. that person is  is not the category that this case represents. this case represents the one who goes to state court and comes to the federal court and has arguably some additional claims.
i mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties. they want show rooms where they can go and look at things. all of which costs more money. and where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers  or you have the free rider problem. the customers shop at the place that has the big show room, likes at all the product there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense. now, i just don't think that all the customers want is cheap. i think they want other things besides cheap. i think they want service. i think they want selection. i think they want the ability to view goods and so forth. why do you discount all of those things?
they export in a variety of different physical forms 
justice kennedy, we  we agree mostly with the solicitor general's brief. i believe the solicitor general might take a different position on whether race neutral mechanisms can be used to accomplish race specific purposes.
yes. courts in equity in  in  modern courts in equity in  in analyzing these types of  of claims have permitted these types of allocation 
okay.
i 
so  so you're arguing  then you are. you're saying  this is coming to me a little bit anew. i perhaps didn't read it carefully enough. but i thought  let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that i can't think of a way. let's assume that i can't think of a way of applying the same words to your alien to mean something different than were applied to the alien who was in zadvydas. suppose you lose on that point. now you're saying, well, independently of that, we have a different statute under which we can detain him, namely 1182(d)(5)(a). is that 
good. now, that's what i want you to get to.
do you think there is a 101 problem too?
yes, i know that.
no.
no. i  i suggest that our  my brief might be more coherent than i today. (laughter.)
just while i have you, i'm  just while i have you here  it's not 
it reads certainly like a universal proposition, but i think it is merely an application of what happened in state v. gregory and state v. gay when they were presented at that time in those situations with what they determined to be strong evidence of forensic guilt 
well, justice souter, first of all, i would think general principles of constitutional avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question is a good thing, not a bad thing. the one point i would 
that's interesting. are there, in fact  what's your estimate, guess, as to how many criminal jury-tried cases in california, what percent have two juries? have more than one jury?
was the impact profound because they were in what's now schedule 1, that they were just prohibited? in other words, were doctors allowed to prescribe opium for some purposes?
it doesn't have to be 
if the licensee said, "i am not contesting that patent," that could be.
 at issue here.
well 
may i 
if the eeoc is upheld in the court of appeals and review is sought here, will the government confess error?
no. that was effective. that  that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument. the michigan 
well, in  in terms  in terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there 
yes.
and what is the answer to my strategic site selection hypothetical?
 a brilliant job 
well, that's an 
no, no. i'm assuming this is not evidence of intent. there's independent evidence of both intent and monopoly power. with those two elements established, would this, the kind of evidence i described, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff that could be actual in damages?
 was there a reason why they provided that, in the case of equipoise, the sentence would be death? or is that just a quirk of the way the provision was written?
all that's true, but they  they did promulgate this guideline, as far as  i looked it up. at that time, they said, look, it's going to be disparate impact, and they cited griggs. and people have put comments, which i haven't read yet, but i imagine the comments went to disparate impact. and then when they rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be disparate impact.
well, most of what they did would not have been an okay method of getting a reciprocal easement, anyway. but the attempt to get it would be fine. it's not that they are not entitled to a reciprocal easement. that might have been a problem under nollan and dolan to figure out whether there was enough connection, but i think there would have been enough. the problem was that they were using the right-of-way, which was long gone, as an excuse to get an invaluable piece of property that they had no right to get. they were then trying to  they were basically saying, and they made it explicit, give us this easement for nothing or we'll bury you.
no, please. well, my  my initial view of this case was much like justice souter's and  and i still think that that may be  may be correct. but i thought your answer to justice souter would be that there are many cases in which there is an antecedent federal title which then goes down through successive purchasers, mining claims, for instance, and those are always under state law. i  i thought that would be your answer to justice souter and  and also to justice ginsburg.
is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?
well, my guess is if they did, you probably wouldn't want to rely on it as the authoritative source for interpreting the language of the statute in any event.
the defendant's age? the improper charge? what else can be considered?
not  not by the 
it was objected to, and the objection was sustained. that doesn't mean that comment 
well, if we disagree with you on that  in other words, you're saying we don't even have to reach the anti-lien provision question. if we think the medicaid condition only goes to the extent payments for medical care, then you would lose without regard to the anti-lien provision?
the injunction was entered by the eastern district of illinois and was affirmed by the seventh circuit in a case called bono v. saxby. and the federal court  the  the bureau of prisons adopted the regulations pointed to by the respondents in the c.f.r. as it  in  in  to comply with that injunction. we have not yet sought to have that injunction set aside, but those procedures apply to a very small number of federal prisoners.
 michigan's jurisdiction for all purposes of enforcement?
but you're making the assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not interested in compactness, it's not interested in counties, it's not interested in keeping a university within one  within one district. that's  that's just simply not true.
i agree. there are five (inaudible) where the solicitor general, sort of, pulls the ripcord here.
isn't  isn't that so? (laughter.)
with a statement of reasons, it did, your honor.
that's a disputed point, i gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured psd emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.
yes.
i'm  i'm not sure why  why we should make the classification that you did, that  that retaliatory is simply a species of  of malicious. i mean, i  i can see the similarities, but we've also got an entirely separate first amendment value here which just is not part of the  the analytical mix when you're talking about malicious prosecution. so i'm not sure why we should  we  we should classify it as you argue.
well 
so there's no, no limit in the organic act of any real meaning?
mr. hurd, do you recognize  to narrow what's at issue  that the parent objecting to the school's iep would at least have a burden of coming forward? in other words, i  are you speaking just of the ultimate persuasion burden? wouldn't the parents at least be required to come forward with some reason to believe that the state  the school district's plan is inadequate?
and that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where i understand if it's a federal conviction then it's always brecht on post-conviction relief?
but 
and that would prevail over this 
but they  they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?
mr. madden, there was a question raised about your categories, that is, you have white and then everything else. and it was suggested that if you are looking for diversity, what was  the schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage of asian-americans, but they don't count. what is your response to that?
and yet, i take it it's also your position that if the districting is done in response to the new decennial figures so that there's a need to do something to conform to one person/one vote, that there is nothing illegitimate about political motivation, at least up to some point 
mr. fisher, may i ask you this question? in your view, did the regulations create a legally enforceable obligation?
all right. well, then 
so we don't say the judge is right because he waived it. we're saying he's right because the judge made a procedural error. i'm having a hard time following that.
well, she looked at  she looked at  i guess it's difficult to understand exactly. she was looking  she looked at edwards, she looked at voluntariness, she talked about attenuation. so, she did acknowledge that if it was six months later, he could give a statement.
well, your honor, that is for public schools, and public schools are subject to the first-amendment rights of those who want to enter their forum. but there is a critical difference between that forum, your honor, which the schools opened up to everyone, and the forums in career services, which the schools filter on the basis of one very important 
but  but you accepted the petition for rehearing in this court would also count, although the rule doesn't say that.
why isn't the croupier covered, you know?
if the government let the contract for the building of the church, yes.
see, but it's clearly unusual to say you can be a citizen of two places. and to do that, you had a special statute in 1332. to say you can be a citizen of 40 or 50 states simultaneously, there really is no precedent for that.
 a difficult analysis.
your honor, i think that simply refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree. now, if you interpret that to include money damages, then the second sentence would follow, but i  i think the two have to be construed together. and in our view simply allowing a party to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree in these circumstances would not allow award of money damages. certainly i think congress would be much clearer.
 reflects is the  -
okay.
then we go to the sentencing phase, in which the state has to prove one of eight statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt with jury unanimity. there were three specific aggravating factors that were found by the jury in this instance. and then, the defendant introduces all mitigating evidence, and the standard of introduction is relevancy. but, unlike the walton case, which has a functionally identical provision that is at issue here, the state maintains the burden, while, in walton, the burden was provided to the defendant to demonstrate that the mitigating factors were so substantial to call for leniency.
it's in the  it's cited in the briefs.
well, the  all of the grounds actually.
because they're  they're taking money beyond the claim for medical expense, your honor, because the claim for medical expense is not measured by the amount of the medical expenses in terms of its value. it is measured by the various factors that affect the value of a claim, of which the payout is only one of the factors. had they appeared at the settlement proceeding, had we had 
no, it's not, justice souter. first of all, the hughes opinion on which they rely is crystal clear that the only thing the court found was that there was no procedure to re-empanel a jury on remand. and i point the court to page 208  that's a p.3d citation and 149 in the washington reporter citation  where the court specifically said, we are only talking about remand and not deciding whether these things could ever be submitted to a jury in the first instance.
it was submitted.
i think that, that would be the case, as i indicated, whenever an officer uses force to stop a vehicle at this speed. i think there is  if it is deadly force, and of course this court has not articulated a test of that particular question 
i don't think the  i think the constitution  and the court has recognized that it is legitimate to protect against raiding because we can all suppose how disloyal voters coming into a party could hurt it. but how about disloyal voters leaving a party? because these voters that would come in and vote in the libertarian 
the  in  106(b) and 106(c) specifies the conduct by which a sovereign must  must engage in, in order to waive sovereign immunity in a noncore matter, in those matters not set forth in section 106- 
i agree with that fully, your honor.
thank you, mr. milkey. mr. garre.
well, you say  you call it punishment, but in fact the government's position on each of these particulars has generally been vindicated. when your client has appealed, they've upheld the trespass citations. when you've sued for malicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected. which of the government actions do you not have an existing remedy for, apart from the racketeer and corrupt  rico act or the, this new bivens claim?
well, of course, and they do that.
well, it certainly would be more cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used to follow, which we submit, although the record is  they did not specifically state 
well, that's completely false. in  in the year 2000, the united states government issued a report that contained an extensive appendix, which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious detail the conflicts between land-based ada standards and solas. now, i can give you some specifics, if you would  that are fairly practical, such as the ada requires under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the ship, but solas requires that passengers with disabilities be placed near evacuation points.
well  well, has the  the objection to the instruction been preserved here?
the difference here is simply that there  the amounts, as was suggested earlier, are so minute that there cannot be any significant effect on interstate commerce. there is not even any evidence in this record that there is a market for the drugs that are used under the death with dignity act, much less if there is an illicit trade. there's no question here of  as the court described it in raich, where you had a $10 billion market of 
but it's relevant to this idea of deliberation. for example, if the defendant  the codefendants have testified that the  mr. guzek is the mastermind of this, and that he helped plan this. if the alibi goes to whether or not he was present for all of those events that relate to this issue 
was there any argument in the trial court or in the briefs of the court of appeals as to how to calculate cost? you basically have two markets. you don't usually think of cost when you buy something. but was there any argument as to how to determine whether or not this was below cost in the brooke group sense?
well, i think that the core of what was the concern was  was the taking of the money and the using it for religious purposes. and i think what the 
thank you, mr. clement. mr. katyal.
and not even the eleventh circuit said (b)(3). and therefore, you want to say absolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b) motions escape the strictures of aedpa?
so you're saying my hypothetical could never come up. what i'm trying to do is  it seems to me that your hypothetical is going to take statements that would come in that are pretty far removed from the prosecution that are in odd circumstances, are not just a testimonial at all in anybody's thought, but it keeps them out.
yes.
well, is  is the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique? i  i want  (laughter.)
 how is it  is there any question about how it's going to come out when they take it up again? [laughter.]
 the federal controlled 
because in each case  for all i know, the monks had a fit when gutenberg made his press  [laughter.]
in michigan, i don't. there are cases cited in our brief where, in fact, there are actions  such actions brought. there are several recent decisions in the seventh circuit, for example, where qualified immunity was denied on a knock-and-announce violation in the cases in the district court for trial or settlement. and there may be many cases that don't make the reports, what actions are brought and settled.
 authority.
 but whether 
isn't this the  i may have it wrong  but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested.
thank you, ms. millett. mr. link.
 telephone lines have always been subject to common-carrier regulation.
we don't disagree that the executive could have chosen other avenues. nevertheless, medellin's argument that, given the executive has said, "this should have effect in some other proceeding," we should disregard what the executive has said about this proceeding and apply it here, notwithstanding the president's express determination it wouldn't apply here.
okay. and  and that 
they are, indeed. and this may launch a thousand law-review articles. but with respect to the question before the court, there is a simple and straightforward statutory basis to resolve this case; namely, that section 2253 of the aedpa does not allow a certificate of appealability for nonconstitutional claims.
you could say the same thing if it were a building fraud. suppose there were contractors building a canadian building for the canadian government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and it was to deprive the canadian government of money? i think the statute would clearly apply.
yes, correct, your honor. in  in the circumstances in this case, petitioner johnson, for example, during his 15 years, had been transferred on five separate occasions, and the circumstances which he experienced are not unusual within the california prison system. indeed, an outside-the-record fact: within the last three weeks, he's been informed that he's to be transferred yet again within the california prison system to another facility called corcoran.
that's fine.
you didn't  you didn't assert that all the sovereign immunity for the entire state and all of its institutions had been waived simply because of the claim by vmi. you didn't make that argument.
thank you. the jurors who convicted mr. house of first degree murder heard that semen stains on the victim's clothing matched mr. house. they didn't hear the dna evidence which showed that not to be the case. the jurors heard 
i thought your point was that it was not an issue after the election.
why is that? what  what statute is that?
 can work the other way. you would be up here, saying, "oh, he had 24 hours. he thought he was going to get the death penalty. he knew the other man was turning on him to implicate him in the murder. his agony was increasing." i mean, i  it seems to me the question is whether or not the curative measures were adequate.
well, he did 
yes.
yes. there  there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the prosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of payton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's statements cannot 
as a matter of arkansas law, a claim should not be dismissed until all parties are  the rights of all parties are determined.
well, i mean, the fourth amendment analysis after katz doesn't  doesn't depend on trespass, and  and you have said up to this point that there is no search. and then you have quite rightly said that we have had as a consideration in our minds analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest. so i'm assuming  i'm assuming that the police can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell. and if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to, is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the privacy interests of the people who own the house?
right.
so 
the 
even so, there was 
some states do have statutes of 13 limitations. many don't. massachusetts is a prime 14 example. it doesn't. many of the cases of this type that 15 come through the federal courts arise based on a  a 16 vacated massachusetts conviction. my understanding is 17 that perhaps as many as half the states don't have 18 limitation provisions in non-capital cases.
is the  is the respondents' position properly characterized as asking for expectancy damages or is that too simplistic a view?
if it's done in this statute, the problem that would remain, justice kennedy, is this is an election law that presumably has to be justified on the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of elections. and when you have 
 it for the proposition that it  as an example of how the ninth circuit rule, quote, "risks the tolling of the federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review in the state appellate courts." that's what we cited.
that  i didn't hear your 
and why 
justice breyer, in order to violate the wire fraud statute, you have to use deception in order to deprive another 
i  i think 
that's correct.
are a 
but there  there is a cert petition filed in what case? in the june case?
no, i'm just asking could you, yes or no. i 
there is no contract but there is an order. there is a court issued order based upon her allegations and based upon her submissions to the court. your honors, again, ms. gonzales took the risk here of seeking an order of protection and airing her dirty laundry in public, and she did so with the reasonable expectation that the order meant something, that law enforcement would enforce it.
general scott, i suggest you try to answer her question.
what would any reasonable juror, justice scalia.
that's right. we don't  we don't know whether that was the case here or not.
the compensation was strictly for the kansas lands that were denied to them. and it's important to note that the senecas 
you've 
and this alone wouldn't  wouldn't remedy the 
that  that to me was  was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a serious shaw violation. and  and the two are really linked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by virtue of what it did in 23, that the state claims a right to do what it did in 25.
the scow is a vessel.
i think that there is evidence historically that a letter would be testimonial, certainly coming out of cobham's case and  and other circumstances.
i don't think you've answered his question.
i'd be happy to. in  in solid waste agency, this court looked at 404(g) and determined that it had  it was not enlightening as to the meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because congress did not define other waters in any way. and this court likewise concluded that 404(g) was simply not before it and would not draw any conclusion from it. so i submit that it is really irrelevant. i note  i want to draw this court's attention to our footnote 1 in our reply where we point out that  that in every formal rulemaking, the corps and the epa have excluded drainage ditches from the definition of tributary. it is here and now that these agencies are redefining the term tributary to include anything in the hydrological chain. the sixth circuit decision says that any hydrological connection suffices as a significant nexus to bring in wetlands under federal jurisdiction. of course, in  in page 31 of the opposition, the government argues that neither the directness  excuse me  nor the substantiality of a tributary's connection to traditional navigable waters is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. it's simply not true that the government is only identifying channelized conduits as tributaries. anywhere water flows is a tributary in their book. let me also address something that this court did in swancc. it was not the lack of a hydrological connection in that case that informed this court's decision to exclude those isolated ponds from federal jurisdiction. it was the fact that those  that the regulation of those isolated ponds did not meet the terms of the act and there was no clear indication congress intended to regulate isolated ponds. i submit that's this case. in this case, there is no clear indication that congress intended to regulate wetlands 20 miles from the nearest navigable water. the 
 seek a change.
yes, and we've fought many battles on those fronts in the state courts. and the reality is that the federal forum with its familiarity with federal law, its solicitude towards federal law is the appropriate forum in these cases, more so than the state court. and what may seem like an efficient 
the only expectation, justice kennedy, that we are proposing is that my client  and aliens, generally, because this is an analysis that must be done on a categorical basis  reasonably expected that congress wouldn't change the consequences of their reentries far in the past without doing so explicitly.
it depends upon their being a party aggrieved. that is defined in black's law dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.
ms. graeff, you have 5 minutes remaining.
the implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation. and this is what the court said in the arctic coast decision. it saw that this was 
so it's maybe three  three a year? is that what it was?
that's true, mr. chief justice, but  but we think that the fact that this is a single judge changing his mind is exactly why there is no abuse and why this isn't a case like calderon where the full court stepped in 2 days before the execution. this is a case where the same three judges who denied all habeas relief and denied rehearing came back later and said, you know what? we made a serious mistake. mr. thompson deserves an evidentiary hearing to test the reliability of his death sentence. those are not circumstances unlike recall of the mandate by a full court of appeals 
it doesn't, your honor, but the fact that there is a court order here in place individualizes the entitlement. it makes it personal. ms. gonzales went into court and aired her dirty laundry under the assumption, mistakenly here, that she was going to be provided protection from the state. that if she went in and explained the situation to the courts, the courts would issue her an order that meant something. and it could only mean something if police officers are willing to enforce it. the legislature in turn has said, if a person has this kind of order, you shall use every reasonable means to enforce it. now, in order to enforce it, the police officers are going to have to, as they respond to every criminal complaint, make an initial probable cause determination. that's part of every day law enforcement.
the 
ah. ah, you're saying  i  what i just heard was, it's  the reporter just was a stand-in for the average person, that the average person had these constitutional rights, which may have been a 
yes. well this 
right.
well, my understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are already outside the mother.
no. no 
that's correct.
yes, but the  the antitrust standing issue is not the same as the relevant market issue that was decided, is it?
 assume that the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" special circumstance in this case was invalid?
how do you go about determining whether something falls within somebody's job duties? how specifically does that have to be set out?
now, why would that not also have satisfied the objection of the warrant  the argument you make in this court? because it would have made it clear that there is now probable cause to believe it will be there at the time of the execution. why isn't that sufficient to make the warrant valid?
but when you're looking to a bond debt limitation, you're looking at the bond market, you're looking at investors, the certainty of an appraisal value, actual real value, and 
well, there is a logical break, because if it travel down the statute and reach all the way to "misleading conduct," what congress would have written is a statute, when you read the definition of "misleading conduct," that says, "whoever knowingly knowingly makes a false statement," because the definition of misleading conduct includes "knowingly making false statements," "knowingly omitting things," "intentionally engaging in deceptive behavior." and you'd end up with a  in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever. it makes sense for congress to have said, "knowingly used force or intimidation." but then when you get to the word "threat," there is inherent knowledge in it. "corruptly" inherently embodies knowledge. and the definition of "misleading conduct" inherently 
wasn't that the pre-aedpa standard?
 outweigh aggravators.
i thought it was part of your complaint that  that the business here was going after your client in particular.
is it? i  i would assume it's not mitigating.
well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related. it comes down to misnomer cases. it's one thing to say  what the officers told the da, although after they arrested him  didn't they describe the whole episode from when they saw alford pull up behind the disabled vehicle? they described that and they mentioned the flashing lights. they described the whole episode up till the point where they  the officers apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed  they told the da everything, and he said, yes, you have probable cause.
well, at some point, what  what turns into emergency resolution moves over into interrogation, and once you reach interrogation, then you have reached the core of what crawford talks about 
i believe the defense counsel would have been entitled to make such an argument. i don't think there would have been any need for corrective instruction. but what they proposed, which was conflicting in two different respects, just did not meet the muster.
no, that's not true. the 
before you do that, mr. franklin, is  is the rule that  that we're operating under that congress had to have made it clear 
it  that  it  what it says  it says newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactive. it doesn't say by the supreme court. that's the rationale the courts have used. but if i could move to the 
you say that a tribe can market its exemption?
is the state post-conviction application still pending on the 90th day?
that  that might be a concern, your honor. i don't think the  the historical practice supports it because the fact is that while there's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting, whatever one wants to call it, in the last several decades, there have been precious few, if any, examples of anybody trying to convene the legislature before the next census to try to fix it. it is extraordinarily rare. and the reason for it is we  there's a general tradition we've established in this country that whatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if it's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next time 
well, suppose the state has, which is going straight to aedpa. does that mean that teague is out entirely, even the first category, that is a decision, a substantive decision that would mean that what defendant did was not a crime?
well 
absolutely.
it's 
but  but  the whole rationale of your case  if i were you writing your brief, i would have this problem. this really matters to the inmates, but that's exactly the state's point. that's the reason it's taken away. it really means something. and i  i just  i just don't know what to do with that conundrum.
that means  that leads to the question of why do they need it?
well, would it be either proper or required by the washington trial court to tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the charge is assault? there is also the possibility of a sentence enhancement. it's a 1-year enhancement if it's a deadly weapon. it's a 3-year enhancement if it's a firearm and a pistol is a firearm. would the judge err if he did that? or another way of putting the same question, would it be proper for the judge to leave out the 1-year deadly weapon instruction and just instruct you can  you must determine whether it's an assault and you must determine whether there's a 3-year enhancement for the use of a firearm?
and as i read the instructions, it did require there be three elements of the violation of section 2 which, two of which were not discussed by the court of appeals.
 would have obtained the evidence 
as long as there was a good faith determination. if there was a mistaken belief that there was a lack of probable cause, then there is no violation of due process. the process has been provided.
 we're dealing with in this case.
cities and counties 
let me give you another parallel. let's suppose that districts have been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes for years. can you take race into account in drawing new districts to remedy that racial discrimination?
i believe  excuse me, your honor.
well, the minute  the minute 15 that you  you say that, it  it seems to me that you 16 have to accept the petitioner's argument.
yes, we did.
no.
yes, and  and 
mr. verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning. the planning is all done by the government 
there hasn't, as  as we've talked about, been a problem with interracial violence in the cells because they're not housed that way. there are problems with 
yes. we believe that the court of appeals erred  or district court and court of appeals erred, as a matter of law, in entering the injunction 
in terms of cases that involve injunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to give you the relief that you have  that you are seeking, that is true. but when you are seeking money damage, it is at least theoretically possible  we're not saying that we're going to ask for that, but at least theoretically possible that the federal district court could still give us relief. and therefore, what we are asking for is 
thank you.
well, it would be a special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to raise the bar, allowed a state to raise a bar to consideration of the issue. but i want to go back to your answer to justice stevens' question. you, you say you draw no distinction between the, the procedural failing as a bar to raising the issue and as a basis for determining a standard of harmless error review later. i don't understand why you, you can maintain there is no distinction because if they may not consider it as the basis for their, their standard of harmless error review, assuming we have such a thing, then what are they supposed to use as their standard? your answer i take it is chapman, but chapman as i understand the statement of federal law would not apply  state law  chapman would not apply in these circumstances. and if you were in a federal court and this were a federal conviction chapman wouldn't apply on collateral review. so it seems to me that you've either got to accept the distinction between procedural error as bar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard of review, or you have no way to figure out what the, what the standard of review should be.
 the main campus, which is a mile and a half away.
 for purposes  if you're trying to take the partnership and tag it to another group of rag-tag individuals, that would not be an enterprise in fact because that's not an  an association of individuals. it's a partnership which has an entity apart from the individuals. now, if you disaggregated all of the individuals within the partnership and called them individuals and said that they group with another group of individuals, then, yes. i think if you could demonstrate that there is the loose organization, common purpose, and all of the requirements for having an association-in-fact available, sure, that wouldn't be any problem.
it doesn't say that in any  any black letter statement.
your honor, the answer is: that's correct, and that's exactly what happens in the commerce clause when a person from virginia buys something from illinois and has it delivered to himself in virginia. they don't pay the sales tax.
okay. suppose the  the state says, well, we  we don't  we don't agree with you. then  then what happens? then they're at loggerheads and you go to justice souter's position i suppose.
that 
is the question whether instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether it is flawed when it's viewed together with the instruction on employer negligence?
no, the court has said  the court has said, as a general matter, as a matter of federal law, a tribal merchant on tribal land can be required to collect sales taxes from non-indians, at least for the purchase of goods that were manufactured off the reservation.
your honor, there are three situations in which the school district can be the complaining party. first, where a parent refuses to subject his child to evaluation for special services under the act, and the school district disagrees and initiates that action.
does the government have  i'd like to ask you the same question justice stevens asked mr. pincus about the broader question. much of the economic literature on which you rely sort of sweeps aside the particular question today because it rejects the notion of tying as a problem in the first place. but does the government have a position on that? assuming there's monopoly power in the tying product, the government's position is that that still presents an antitrust problem?
yes, but there's no way to confine it to the individual, is it? i mean, the  on your  on your target theory, a  a general discriminatory animus as a basis for breaching a contract with general motors would give a right of action to  to every minority employee of general motors. isn't that correct?
state officers don't have any money. [laughter.]
fine. and where did the agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a wetland acts as a sponge? it's very plausible to me. it's just that there may be a need to drop a citation somewhere. (laughter.)
but they don't have the same  they don't have the same property interest as a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever. the child doesn't have that interest in the home.
well, what 
right.
just because congress in  in the  at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a supreme court that would readily find implied causes of action, we  we have to do that for all these old statutes.
so if, in fact  if, in fact, the state legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify.
your honor 
no. it says when the judge signed it. that's correct.
and i don't  there was never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay our workers' compensation.
we'll litigate it. we'll figure out a number eventually, i'm sure.
and what's the difference between the one and the other?
right.
let  let me tell you 
if we rule for the respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in california?
all i'm telling you is, he's at a bus station. the facts are that a lot of people who travel on buses are drug couriers. this person is a parolee. would that run afoul of the  of any arbitrary and capricious limitation?
your honor, slusa precludes precisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which is beyond the scope of 10b-5. for example, 10b-5 requires scienter. slusa has no scienter requirement. so a non-scienter-based state law claim is still precluded under slusa. what slusa requires is a misrepresentation, omission, manipulation, or deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. period. all of that is present in this complaint. they allege omissions.
right.
well, but really he hasn't been given an attorney yet, your honor. we have to remember this is the arrest has been made and he's confronted with options.
well, there is a requirement in state court that you plead with specificity what type of claims you're raising in a post-conviction 
well, i  i thought not. is there a 
finish.
thank you, ms. nield. ms. percival, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.
so your point is that there are petitions filed here that would enable this court to decide whether the michigan supreme court was correct in holding the statute constitutional.
what good is  what does the restraining order do, then, other than give her a right to sue the person who is restrained for contempt?
would you  would you say thoughtful rather than inflexible? (laughter.)
well, the 
i think there may be a slight semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of the day all we're asking for the court to do is to evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities, interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you traditionally do, take into account whether there is an allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a  rises to the level of a strong inference.
 the  can't the california courts adopt a  give us a 60-day rule, or a 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule? and if they don't do it, why should we do it?
 is, we have this case, exactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting these people to eat  say, "eat beef," what they say do is, they get people together and say, "don't eat too much beef." i put 
but not all. you couldn't have a  if i remember right, a permissive counterclaim.
why not? the  hiland  is that the one?
the  the difference in the general population, the prisoners are out 10 to 12 hours a week for recreation, and in the control unit, they are out 7 hours a week.
 it's about 
that class of activities is not before the court. that is actually before 
well, you can talk about the "responding party," or the "defendant," but the term "defendant" is sufficiently broad to include one who official defends or denies, and that would be a term  and it's been used in the past, as long as 85 years ago  to discuss the person who might be liable for damages in 
so you don't agree with the argument that we've heard this morning that the transformation of american retailing since the 1970s and the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and that overruling dr. miles would reverse that?
there's one aspect of saffold that you haven't addressed. we not only said what we said about they're saying "on the merits," we actually cited a case that involved exactly the situation here  namely, welch versus newland, a ca9 case from 2001. and we cited that as an example of how the ninth circuit rule, quote, "risks the tolling of the federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review in the state appellate courts," close quote.
are we bound by that fact?
justice 
thank you, mr. johnson. mr. blume, you have 2 minutes remaining.
i  i guess that respondent uses the language in the way it  he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio. there's no such thing as a contract that is void ab initio, is there?
i would respectfully submit, your honor, that they have, especially in colorado. this statute is much more detailed than a run of the mill criminal or civil statute.
pardon me. the burden on him would be in the context of an evidentiary hearing, which never took place. the district court in this case didn't reach that issue, because they found that statutory tolling 
 is it clear that the policeman cannot do it?
well, it's odd that you can be compelled to 
well, the government, in the concern  in situations where it may be concerned about public health, doesn't say, "don't eat meat." it  there may be nutritional standards. and usda does have nutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to. but what the government is doing here is facilitating a situation, facilitating promotion of a commodity. there is a structural defect in a market like  a market for a fungible commodity, and i think it's important to understand what congress was responding to here. when you have a fungible commodity, when you have a lot of small producers, no one of those producers has an incentive to advertise 
right.
 that have to establish the probable 
it's definitely no. (laughter.)
i don't think we usually think of  of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.
well, i don't think so, your honor, because i think it preserves 
you  you'd say, well the language is clear  clear, but let's go  let's go on equitable tolling.
well, that isn't the test, i mean, whether you can convince a jury. i think you  you have to acknowledge that  that before we  we say that these trial instructions were adequate to  to give you your victory, we  we have to find that at least a reasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that  that both of these  both of these adverse actions qualified as discrimination under 703, if  if we're going to use that test. right? you acknowledge that.
well, i 
and  and 
apparently 803(1) has the first exception 
i mean, if that's so, then go back for a minute, please, to justice souter's question. it doesn't concern violence. i'm  certainly if violence is involved or a direct action against an employee or the competitor himself, then i'll assume you'd win. but the line i think that he drew very clearly and i think justice stevens picked up on, as i heard it, is a  a fraud where the person defrauded is not the competitor and the only effect of the fraud is to lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud. now, if that's so, you either draw justice souter's line or you don't. if you do draw justice souter's line, then you stay out of the thicket. if you don't, you'll have all the problems that were mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between one person, two persons, 100 people. there is no way to know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person did or did not lead to the shift of sales. there is no way to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case prices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind of ability of the competitor  of the defrauding person to take over the market. all those things that are issue in antitrust cases and totally unsolvable are suddenly imported into rico, where if you really want to bring a case, bring an antitrust case, and at least people know how to face it there. that's  that's the  that's the kind of claim  that's the kind of problem that i think you're facing, and i'd like you to have the chance to respond to it.
yes.
mr. waxman.
thank you counsel. mr. nager, we'll hear now from you.
that's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters. the only thing that's exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis. congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services. we think it's very notable that it did not and we read from that that congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.
 it's not a first amendment problem. it does not have the objection that you're raising.
may i ask you, this is the hypothetical: supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines. but then he says, i recognize that in this circuit there is a strong interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has adopted a rule where they will presume a within guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in those cases. and i think with respect to the court of appeals, i think i would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence, so i will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower. what should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?
again, it's  it's because of the nature of the allocation.
was your client ever found guilty of any offense at all?
what is the 
your honor, in state oil the same argument was made. the argument was made that, while we don't have compelling empirical evidence that albrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have compelling empirical evidence that resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is generally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such empirical evidence there's no basis for overturning precedent. this court unanimously 
would you add too that he's judgment-proof?
 kansas 
your reference to the will of congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek.
these are strange contracts, of course, aren't they? i mean, are there any other contracts that the government has to enter into? i mean, the secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the  of a federal health program, doesn't he?
it is requesting the same sort of 
 and that's how i understood this came  case came up here. the contract you're relying on is the contract between the corporation  between the corporation and domino's. and can you  can you sustain a lawsuit for the violation of that contract? there was no mention of any other contract. i don't know why we should send it back down so you can mention a contract that you haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief in opposition. so that's the issue, whether the violation of the contract between mcdonald  between domino's and your client's corporation will allow your client to get  to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target. that's how i understood the lawsuit.
well, i mean, that  that may, that may be true of this stage; but justice scalia's question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case? how do we formulate this rule? and if we say that it's not jurisdictional, not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow the hypothetical that he puts to you.
well, i don't think the board of  of contract appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. they just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. now, what the federal circuit said was that funds for inherent federal functions are available. and we think that's wrong for the reasons i've said. i don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. but even if you thought that they did, i think it's clear that funds for inherent federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core federal function 
it may well, and that is something that is appropriately judged under the pike standard.
i think  i 
he's just going back to 
why?
the argument is that this court in tinker articulated a rule that allows the school boards considerable discretion both in identifying the educational mission and to prevent disruption of that mission, and this is disruptive of the mission 
justice souter, in the sparks case, as well as in the rivera case, no, there was no such order. and what the sparks court said, reading rule (b) correctly we believe, is there's no provision in rule 41(b) that requires a formal order. that's what's set forth in (d) in response to motions. and the reason is a case is not final until the court of appeals issues its mandate. and so the burden is on the litigant 
well how is it  i mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw. you assert he didn't do it versus something else. but it's easy, let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an accident; i was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort. now, are they denying the incident in that case?
you're saying that those facts could not reasonably be found to be  to produce a situation in which the defendant believed he would be hounded to talk, so he said, "what the heck, i'll talk."
well, then why don't you tell us what's wrong with the government's test and with the petitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it?
yeah. and you're saying they did this just  not in the context of just single ipos, but that they agreed across ipos that they would all do this.
what is the case that says that, that the child's invitation overrides the parents' objection?
i have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it. you take students and you assign a per-pupil number to each individual student.
yes. yes, your honor. if the court has no more questions, may i reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal?
that's correct.
right.
yes. and i'm not saying at the  at the margins there  there may not be doubtful cases, but what i'm saying is that this court in noerr v. pennington doctrine has recognized and adopted objective criteria to distinguish between genuine efforts to influence the government, which is not subject to the sherman act, and sham issues  efforts to regulate 
no. you alleged the exact opposite in footnote 3. you said when they stonewalled you, we assumed they were going to follow sims.
well, i  i suppose that in a purely discretionary system  i  i can't quite think of the hypothetical  the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce. if  if the evidence of identification is  is quite clear  is quite clear  and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, i think that may affect the trial court's balance. i  i take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not  not less. i  i take that point. but just as  as an absolute rule, i'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant. that's what i'm saying.
well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence. that's a good reason not to put it in section 53 either.
why?
what employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?
i would suggest it's not irrational because what you do is, you've given the defendant the option as a strategic matter either to present it to the jury or if they think that will guarantee an award of punitive damages against them, they can withhold it and present it only to the trial official judge. this is a protection to the defendant rather than, you know, an oddity, i think.
 this question? supposing the charge had been slightly amended. instead of saying, "the criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with osama bin laden to commit the following offenses," it said, "it and osama bin laden attempted to  aided and abetted in committing the following offenses." would it then be  violate the laws of war?
 in competition just from  on a day-to-day basis over the years, over a period of time, trying to get business?
if that physical golden disk were actually put into a computer and used without more.
by the way, if it's constitutional, it's pretty easy to see a state might well say, let's do that, what a good idea. i mean, they might think it's a good idea. i don't know what people think is a good idea. we'll provide for interlocutory appeals right in the middle of cases because the prosecution can never appeal at the end of the case. that's really unfair. and we'll do this little thing here, and that way we give the prosecutor a chance.
well, then, if that's so, you ought to remand this case.
excluding the confession. excluding the confession.
absolutely.
okay.
they did that to prove she had sex with her husband? is that the reason? (laughter.)
but let's 
justice kennedy, the patent presumption makes economic sense because, more likely than not, a patent used to effect a requirements tie will have market power. justice breyer said at the outset that a patent is intended to confer market power. that's what a patent is  is registered for. it's intended to create legally enforceable barriers to entry that make it rivals  entrance into the market more difficult. that's what it's intended to do. it doesn't matter that 95 percent 
but they're two identical pieces of property, and they'll say  one say, "you're going to be taxed at a lower rate if that's where you're living, if that's your homestead; but if you happen to live outside the state, you're going to get taxed at a higher rate." it would seem to be very similar to what you're challenging here.
what sense does it make for the parents to tell that to the school system? i mean 
 a teacher speaking 
but they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?
well, the commerce clause speaks in terms of commerce.
including excise?
the premise of our  the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. the idea  for example, you  prostitution is an economic activity. marital relations is not an economic activity. we could be talking about virtually the same act. and there is a market overhang for  from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. we look at the activities, and we 
but ultimately this court in singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the patients to proceed. i understand that it was a plurality opinion on the  on the jus tertii standing.
two members of the same gang?
okay. well, and you have arguments against both of those two. which arguments are at least  at least  arguable? what about a third rule, the rule of lenity?
is anybody  is anybody working for the state a law enforcement officer?
that is correct.
well, he's saying two things. there is probable cause to believe that what we're calling the triggering event will occur, and there is probable  and when that triggering event occurs, there will be probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime may be found and seized at such and such a place. there are two determinations.
that's their backup argument, i think.
yes, but on  on that one, the  the second circuit said that he was incompetent, and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4) allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent. and if, in fact, the district judge is sitting there thinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a failure to write down his reason why it's excluded. i guess there's uncertainty here as to what reason was the district judge excluded that time, and it's a little bit hypothetical for the reason that justice ginsburg mentioned. but if you were to lose on the first point, then i guess on this point, the thing to do would be to send it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge intended to exclude on the ground of competency, in which case his failure was simply a failure to note down his reason, which is not required by the act.
but for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying kotteakos. and for the latter, however, you say we have to apply chapman. i just don't see the logic of that.
a tariff is also imposed by a state, isn't it? as opposed to 
well, justice stevens, congress has answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in response to a complaint, the school district to submit the proposed  the iep, the educational plan, it's adopted, as well as the other considerations  the other options it considered and why it didn't accept those other options. so, that evidence  and i think we're talking about the burden of production 
but it's never a question of the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?
well 
 one of the strange things about this case and the sec's position is that district courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position of paying a rather high cost, because if they are confronted with a removal of a case brought under state law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted under slusa, and the sec hasn't taken any action at all, and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit whether or not this is within the sec's enforcement authority. so, you have  ordinarily, you would have private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side of the case as the sec, as the public enforcer. but, here, you have them at loggerheads. and the only way that the district court can properly figure that out, whether or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to cut back on the sec's enforcement authority, will  if you will  would exact an awfully high cost. i would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a rather unusual one, particularly where the sec isn't a party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a brief. and yet, district courts, in order to determine the preemption question here, are going to have to rule against the sec in order to give a private remedy  to recognize a private remedy under state law, or to cut back on a remedy under state law by holding that it is within the sec's enforcement jurisdiction. ultimately, what merrill lynch here is asserting is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain class of holders who do not have a remedy under federal law. and i would submit that, where any party is seeking to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what congress intended. and i would submit to you that, both with the language of the statute, the findings that congress made in the legislative history, congress did not express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of greater than 49 persons.
let me give you another example. there are search warrants for wiretaps, are there not?
what you're reviewing here is a ruling.
justice kennedy, he sent the clear 21 signal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening 22 man, and then he tied it all together with this comment. 23 and i think he learned a lesson from his prior  prior 24 crime, and that lesson was don't leave any witnesses. 25 don't leave anybody behind that can testify against you. 1 don't leave any eyewitness.
 some affirmative order 
i don't even have to lie about the hardship. i mean  (laughter.)
we're not saying it's not subject to the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling interest applies under the statute  just as under the first amendment itself, before rfra was passed, and the one is to replicate the other  the court  there were certain statutes, when the court looked at the way they operated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the court said that individualized exceptions would not be feasible. and there's no reason to believe, and every reason to disbelieve 
and that's the parity that congress has  that has been the guiding principle of congress' enactments in this area since 1882.
 by conscience 
okay. so what  but  but the line of reasoning is  is  now, there is a crime. let's call it x. all right? and what you're  what counsel says is it's the law of mississippi that if there is a crime and it's x and it's lesser, you've got to charge it if somebody just says, please give me a lesser-included instruction, even if he's all mixed up as to what the right crime is. i don't know if that's the law of mississippi. from reading the mississippi supreme court opinion, i would say it wasn't the law of mississippi because they say you're not supposed to charge people in ways that would mix them up. but, i mean, anyway  but that's the argument. so what's the response?
absolutely, justice 
so your arguments about why the d&x is safer than feet first, wouldn't that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as well? in other words, if you want as much of the fetus intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the fetus?
well, that's what we were about to go to trial on, your honor. that's a merits issue. the ninth circuit has abstained on whether there was a mandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and i urge the court not to  to dive into that pool. we're trying to get in the courthouse doors.
right.
and in the last year or so, after we granted cert in this case after these decades of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it up.
perhaps you can explain. this was not your suit originally. you intervened. right? this was started out by the water district.
didn't  was  he was on the premises?
any authority?
 be necessary here.
and  and, your honor, we initiated a process. it is our new policy 111-07, which the district court and then the circuit court ultimately ruled on, where we made 
no. as being outside the statute at that time, and you did.
 there are several things that we would fall back on, your honor. when you say "fall back," i assume that that means if the court were not to follow the precedent of the trilogy 
it doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? does it mean any suit in the universe? any suit in the world? any tort suit? i would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.
with respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have  that  that's subject to clearly erroneous review. on the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact 
unfortunately, i'm not, your honor.
well, do you 
but not for release.
i'm sorry, your honor?
you know, powerful is part of the problem. this  this kind of telephone call evidence is even more powerful than  than the kind of a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it was testimonial. i mean, to hear  to hear the voice on the phone makes it, if it is  if it is impermissible under the confrontation clause, it makes it even a more damaging violation than the kind of violation that  that occurred in  in sir walter raleigh's case, for example.
a published dissent by a special trial judge? not that i'm aware of. but the point is the court of 
may i interrupt, general madigan?
no, it did not.
your honor is correct, and i am confident that when the officers returned with the search warrant, with the officers already inside, they did not knock and announce when they when they returned with the search warrant.
(a). they could have said (a), and they didn't. they said all of 3730.
that's a real case, and i'll give you the cite. people v. banks, 2002 westlaw 192, 720. there's another case cited in our brief, aid and abet robbery, natural probable consequence, sex offenses, that's the people v. nguyen case. another example, a person who has the intention to aid and abet battery, beating someone up, can be held guilty for an unintended robbery. and to show how stark this is, this is in california, it's broader than even the common law.
and 
when you're talking  when you're talking about sending designs over or blueprints or management instructions or a high level version of, gee let's have a code that will perform the following functions, and you have people design and make and compile and test and debug that code overseas, of course that component, the component is the object code, the precise commands that reside in the computer and continually interact with the hardware of the computer in a way i'm going to describe and is not disputed, millions of times a second. let's take this case. okay. is it  the question is, is it a component and whether what was supplied was in fact combined. that's, that's  that's what this case boils down to. as to the component. we have something, software program, the netmeeting and sound recorded program that can in its object, its machine readable command form, is developed, bought and sold entirely separately from any hardware that it commands.
at common law  at common law, yes. as this court has recognized in reformulating the common law principles of  of immunity, the  the public prosecutor now has absolute immunity under  under these 
the opinion of the office of legal counsel, in '78, was exactly what the petitioner here would urge.
when i was working on the first options in those cases, i thought there was from southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself. if he says that's not valid, that probably goes to the court, unless there's some other special thing. but if what he's doing is attacking the rest of the contract as illegal, that doesn't. that goes to the arbitrator. now, i really did think that was the law. and even if i was wrong in thinking that was the law, it seems to me the whole community, the whole business community in the united states thinks it's the law. everybody else thinks it's the law, and the briefs on your side don't even say that it isn't the law, except for yours. they say go and overrule the cases that make it the law.
it would be a different kind of case, your honor.
it would be an involuntary statement under the second 
and so, we'll get a notion of what it looks like.
justice scalia, i think i'm fairly characterizing the government's position when i say that as a constitutional matter, they say there's no sixth amendment violation until we see what happens at the trial.
where is evidence of abatement in that case that was before the jury? so that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show mercy? and if you ask them whether he is going to grow out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not going to sentence him to death.
no, not at all 
i think the answer, your honor, is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that they could never get out of the deal. certainly, they could repudiate and then go ahead and sue. but yet, at page 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the costs and risks of litigation. it is the reason 
with respect, isn't that also what the state is getting at when it says, "we don't allow diminished-capacity evidence in on mens rea, which is the state's burden. rather, we allow it in only on the defense of insanity, so that we can keep it clear, clear that unless the diminished capacity is so great as to amount to insanity, it's not an excuse"? and if that is what the state is doing, is there any  - anything unconstitutional about that?
mr. jett, a thought occurred to me, by reason of your agreement, that  that it's a one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in the  in the direction of favoring the defendant, it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that. but, of course, it can't change in the other direction because the constitution would prevent it. you sort of agreed with that. but  but if  if you agree with that, how can you explain our  our 1895 decision in davis which held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the government which was then overridden by a federal statute. how could  how could  if  if davis was right about what the  what the common law required, how could congress possibly have changed that by a statute? i would assume that all of the basic elements of the common law are picked up in the due process clause. why wouldn't  why wouldn't the necessity of  of proving the mental element of a  of a crime, even when that mental element is overcome by insanity, why wouldn't that have been embodied in the due process clause so that the congressional statute would have been ineffective?
i  i understand that. i guess the  the problem with that is that that means that no matter who they find  and in this case is a good example of it. they were worried that they might find the gang member who had a gun there, and that's what they were looking for. okay. and so they used the swat team. that seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a swat team the way they did. and they went in and within literally 4 or 5 minutes, they had  this is a tiny, little house. they had cleared the house. they had figured out all the occupants. they put them in a room completely under their control where they couldn't get away from anything. they knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie, and  and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot 
every party who prevails on a motion to admit evidence or to exclude evidence is promoting the policies and the rules of evidence, but we don't think that those motions should result in a  in fee shifting.
let's use the words "best buy." best buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and somebody opens up a shop, say mark's, that says, "mark's, he has the best buy." he wants to advertise on radio, "come down to mark's electronics for the best buy - for the best buy in consumer electronics, go to mark's," and he keeps using those words "best buy."
you may finish.
the complaint alleges an antitrust violation. just that there was agreement to engage in tie-ins, and an agreement not to 
what does the sixth amendment have to do with the selection of the sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? how can there be a sixth amendment violation if either the guidelines or our case law says military service is or is not a relevant factor? i don't see how that has anything to do with anything that you can get out of the sixth amendment.
so wouldn't it be more accurate to say that it's protected the right to be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to unreasonable search and seizure?
 to the extent that that could happen, and i suppose it could, the  again, the limitation is it be, as your honor states, for a valid law enforcement purpose, and it would require 
he may be able to aver generally but with specificity there are many cases in which he won't be able to. but the michigan department of corrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to maintain these records for future foia requests, and in many institutions it has to track them in a computer. and as justice ginsburg pointed out, in the jones case, they were quite able to bring forward the proof of exhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied the court that jones had exhausted his administrative remedies. jones gets, just got thrown out of court, essentially, in a game of "gotcha," because he hadn't attached his complaint in the first instance. i think most importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint, making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense. that means that the lawyers in the state attorney's general, in the state, in the office of the state's attorneys general, are going to be able to put forward the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not exhausted.
 i didn't say they had a 
it would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.
so, in other words, you're saying that that provision of the later statute that says, "go get them on social security," implicitly reads into it the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.
and it's a very bad  i think in the long term in the broad category of cases, it would be a very bad solution for defendants, because what's going to happen, once a court's determined there's no error at all, it's much easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there was it's harmless. and if they did that and then it turns out there was an error, you're going to be back here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless error decision because they thought there was no error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully. i would say the way they approached it in this case is the more desirable way. if you don't think there's an error don't go on and decide whether it's harmless or not in the abstract.
you don't need to say it. i understand.
but your starting place was the plan that was compulsory, that was forced on the school district in 1975? that is basically the same kind of plan?
would you describe the hypothetical justice stevens posed to your, your brother, would you describe that as just aggressive bidding? aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good term when you're talking about competition. but what if it's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival can afford?
yes, yes, and that's her testimony 10 at ja506 to 508. she says, we received it in discovery 11 and i had it and i've looked it, but i didn't have it with 12 me at that moment.
if  if he requests that the union take the grievance to arbitration and then to the flra and the union refuses, our position would be that he could then file suit in federal district court under the administrative procedure act on his constitutional challenge alone. that is, we think on the one 
what does the word "diversion" mean in this context?
indeed, your honor, but if their argument was correct, that the civil action bundled the claims, as they suggest, then zahn was wrongly decided. then the amount in controversy in zahn was the totality of all the claims. in other words, to preserve zahn, which concluded that the civil action word means an individual analysis of every claim within it, to preserve that conclusion, they have to argue the opposite conclusion that the words, civil action, mean all the claims are aggregated. the problem with that argument is that the historical practice of this court 
did the opinion make a point of that?
and two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.
that if you  that in other words, if you gave someone a lower salary 
yes. because that's a normal appeal period?
all right. let's say it's privileged access.
do you  do you not rely on that standard 
whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of an investigation. you want somebody to go to jail on how a jury decides that question.
there were the thousand dollars, but i think it went down as low as $250 in 
so your  but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a u.s. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race.
no.
no, i think there would be standing.
that's right.
no, no, no.
exactly. thank you. (laughter.)
when? when the judge says something, when he writes something? when does it become final? at what point in time?
no, for two reasons. the first is  i just want to be clear, we are not challenging the fcc's authority to have created the regulatory regime it did under 276. so the fcc could well have picked, as it did, long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here. but the reason  but the problem with saying that  i'm sorry. i lost the train of thought in your question.
 in  suppose a person bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place, and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then, subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price falls a lot, and he sells it. does he have a claim, under federal  ordinary  you know, does he  can he go into federal court?
it seems implausible on  you know, 
well, that's not really fair. the petitioners, as i understand it, both concede the discharges that make their way into the navigable waters would be covered.
the new york state police were in there. new york state managed the lands.
the factual situation is going to be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have the opportunity to do as much business in michigan as the intrastate carrier.
that's right. it can be reviewed and the attorney general's certification is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.
in that  in that case, we were construing the word age and age definitely has a different meaning from sex or  or race.
that is correct, your honor; but they have said that they have put off making a judgment based on impermissible grounds. while epa's explanation is difficult even to follow, one overarching point shines through and that is the agency does not agree with taking a regulatory approach regardless of how it might otherwise come out.
but are you saying it would also include state trafficking offense, because it's described in the word "trafficking"?
well, they would have to set out the overt act and the essential facts that constitute the overt act.
no other company in the country would do this, justice kennedy. this is an extraordinary case precisely because 
i agree with you. i'm trying to think of some theoretical case where it would make a difference. i can't quite come up with a hypothetical.
were there any votes in favor of the en banc rehearing?
thank you, counsel. mr. verrilli.
the rule speaks about the mandate should issue when cert is denied, but in this case, there was a further extension while this court was considering a petition for rehearing. do you say that that was also outside the rules so that the mandate would have to issue when cert is denied even if there is a petition for rehearing and a request to continue the stay during the pendency of that rehearing petition?
and 
well, the quote that you just gave says that there are express uses of age and there are non-age reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age, for example, the hypothetical that justice scalia gave with mr. goldstein, saying, well, i wouldn't want to hire someone who's going  who tells me they're going to retire a year from now. but if he said i'm not going to hire you because you're 64 because i know you're going to  people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind of non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a decision-making criteria. that's what that quote is referring to. if you  if you  the second half 
sure. and  and he was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case, this is what happens. it seems to me all you want us to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic paragraph about there are four factors and here they are.
you say there was a case in which, without any special reason, they did 
but the judgment of this court was simply reverse, wasn't it?
i thought what the 
why?
if  in terms of  to go to artuz' analysis, you would have to look at each  the exceptions are  go claim by claim. you would have to look at each claim and see did you plead the exception for this claim, yes or no; this claim, yes or no. so again 
 issue. and, in fact, the arizona supreme court, in walton, interpreted the arizona statute to require that aggravators outweigh mitigators.
 that's the nub of the case 
have we ever identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?
okay.
that would be correct.
 let me tell you the problem  the problem i have in the case 
i don't think it is an issue of texas law, your honor, because the basis for the finding that it was inadequate was that he had to separately object to the nullification instruction as opposed to what everyone agreed he object to, was the inadequacy of the verdict form. that was his federal claim. and our view is that the misunderstanding of the nature of the federal claim was what led the texas court to conclude that his objection was inadequate. i'd also like to 
but that was a factual matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was present at the time. and he didn't think it was in the heat of anger. he did think that it was a valid waiver. now, you're raising a totally different issue. you're saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all the elements of mitigation that the waiver might embrace. that wasn't the argument you were making here.
yes.
well 
if you make it abroad, that  and it's  that is where the component is supplied from. copies are made abroad. there's no question about that and 
no, it is not, your honor. and with all due respect, this court has consistently held that words used in one place in the statute should mean the same thing as in other places in the statute. coverage and benefits, as it's defined in this statute, does not include reimbursement claims, and to stretch that preemption clause 
yes, your honor. and to put it in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.
pineapples, we  what about those?
the trial court certainly looked at the defendant's evidence.
that's where your argument is going.
why is that any more attenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in maryland using american assets to do the evil deed in canada?
well, no, i'm not talking about textually. i'm talking about in structure. there's nothing in the structure that has anything to do with bridges.
but wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates federal rights, that federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights? and they didn't do that here.
you're using the phraseology interruption, and i would, would 
did deshaney stand for the proposition there could never be an affirmative duty to intervene, under what you're talking about the constitution here?
 but as i interpret your argument, you're saying that there is some merit, some benefit, to avoiding the state administrative procedures. what you're saying is that, "you know, these" 
let  let me ask you this. your  i think you say that you  you cannot extend the period for issuance of a mandate after the supreme court has denied the petition. could the court then issue the mandate and then recall it under calderon?
 federal court.
why doesn't  don't 1, 2 and 3 do the same thing?
isn't a change in the hours that a person works a change in the terms and conditions? you change your  somebody's shift from the day shift to the  to the night shift, isn't that a change under 703?
 right?
what we  what had happened is  is whenever the  whenever the death warrant was signed on november 29th, that put into play florida rule of criminal procedure 3.852(h)(3) which then entitles us to more records that we are not entitled to before a warrant is signed. at  at that point, we filed our records request, and the trial court, indeed, put forth their order as to when everybody was to respond and have various pleadings in. we 
wouldn't the fetus be  i think it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.
 or intentionally not adding new language.
sure. i'd be happy to give a number of examples.
what happened to b.c. hydro? because as i understand the district court sent that party back, too.
that there's no external  there  there will be no public knowledge of that information, that they can explain their  they can apply their process internally, apply the need-based process internally, and that will not be litigated in the courts if they assert executive  or state secret privilege as to that, and we assume that they would at that point. but we  we agree 
well, i guess it depends on the degree to which the regulations apply to the national banks. that's my only point, is that state laws apply to the same extent to the operating subsidiary as to the national bank.
 would all be responsible for creating a hazardous condition on the porch.
no, there isn't. they're all punished the same. so it's not as though this was a  a lesser included or anything like that.
but they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, your motion for a new trial is untimely. it seems to me the same as in this case. the judge said: your motion is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much later. fine. if the judge had said, your motion is untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of appeal in sooner rather than later. similarly, here the judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later. if the judge had done right and said the 14-day period, then surely mr. mancino would have filed within that period.
what  what case do you have that says that?
you do.
is it your view the entry was lawful or unlawful, in this case?
or again, it may be more efficient to have them aver generally, but as far as having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading requirement, we don't think that that makes sense. we are talking, again we are talking about prisoners here.
mr. nathanson, thank you. the case is submitted.
what  what do you mean by a  just so we get our terms defined, what do you mean by a nongeneric burglary statute 
it remained in effect. the  the fifth circuit has come to that conclusion that  that if  unless the court of appeals takes a contrary action or this court takes a contrary action vacating the stay, that stay remains in place until the case is out of the federal court system. because this case never became final, as the advisory committee notes made clear  and we think that the cases that we've cited in the brief are largely undisputed on this point  a court of appeals decision is not final until it issues its mandate. even the state in the blue brief concedes that's true. and so the question in this case really is, if you still have jurisdiction over a case, under what circumstances can you correct an error? and i think the miscarriage of justice standard is just way too harsh of a test under the circumstances because this case is a perfect illustration. there are overwhelmingly persuasive reasons for the court of appeals to have fixed its mistake in this case.
it was recognizing that when you are speaking "as a citizen," juxtaposition to "as an employee," then you do have first amendment rights.
thank you, mr. chief justice. (laughter.)
perhaps you should go on now to the question, assuming that it is immediately appealable.
well, what happened in this case was there was an effort to rehabilitate. the trial judge actually became quite energetic in trying to explain to the juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying that you couldn't possibly consider 5 years. but  and that was true with respect to white jurors as well as african american jurors.
i  i disagree, justice souter, that  that we're asking for anything like a huge, new body of law or that the third circuit was making a huge, new body of law.
well, i thought you were also making a different argument. i thought you were making the argument that they have, by their pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that they don't have enough facts to support a general allegation. i thought you were saying that because of the preface that you began reading, that in view simply of the fact that they are not competing, and in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the act. so i guess my question is, would your position be different if there were no allegation simply of an absence of competition and parallel action if  would your position be different if they had simply alleged, as justice stevens emphasized, that here were these parties and they had  they had taken some action, not specified, which resulted in violation of the act?
we said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception.
on the matter of policy, i would  since  if you  if you've said basically what you want to say in your argument, i would appreciate your devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to agree with. but suppose i were to assume that a state is not free, through the device of defining what's good medical practice, to gut the act  that is, to really make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal  because they disagree with congress's basic judgment that it should be illegal. that could happen.
do you want us to reverse that?
justice stevens, may i respond?
or a boat?
that is what the california supreme court has said.
yes, your honor. there  there was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being aware that the judge was going to, at some point 
well, what was the  what in your opinion  this is why  as you can see, i'm concerned about buttons. i think they're probably a problem. i think all judges are concerned about them. but then i think about this particular case. and i look at that single sentence: "it was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief." i mean, suppose this had been a different case. suppose the defense in this case was the defendant smith didn't pull the trigger. it was an unknown person called jones. then if i were on the jury, i would look out, see the buttons, and i'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was smith. otherwise they wouldn't be here with those buttons. i could think that. but this isn't that case. this is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger. the only question is whether the family's son came at him with a machete. so when i look at the buttons, i'd think sure, they don't think the son came at him with  i mean, they don't think that. he's their son. what would you expect them to think? so that's why i thought that they are saying that sentence, in this case. in this case, it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more.
do i correctly understand, we don't need the statistics, i guess they're not available, but in your view if we did have statistics and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the category of crimes across the nation, there was this risk, that would be enough?
 amici.
just because there's no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't mean the agency can't regulate that particular area, right?
it  it is true that all the polls say that there's public disaffection and cynicism. does that translate into action to defeat incumbents who take particularly large sums of money? is there  is there statistical evidence to show that?
and once you're in that situation already, as these prisoners are, and they're still not conforming their behavior to the prison rules, you have a limited number of options for trying to get them to do that, and your response to my first line of questioning was that there's nothing else you can think of that they could do.
all they want is a definitive appeal that this is really china, all right. now, can they do that, yes or no? you said yes. so i thought justice kennedy's question was, if they can do that, why can't powerex appeal in exactly the same way on the question of whether they're an organ. what's the difference?
well, you don't  you don't have to bring them simultaneously. you can bring the individual action first, separately.
you're saying the state should sue here.
no.
it's the great limburger cheese robbery. (laughter.)
mr. joseph, can i ask you to go back to the beginning for a second?
but they're not identified easily 
okay.
mr.  ms. grunder.
i  i agree that it's an unusual system, but i think it  and in a sense the same situation would have been present in webster v. doe, that is, the court, when it came to review the merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn't have had any possibility of deciding the case on a non-constitutional basis because non-constitutional challenges would be foreclosed. now 
i think there are several reasons. first, this court's decisions make clear that while includes may be construed as exclusive, if it appears alone, when congress employs the means/includes structures  structure and introduces some definitions with the word means and others with the word includes, that choice of verb should be taken as advertent, and the court shouldn't likely conclude that congress simply used the terms as interchangeable. second 
i don't have any statistics on that, your honor. but even if it were only five or six months, that would 
excuse me? no, i don't understand that.
and was there evidence at the recent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers relied on the fact that the judge thought stumpf was the triggerman and the murderer?
 obviously covers it.
could you 
but isn't there a wrinkle to this? isn't the wrinkle that even in cases in which you and i might say patently he's going to be out of time if he goes back to federal court, the third circuit is requiring him to go there anyway, go through the formality of formal exhaustion, if you will, before they'll consider it? and isn't that a basis at least for equitable tolling?
 he submitted a motion to remand to  back to the trial court, saying there's a vienna convention violation 
which fork? and i put the reason why. your opponents will argue, it seems plausibly, take the second fork because we have the suspicious circumstance.
well, if it's not a directed verdict, then a fortiori, then every analogy works against you.
let me try to hit a couple  [laughter.]
of course, the  the instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the molecules. they tell the jury that the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.
that's right. lamagno was about whether the certification was reviewable. your honor is also correct about the facts of that case. one of the points of dispute between the government and the plaintiffs there was whether mr. lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and, and the attorney general certified on his understanding that mr. lamagno was not drunk. and that was upheld by the district court on remand after some discovery and summary judgment type litigation.
 to  to prove the mitigation? and yet, the court upheld that even in the equipoise situation.
no. i think that the cold cell case clearly is a conditions of confinement claim. and let me explain to you, justice breyer, if i may, the reason that the identification of an alternative is so critical. it is the identification of an alternative that renders the claim the functional equivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because a conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily predicated on the assumption that the prisoner will continue to serve exactly the same sentence, even if the claim is successful. in your hypothetical, if a prisoner claims that his cell is too cold, the necessary implication is that the prisoner will be able to continue to be imprisoned at some higher temperature, even if the prisoner does not specify in his complaint that he wants to be held at 70 degrees or 72 degrees. and that is the reason why the identification of the alternative is so important.
your honor, in a review  if a tax court judge  most tax court cases are tried by tax court judges. tax court judges are trial judges, and if a tax court judge tries a case 
using that analysis, it's hard to figure out, but again the government had this obligation or we submit the government had this obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary to be any more dangerous.
even if it was for the sole purpose of driving the company out of business in order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?
i understand that. but we have alleged that as fact, justice ginsburg, and that fact and that allegation has to be treated as true under conventional pleading standards for purposes of a motion to dismiss. if we are unable to prove that fact when we get to summary judgment 
yes. that would be one easy 
well, your honor, i would argue that it would have to be a court in the  in the circuit in which the prisoner would be filing the 2255 motion because that 
he could have taken that one item and under a decision like hartman vindicated it. but as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these individual things and then concluded, as we explained in our brief, that it was taking years and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars more than was involved in each individual one, that was hopeless.
i take it  i take it that one of the answers to the observation that the federal court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's not true with respect to the exhausted claims. the  the petition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and as to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains open.
 court actions. official
i mean, how does the 
but all that the jury found was deadly weapon because that's all they were asked to find.
i'm sorry. what have juries been determining?
the  the word vessel does appear in the longshore and harbor workers compensation act.
 he could  he could make that argument.
do you know why they stopped funding it? why did  because i think that's been reenacted every year. no money for this. why  why did congress stop funding it?
because if you have that, we then have a new gothic jurisprudence where we're reviewing discretion on a collateral issue.
i guess i'm not quite sure what that means. i mean, it's one thing to say i will pursue the litigation because it would be a good thing to have a definitive answer from someone other than the governor or me. is it her position at the present time that the position of her predecessor is correct or not?
yes, but 
is  is an affidavit from the candidate enough credible evidence in your view?
but the  the only issue is who has to prove that. i mean, you  you could find out who their customers are in  in discovery and  and go to their customers and then, you know, show that all of the customers are dissatisfied and wouldn't buy  wouldn't buy the machine  wouldn't buy the ink were it not that they needed the machine. i mean, it's just a question of  of who has to prove it. that's all.
if you say the congress of the united states has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. that has happened.
well, in both circumstances the answer would be no, and in both circumstances i think the relief that would be accorded 
i thought not.
it's framed in terms of a  of a right. page 2 of the brief 
well, your honor, all costs are subject to the general requirement in rule 54 of reasonableness, and 
are they written out anywhere we can see them? or are there articles on this?
 one of the questions?
yes.
but when you speak of estate plan, you are  you seem to be talking in global terms; i.e., that there could have been no other disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of the decedent except those which the texas court is recognizing, the trust, the will. is that what the texas court does, or does the texas court say, the will is good, the trust is good?
your honor, the 
so, the  california's holding on "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" in its engert case, which is cited in these briefs, pre-dates this court's holding in maynard that "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" was invalid under the eighth amendment.
my principal argument is under 2(a), but if i fail on that, i think they fail under clayton act, section 4, as well. and 
 are at issue.
do you  do you take the position that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff  i'm sorry. let me find it.
but it is  it is also a  section 3000 of the california penal code says every prisoner gets parole. it is imposed on the prisoner as 
but  but following georgia and ashcroft, isn't  isn't that a possibility that we should consider as a satisfaction of what has come to be known as the  you know, the first of  of the gingles factors?
which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant? a, the case where the argument is a burden of proof should be on  on the  the state as a due process matter or a common law matter in an insanity defense and, b, in a duress defense?
 unless i'm missing something in your argument, everything you are saying in this argument could have been said with respect to that ad and, as justice breyer said, to a couple of others.
why is that  why is that legitimate? why should a lawyer  i mean, i presume no defense lawyer tailors his  his guilt phase representation without a thought to what is going to happen at the penalty phase if they get to the penalty phase. and so i  i have difficulty in saying that there should be some kind of a firewall for analytical purposes between guilt and penalty when  when we're in a  a question of cronic or strickland.
would necessarily have? you could have said that ex ante?
well, you could look at the  you could look at the outside and say, i'm not going to sign for this, and it's unclaimed.
i believe that this court's decisions indicate the following position. when a state files a proof of claim, it exposes itself to the trustee's defenses to that claim. so, in other words, if the  if the  if the preferential transfer was part of the same transaction or occurrence 
counsel, if we were to agree with you on any one of the three questions, would that end the case?
could you do that as a class action?
i understand that other step, and i think that was largely resolved in cannon v. the city of chicago, a decision which this court upheld a right of action to enforce title ix, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by congress, as this court  every member of this court recognized in  in sandoval.
where was she living before?
that is correct.
respectively.
that is what's handwritten on the original documents. that's it.
thank you, counsel. and mr. stewart.
no. actually the subcommittee report said we did, of the federal courts study committee.
i mean, in terms of speculation about congress's motive, i think you're very likely right that the reason congress added a specific reference to groups of individuals was that they were thinking in terms of mob families or syndicates, criminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal entity. they're not incorporated, but they function as unit. and they had those in mind, and they intended  they wanted to make sure those were covered even though they were not discrete legal entities. and i think you're likely right that the reason they didn't specifically include groups of corporations is that they didn't have them in mind as likely sources of trouble at the time. but that doesn't answer the question whether they intended to exclude the coverage of those alliances if they would otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the term enterprise. and if it came to cause the 
you mean that  that the injured party has to be the target?
yes.
they were  they were making notations of things like that, as i understand it, and they didn't have to worry about batson there. but there does seem to be a correlation with the manual.
doesn't.
zero. there is not one word about vessel 
well, the uniform view of the lower courts is that when the certification is overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee as the defendant and it proceeds in federal court as a pendent claim. the attorney general's assertion of the defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable because we presume regularity by the attorney general, confers article iii jurisdiction on the courts, even though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected. this court held in the carnegie-mellon case that the district courts have discretion whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent claims once the federal question has been resolved. if the courts have official discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then certainly congress can instruct them to exercise that 
i  i'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. i do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. we would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and  and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the 
that was part of the record on appeal.
well 
no, i 
can i ask a rather probably sort of stupid question? but i gather there are a large number of these cases disposed of by a postcard. would there be anything wrong if the california supreme court said, "we're going to have two postcards. one says that 'the delay was unreasonable, denied'; and the other said, 'there's nothing to the merits, denied'"  you use two postcards  wouldn't that solve all the problems?
 just 
well, let  let me ask  ask you this. knowing what we know now, we have the record, we have the benefit of hindsight, we know the evidence, in your view now what would have been the closest lesser-included offense for which an instruction might have been sought?
the way that would apply 
it ran with the land, it was part of what he brought. if it had expired 
 ineffective 
that is correct. and we think 
well, as far as that's concerned, she did testify that there was a car out there.
your honor, this court has always held and reiterated in the munsingwear case that where a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has been fully and finally litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction between the same parties, that the availability of an appeal 
okay, fine.
i think "waiver" might not be the right word.
not if  not if the tax  if the special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations, withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.
that's a very low standard in the first place, and why should it be watered down more?
no, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. that's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what congress intended by using the word  the words in this statute.
that's correct. that's correct.
well, i believe that the enforcement of the order flows from the probable cause determination. the obligation to enforce is triggered by a finding of probable cause of a violation. so the process we're looking for involves the probable cause determination. it's our position that by simply ignoring that process, you're depriving somebody potentially of their property right in enforcement of the order.
i  i don't know the answer to european law on charging of an additional price, but i would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, do go to the structure of the vessel. and we're talking here fundamentally in the ada about structural changes that they want to impose that go  when ships travel, they can't dismantle those structural changes when they leave u.s. waters.
i thought it was a joint explanatory statement.
where  where do you think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's case?
yes.
yes, certainly.
that's correct, your honor. there  there are situations 
why don't you do it the easier way and 
what  what is new york relying? i mean, they  somebody  does  does the state or the federal taxpayer rely on everybody who files a return that they  they filed it honestly? is that  that  i don't understand the sense in which a taxing authority relies on the return that's been filed.
i will  i will have to allow respondents to speak for themselves to that question, but as far as i'm aware, that is not in dispute in these cases or in any of the cases that have been litigated that  that but  that but for the alternative minimum tax, the way this would have been handled is that there would have been a miscellaneous itemized deduction under section 212 of the code for the cost incurred in producing income, and that the alternative minimum tax, along with, by the way, a large number of other perfectly valid deductions, get disallowed under the alternative minimum tax.
that's correct, your honor. but wachovia bank and wachovia mortgage made a choice. they made a business judgment to create a state-chartered operating subsidiary.
i'd like to reserve the balance of my 
what  what is the statutory equipoise provision?
yes, but that's not the facts of this case. isn't that correct?
yes, sir.
well, i mean, that may speak about where the aclu is going. i don't think it speaks about where this court is going because this court hasn't adopted that test. the test that this court adopted in mcfl would  did not get into that kind of inquiry. what it did is it focused on three relatively bright line factors about whether you accept corporate money, whether you have other sources of income from the corporation, and whether or not you were formed expressly for political views but without any sort of censorship or inquiry into what kind of political views. and that i think this court has found administrable.
your honor, the  what happened was that the utah courts found that the probable cause was there for the emergency aid exception, but i believe under the exigent circumstances requirement  or the exception, that probable cause was not there to get out  or actually to get into the home on the situations. but even if probable cause is conceded, the fact is that the facts of the case don't rise to the level of requiring such as immediate entry into a home to bypass the warrant requirement.
let  let me ask this question, if i may. suppose the  a special trial judge hears the witnesses, makes a report. it's assigned by the chief judge to a tax court judge, and the tax court judge looks it over it and says, you know, before i  before i really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't explore these three problems. would you please do it over again? is he permitted to do that or is that a violation of the rule that he shall presume the report to be correct?
but in  in reves  and if  and  and you  you may well correct me on this because i'm  i'm  my memory is not precise. but i thought in reves, in effect, what they did was to lie in the course of doing the sort of the thing that they normally do. here, the allegation is that they were doing something, providing phony id's, that employers don't normally do. isn't  and, you know, maybe that's a fine line, but is  is it not a fine enough line to get it out of reves and get it beyond the motion to dismiss?
is that right, or not?
but if the government is out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite different from the government having nothing to do 
counsel, you're ahead of me, and i'm still back on the last question, but i take it your rationale for not reaching these other grounds would also apply to your argument that whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the charging documents. that wasn't a basis for the ninth circuit's decision either.
your honor, again, i'm  i'm sure there's a compelling interest. the question is the least restrictive alternative. are we going to be able to meet every federal judges' view of is this the least restrictive way we could go about achieving this compelling interest? there's no doubt that prison security is going to be recognized as a compelling state interest, but the difficulty is the least restrictive alternative test.
may i ask you whether you would favor or disfavor our certifying the question whether there is a property right here to the colorado supreme court?
yes, but the bottom line from the other point of view is that shackles are always prejudicial, and you try to have the scales evenly balanced when you're deciding whether the man should die or not.
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
and i would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished.
i can concede that, yes, your honor, that 
well 
but wouldn't a jury think all this evidence must have some purpose? the only purpose it could have is to  is to propel us toward life rather than death. i mean, the bulk of the evidence at the sentencing phase  wasn't it?  was how he behaved when he was a prisoner before.
all right. so you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.
if you have an employer who says, i promise to give $200 a month per worker to a fund, which money will go to pay their health costs when they're sick, that's plainly covered.
i'm not sure i would 
but 
they  that  that was not their finding because in this case they actually recommended, whether or not anything occurred on the property, that the berms or barriers be removed. they actually recommend there be an interaction between the wetland and the ditch. that's the irony of this.
but then i would say then you're asking us to interpret civil action differently in two statutes.
no, your honor. he actually  the first petition raised only an ineffectiveness claim. the second petition raised a due process challenge to the colloquy, which was not exhausted in the first, raised new evidence to support the claim which pennsylvania law allowed him to do, and raised a constitutional and state law challenge to the legality of his sentence. there were new claims in the second proceeding.
i believe that's correct, your honor, because statutory pending contemplates a finality, it contemplates  and i think that this is, it is one of the fundamental problems, i believe, with petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only the plain language of the statute but what this court has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2). in duncan this court said that state, the word state modifies both post-conviction and other collateral review, and established that we are talking about a state application.
that's right.
i got you.
your honor, i'm not sure i can think of one because i come from a community with a long history of, of not doing that.
speech  and i don't mean to suggest it has no meaning, but "speech as a citizen" means speech that one can readily imagine a concerned citizen engaging in. you can imagine a concerned citizen coming forward to report race discrimination 
thank you, counsel. mr. phillips, we'll hear from you.
well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest. it wasn't what the officer had in mind but he didn't say anything. what result then?
justice 
so all  the evidence relates to the old policy which i think ohio recognizes was not adequate. and then there's  ohio has this new policy, and you, just on the basis of the written statement of the policy, made the judgment that it's not good enough.
very well, mr. utrecht. mr. waxman.
in  in this case, i thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost.
i was going to say it certainly had the meaning in federal  the federal court context set forth in section 1920 of the judicial code.
my reading is, she found, on the facts here, it was not cured.
yes, it is, justice o'connor. this is absolutely a requirements tie case. this is a case in which independent ink seeks to sell ink that is required to operate trident's printheads, their piezoelectric impulse ink jet printheads used to put carton coding directly onto cartons. and the requirement here  a requirements tie is that if you buy our good a, you need to buy good b that's a necessary 
 apparently deliberating 
but did it give notice of the reason for the reclassification? you did such and such. you are such and such kind of person, a gang member. does it tell him anything?
he joined 
what the presumption of correctness means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency determinations and the like, is that the burden of going forward is on the party seeking to change what  what  the determination that is presumed correct.
you talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question. it says no action shall be brought until administrative remedies are exhausted. and yet you say the action should be allowed to be brought even if there are unexhausted claims in the complaint.
i  i cannot comment on that, your honor, since that has not been the  the case 
yes, your honor. i'm 
let  let's focus on the word unusual. forget cruel for the moment, although they're both obviously involved. we've seen very substantial demonstration that world opinion is  is against this, at least as interpreted by the leaders of the european union. does that have a bearing on what's unusual? suppose it were shown that the united states were one of the very, very few countries that executed juveniles, and that's true. does that have a bearing on whether or not it's unusual?
your honor, i think the "sufficiently innovative" is more of a description rather than a test; it's a description of what this court said in graham. in graham itself the court laid out the proper analysis which is you need to consider in detail, not in the more cursory fashion that the federal circuit's test encourages, but in detail the capabilities of a person of ordinary skill and the content of the prior art and the differences between the prior art and the invention, and ascertain  it's ultimately a legal judgment informed by those detailed factual inquiries, whether it is obvious or nonobvious and entitled to patent protection. and in addition i would point out that this court in sakraida provided a framework for assessing patents like this one, where each of the elements is set forth in the prior art and each of the elements in the claimed invention is merely performing its already known, previously known function as set forth in the prior art.
mr. mitchell, what gives me pause is that there are mississippi cases  you no doubt know them  where the court has seemed to think that the federal issue under beck was discrete from the state issue. so i forgot the name of them, but one of them was striking because it says this doesn't run afoul of beck, and then it says, now we turn to mississippi law on lesser-included offense. and it  the  the state supreme court treated those two as discrete. so when you just say lesser-included offense, why should the court assume that you're talking about one rather than the other when the mississippi supreme court itself has made it clear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?
that's your argument.
we regulate advertising. we regulate commercial advertising.
no, i don't believe so, justice scalia.
well, how  maybe you just don't know the answer.
no.
moral judgment, from beginning to end.
well, should 
well, it is the report that was filed in the senate. it has a footnote that says we don't intend to overrule zahn or ben hur 
i would respectfully disagree, your honor.
well 
well, is the constitutionality of the president's action here before the court in this case?
i understand that. you're 1 repeating that point which  so i might ask this question 2 on this very point.
first, i 
oh, it would be. but, again, in the case that you're talking about, the very value that you're arguing for  i.e., "we ought to be able to rely on the notice that we have given"  is an argument which hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to make.
if the judge's response to juror hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?
i'm not aware of legislation, your honor.
absolutely not.
all right. now, is there any other claim  any other answer to the argument other than they waived it?
it would not be in the case that the funds are not under the control of the attorney.
i see.
we submit, justice kennedy, that the nature of the attorney-client relationship is fundamentally different from the types of relationships you cited, and that's because an attorney here is the one who's earning the income. it's the attorney who is making the critical decisions.
yes, because that was a case  that's the other one that i was thinking of this morning. that was a case that was filed in the district court and litigated in the district court. and it raises a real anomaly about whether or not this case even really presents the question on which you granted review because their  the theory that they have pursued in state court and at this round in federal court is that there is a takings violation under both the state and the federal constitution under the so-called substantially advances prong. their complaints allege a penn central violation, but their briefs in the lower court  in the lower federal courts in this proceeding and in the state courts don't discuss penn central at all, as the california supreme court in footnote 14 of its opinion explained. so if this is just a substantially advances claim, it raises the question, number one, whether in the context of legislation, there is a substantially advances prong in the fifth amendment, a question that you're  you're asked  that you are presumably addressing in lingle v. chevron. if there is, it raises the separate question posed by this court's decision in yee whether that is a claim for compensation. in other words, what this court said in yee is when you challenge, under the fifth amendment, legislation on the grounds that it doesn't substantially advance a legitimate government objective, this court said, that's not a claim for compensation. that is a claim that the ordinance be struck down and not applied. and that's what they're litigating here. now, they have  and so the question is if it's not a claim for compensation, is it subject to williamson county ripening? why should you have to go to state court? so there are a lot of this  the conference of state chief justices have filed an amicus brief in support actually of us in this case, saying we don't see that the facts of this case present the question on which you granted review. i think it's fairer to say it's not clear because the petitioners did challenge this ordinance not only on its face, but as applied. and although the district court below found that it wasn't a real as-applied challenge because they couldn't in any meaningful way distinguish themselves from the other 500 residential hotels in san francisco, all of whom are concededly subject to the hotel conversion ordinance. at least i suppose in theory, there is some claim for compensation for the temporary period in which they were subject to the hotel conversion ordinance. so i  i don't know. i  you granted cert in the case. we'd like to get the  the question answered, but i think the reason this long disquisition, justice kennedy, about del monte dunes is in del monte dunes, it was a substantially advance claim, and i think it was thought that there was no need to engage in williamson county ripening.
does scripps  is scripps in the business, too?
well, trying to use the court's words in taylor, taylor talked about that 
 what the whole argument is about, whether it has to be a felony under federal law. you're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under federal law, that you don't get 
well, but was this  was this case remanded for a new trial?
because under batson and then under purkett v. elem and under hernandez v. new york, this court has declared that batson is a rule of federal constitutional law, that the purpose of batson is to protect the sixth and fourteenth amendment rights of the jurors to equal protection and not being "perempted" for racial reasons. in 
so an officer who picked up the warrant would not be able to tell necessarily. if he said, hey, has somebody got the affidavit, they could have brought it forward and he could have found out. but if  if somebody didn't know where the affidavit was, he wouldn't have any way of knowing.
the instruction, again, is number 4 in paragraph 18 on page 
your honor 
it would not be murder.
we do, your honor. the  it is not  it does not happen outside of the reception center cell practice. once they get to their permanent housing assignment, they may choose their own cellmates.
well, that's  that's a better way to put it. if  if that's right, then what you're saying, as i understand it, is in those cases where an employer goes to an insurance company, they give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he gets sick in return for a premium by the employer  and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the most typical thing  you're saying all those  all those  there's no fifth priority. they don't  can't take advantage of that.
that is correct, your honor, but mr. stone did have direct and independent knowledge of his allegations. and i'd like to go back to the discussion with petitioner's counsel as to the jurisdictional petition in this statute. there is no question that 
an  an unloaded gun could be a firearm so long as it has the capacity to fire.
can i ask you sort of a basic question that i'm having trouble following? as i understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?
but your, your answer to justice stevens as i understand it was the police not have the duty to discontinue the chase? the obverse of that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e., prolong the injury to the public. i'm surprised at your answer.
 even though there is a warrant?
there 
look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it. the question is whether you can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to go through enormously expensive discovery, which  which isn't worth the candle.
my best analogy here is a private mine inspector who has the same duties as a federal mine inspector, which, in this case, who  you could say someone who contracted 
i think it's very odd to say that, in matlock, the right was relinquished, when matlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was never asked for consent, or that rodriguez relinquished his right by falling asleep in his own apartment. what really  i would qualify my statement, though, in response to your comment, justice o'connor. it's not that it treats it as nothing. it would treat her consent as 100 percent valid when he's asleep or absent, no matter how much we know he would object, and it would treat it as zero when he's on the scene and vocalizes an objection. and i think that that would protect fourth amendment rights only by happenstance, or, worse, it would simply be an invitation to the 
 as i remember.
well, does it drive the  i mean, it  it drives the lawsuit with respect to one element. and  and i  i guess one argument is if  if we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it will invite more lawsuits. they'll say, boy, the supreme court really means it with this presumption now. has that, in fact, been the case that the presumption, at least as it has been understood up to this point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has driven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even though the market power point was, of course, satisfied?
let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines  erroneously  that there was no constitutional violation at all. its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the state court conducted chapman or not?
justice stevens, this is not this case because this case was brought as a facial challenge. our entire act was struck down based upon that one potential 
that's  in the supreme court, that's right.
well, if  and i apologize if i was misunderstood. my 
mr. chilton, we'll hear now from you.
 because, even if incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable. and i'm just having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position is dictated by precedent under teague, a reading 180 degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this court as reasonable.
that's right.
well, but one of the reasons for the finding of  of incredibility was the decade or more of silence.
well, for malaysia international the desirable outcome would be upholding the third circuit opinion. it then gets remanded to the district court.
it wasn't the government in  in mullane it wasn't the government.
i take no position on that. it may or may not permissible.
 counsel.
well, the question is whether there was a present policy. that's the point the solicitor general makes in its brief and the point we make in our brief.
the state court could reconsider powerex's status as a foreign sovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any, implications in the state court because powerex isn't claiming immunity in this case. it's only invoking the procedural benefits of the fsia which include that the case be litigated in the federal court before a judge rather than a jury. and it would be forever denied the benefits, those important procedural benefits of the statute if this court doesn't uphold review of the 
you think i'm right just suddenly for the for the first time? you have thought of this?
thank you, mr. feldman. mr. draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.
your honor, i'm not certain. that's  i'm sorry. i'm not certain. i believe that it could be removable, still utilizing the application of the federal law to that circumstance, even in the factual dispute.
justice ginsburg, we believe it was appropriate for u.s. review because of the balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the case because of the bills of ladings. although the district court believed that chinese law would apply to the contract for the sale of the steel coils, in fact we would make the argument that with the various charter parties in the case, including the bill of lading that you reference, indeed american law would apply and there would be some different issues that would be evaluated.
because it seems to me that, conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the code, might well think, "well, this includes a 10-year limit."
what?
well, there is something special about the water, your honor, and that's what the court has recognized. the water is a state  an essential attribute of state sovereignty, and just to 
you think that's correct about what the court said in bayview when it phrased the question as before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries. that's what the court thought it was deciding in riverside bayview.
assume that it's a very weak case. they settle for 20 cents on the dollar. do you have the right, as you understand the law, to insist that you receive 100 percent of your payments from the gross settlement?
we're not even sure, are we, ms. sullivan, that  that you can extend, assuming that there is market power in the patent  we're not really sure that you can extend it through tying. i mean, there's  there's dispute among the economists even on that question.
that that  if you have that tough  which i haven't seen anywhere, but i mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess. but i mean, how much is written into those words official unjust and unreasonable? i'm certain you can't squeeze any rate  it is not the case that any and every regulation can be  fall within.
how can they do that with  with a party? i mean, the  and the reason  the reason i ask is it seems to me that you still have the cause of action left. maybe that would be my next question. suppose there's a settlement and you don't get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical specialists, plus general damages, and you're  you're unsatisfied. don't you still have the right under arkansas law  or do you  to pursue the tortfeasor for the balance that's owed to you?
i  i would certainly agree if we get to that point. but let's the lawyer does, as you at least left the door open for him to do, and  and he does proceed to represent the guy. the judge doesn't remove him and the lawyer continues to concede. do you  do you think that there is any possibility on a strickland analysis of finding adequacy of counsel?
and you think that's fully consistent with the north carolina case.
greater than not taking action. in other words, that the harm 
well, the  yes, the question is whether the jurors would reasonably understand the instruction to preclude the consideration of constitutionally  of relevant evidence.
in the  in a subsequent or nearly subsequent breath, the prosecutor then asked for the enhancement, the 36-month enhancement, that applies for firearms. i think what you're seeing there is that the prosecutor was responding to the  to defense counsel's use of the term element. and in  in the year 2000, before apprendi, before blakely, we never would have used that term as applied to a sentencing enhancement. we just didn't think of it that way. now, we have since changed our thinking, obviously, after apprendi. but i think if you  on the  on the overall point, if you look at defense counsel's comments beginning with the comments pretrial, where he notes that i can see no relevance to  to the admission of a different gun. then he comments, ms. recuenco was threatened with a 380 automatic with a clip. regarding the charge in particular, counsel at ja, page 30 says, the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under a theory of firearm. at ja 37, counsel said, the firearm is an element of this offense as it has been pleaded and argued to the jury and evidently, perhaps, obviously proven to the jury. so 
well, i think that would have been different. that would have been a disclosure prior to the  to the drop, and there  i would expect under pleading that the plaintiffs could have done, they could have tied the two of them together and argued that the cause of the loss was the combination of the two events in the marketplace.
may  may i just ask you a question about that? i realize that there is a predictive element. i don't think anyone disputes that. one of the points of contention here, as i understand it, is that even the new policy did not give a  an  an inmate a statement of the charge or reason for the  for the reclassification to 5. is  is that correct?
are you 
 at least.
i suppose that doesn't make the dissenters in blakely feel very good.
that is correct. and that is found in instruction number 10. and as we go through this process, you see that the kansas death-penalty law has a default to life in virtually every stage of the prosecution of the case. and then, instruction number 10 is a determination by the legislature consistent with this court's precedent, because we have narrowed the class of defendants who are eligible for death, consistent with furman and the concern for guided discretion. and then, we have allowed the introduction and consideration of all mitigating evidence. the juror is then told how to give the effect that they desire, after the reasoned moral decision, to that mitigating evidence. as defense counsel for mr. marsh, in the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66, volume 4  it is not in your joint appendix, but it is part of the record before the court  stated to the jury in closing, "the practical fact is that each of you will decide whether or not you believe death is the appropriate sentence. and if you decide that death is not the appropriate sentence, you have decided that the mitigators outweigh the aggravators." what instruction number 10, which is before you today, which states that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravating factors, is, is guidance to the jury on how they can give the 
okay.
now, why? okay. once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. so, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. that's what i would like to hear because to me, i'm not so moved by holistic as i am by purposes, which is part of holistic. so  so the  the point that i would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of ira's as pensions  i do. i think of it that way. i don't know much about it. it's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. but there is this extra thing in it which you point to. so why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?
 of course not.
well, but if we held the act was applicable for injunctive relief, it would  it would be, because i'm  the pert part of your argument is that you could have a attorneys fees and triple damages where trial attorneys levy against the state treasury, which is  which is what the eleventh amendment is largely concerned with. that  all of that would follow from what you've said so far.
no, but your point was that this is the core of the fourth amendment, and they're taking away all of the protection and leaving it to the unbridled discretion. and that turns out to be not the case. under the law that authorizes the procedure, the california supreme court interpretation is that the fourth amendment provides protection against harassment or arbitrary and 
we may  we may not have held they have a constitutional right to make that argument, but do you  do you think that state  that you did  you don't think they could even make the argument as a matter of state procedure or anything at all?
 the fees will be pre-petition.
well, i guess we've said you've got to do it with 
right?
well, as  as far as the difference in time, it was the secretary's decision, the later secretary's decision to retain, as you acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. you said it didn't go through notice and comment the second time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in 
so what is supposed to be disregarded are educational agencies?
 the direct answer to that last question is that all bets are off when what the government is doing is compelling the speech of a private actor, because the government is not allowed 
but mr. frey, we don't know what oregon law is on that point. they do have a law that the oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case. and how would you deal  would it be different if oregon, as many states, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some state fund?
 which would have  which would have handled the offset 
your honor, obviously it is not the facts of the seattle case. in the hypothetical your honor posits, perhaps the right analogy is something similar to the, a redistricting cases. where a court could look at see whether the racial motive was a predominant factor as opposed to 
it doesn't seem to me a very good rule to give to police forces: anybody who's going 72 miles an hour, let him go. or at least if he hits 90, let him go.
of such.
 would be within the  within the power of congress to reach.
i thought he came in after  after the jury had been selected.
does it  does the plea refer to the police report?
so the principle is there's a right not to be shackled, and when the state says that that right has to be compromised, then the state has to have the burden of proof?
if  if they don't pay the premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't cover the accident.
all right. now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 34.4(a)(b). neither existed. but we listened to what the agency said as a court and they explained how the regulation worked. would you expect to come to precisely the same result?
did this go through your  can i just ask 
 because 
 a statutory term that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.
it has not resulted in a disaster.
in the district court, mr. rita did put forward evidence of his military records, health concerns, he  the district court received that information. the district court did not consider that information because there's nothing in the record where the district judge weighed any of that information to determine what  what effect to give any of it.
that  that occasionally happens, and  and there are some cases clearly where there is a formal stay order in place if the court is acting pursuant to (d), which we 
but the situation that's presented here is identical to the situation that existed in mcnally v. united states, justice scalia. in that case, the question was whether or not an intangible rights theory of mail fraud could be extended to include nongovernment officials. that was the specific question presented in that case, and that's the  the question the court granted. and every court of appeals had interpreted that statute to say that intangible rights theories are valid under that statute. and  and that issue was not adverted to in the petition, and it was briefed in this court 
no.
but don't we have to do that anyway when  when in fact a person brings an ordinary claim? i mean, joe smith brings a claim that xyz company cheated the government. now, that doesn't mean it was committed. it just means he says it was committed. after all, he might lose.
but we rejected that as to post-'85 damages.
suppose it was faculty, and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in  on the faculty of every school, so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit. that's their objective and they're using a racial criterion criterion to get there. would that be impermissible, to have a mix of teachers in all the schools?
your honor, the purpose of the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a license to litigants to rely on district court errors.
no, no. their counterclaims.
thank you, mr. blume. ms. spillars, you have four minutes remaining.
 to the habeas statute.
well, i think the way we would try to articulate it is that if the way that the business model of the particular defendant is set up is that they are not involved in a business substantially unrelated from copyright infringement, that there should be liability in that situation. and i think in an extreme case like this, where over 90 percent of the business  and i think mr. verrilli correctly describes that it's not a minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent  because the only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence that there are such things as public-domain works.
no, your honor. the  the only question that has really been litigated below is whether section 1-104, which is the semi-closed primary law, is burdensome on the association rights of the libertarians.
the fact that the deadly weapon enhancement can apply specifically to a handgun regardless of the manner in which it's used. for instance, it  a  a handgun that does not have the capacity to fire could be used to  to strike an individual, and in that context would be a deadly weapon regardless of whether it was likely to cause a serious bodily harm.
 part of the treaty question that i had is also  this is a root that you are  and it contains dmt. and the treaty doesn't ban everything that contains dmt  for example, pineapple and bananas. the question is the ratio of the dmt to the entire plant.
you want to look moderate.
no, but the  as i understand the  the trial court, he accepted the probability that the knock would be futile, and yet he thought as a formality it was nonetheless required. a, do you understand the trial court to have taken that position? and b, if it did, do you believe that is correct as a statement of fourth amendment law?
is that right?
no, they are not told that they may search any parolee, your honor. rather, they are told that the search must be to rehabilitate, reform, or have some other law enforcement purpose. and they  -
the question is if 
is there any authority at all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or controversy requirement? i mean, it's one thing to say you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's a case or controversy. i'm  i don't know of any authority that says that you can  you can take a matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy and latch it onto something that does qualify.
let me just be sure i understand the hypothetical case, where, three times before, there had been warrants served, and, each time, the homeowner shot at the officer, the fourth time, they could go in without waiting.
and the patent holder chooses not to plead the license  chooses not to plead the license. wouldn't the patent holder have that option?
even in the  even if it's not a major personnel action?
and it shows both what they resell to the united states and what they acquired.
i sure would like that, but  (laughter.)
 coerced statement, in that event, it would be unusable for any purpose.
if the state court allowed damages  if  if the state system allowed  state law allowed damages, would the federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that  under the state statute?
but those states 
 what's going on 
well, how do you avoid  what about their statement from collier?
now you say the primary purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather than determine whether there is merits to the grievances?
what was weird about it, justice scalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself. and when congress 
i believe it had been. it was a tucker act provision. thank you. that would be the answer to your question, justice scalia. but in direct response to the question you started with, justice breyer, congress  the general statute of limitations for refund actions did already exist. in fact, the government believes it's significant when congress passed 7426, instead of referring to that specific provision, it placed in the same section of the code a shorter statute of limitations specifically for these actions. it created a new subsection and said 7426 actions must be brought within 9 months.
 the absence 
justice stevens, the  the issue of the statute of limitations i believe is dependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for remaining a viable method of seeking a refund. and my position is that if 1346 does provide that in the context of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory schemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh, 1346. it is true that they overlap in the sense that there is a refund provision that could be sought under either one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in that it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not offered under 1326.
in other words, the statute is  it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.
that in effect is saying we can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just going to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.
it could be 
i  i don't know the answer to that. i know that was the practice. in  in fact, pennsylvania courts still do that.
is that the only one, or are there other ones?
what do you say on the merits, then, to the claim that there were 300,000 of these acres in 1838 or with the treaty of buffalo creek  there were 300,000 acres that nobody was paying any attention to because there were no tribe members that lived there, so that when you have language in the treaty, under those circumstances, that says their home is now  where was it? illinois or 
no, no, no.
but this court has been clear that it only decides the issues that it speaks to. it's not plausible, your honor, that this court was deciding a major unresolved issue of federal criminal law without ever speaking to the question 
that is correct, justice scalia. and, justice breyer, the limitation for the officer is a significant matter. it is the only thing that gives him the 
"and i don't want to do that." now 
it would seem to me exempting distributor-to-distributor taxes just means that only one distributor has to pay.
no, it's not.
there was an allegation, your honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the company, but there was no allegation that y & h was an employer as the term is defined in title vii.
listen.
black is what excused the failure to raise penry i for novelty. and so it was clearly established state law at the time of this trial 
why  i understand that 
but mullane, as mr. kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people. this was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on that a goodly number of them would get notice and they were kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't. but here, we're dealing with a single individual.
i don't think you have to reach that question here. but you do have to reach a related question, i think, which is, i think the trial court here very clearly, in applying mott, prevented the petitioner from making a diminished-capacity argument. and then 
if the clear purpose and message was to honor the diversity of religions in texas, it would then be permissible. if it were a series of displays like that frieze, the fifteen different 
and i thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.
and, justice scalia, he also had to raise his voice, and our contention 
they have said now you should plead them at the petition  in the petition.
that's correct, your honor. but at the same time, there may be some other mistake or some other excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up. i mean, what congress intended to prevent is not just the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful revisiting, if you will, of the judgment. it  it intended to prevent the actual attempt itself. i mean, the idea is  is that once this judgment is adjudicated, once we've had this adjudication, you are not to come back. you are not to 
 your time is running out.
chief justice roberts, that's correct. and our view is that the court should deal only with the fobian rule. and the alternative argument which respondent presented was never argued below, was not decided below, was not presented in the opposition to certiorari. it's been rejected by every single court of appeals 
this is belt and suspenders, that's all. the  i don't think any judge likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver. this judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't waived it there's nothing there 
because  and this is the language that mr. phillips is referring to in steiner  4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the first principal activity, including on the theory that it's integral and indispensable. the first principal activity has to be something other than a walk, and that's what happens in this case. as in steiner, there is donning at the beginning of the day. that's part of the principal activities 
yes. it seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the  as the  the government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.
it's kind of an extreme position, isn't it?
not on labeling. justice scalia, every day 
well, let me ask  ask you this. as a  rather than presumptions, can we look at this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof? i  i take it the constitution does not require the state to introduce mitigating evidence. that's  that's the responsibility of the accused.
if that had been done, would travelers have asserted a claim?
yes, in section 3067.
that has occurred, your honor.
no, your honor. i don't think that's right.
answer the question, justice souter. yes or no.
and you  you agree with the government on that, that he can never get review of the statutory claim.
how about you? you're in trouble too, aren't you? (laughter.)
one of the things 
 a number of courts of appeals that have looked at this in the sentencing context over the years have concluded that it  that the absence of that language is very significant, and the presence of the language that says "any felony" is also significant.
unless you compel him to seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional claim, your  every incentive is to go right ahead with the trial.
they are voted on when the  when the conferees make changes, which they sometimes do. then  then, of course, they have to be voted on. so it's frequent. it's frequent that they're voted on, but this one apparently  there were no changes made and it wasn't voted on.
 for property  i'm sorry?
well, contract  i  you  you pointed out the  the terminology which includes contract damages or  or contract harm as personal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from that that every harm or every injury that is personal falls under  conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.
it's impossible to do in the abstract. if you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not. there has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years. and it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge  a driving fact in determining what's reasonable.
the  the question presented in this case  and it's the same question that was presented below  is whether the defendant corporation and its agents under these circumstances can constitute an enterprise.
ups does, i think, about 12 million a day; fedex, about 5 million.
don't  when i  when i go under this  this 49 u.s.c. 14504 and i choose a home state 
it is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.
i'm sorry.
no, your honor. section 1519 did not get passed until the year 2002. it did not exist. instead, the rule that was in force then was the pettibone rule, the one that's reflected in the text of section 1505; and that is, "the proceeding must be pending." that's, no doubt, why the government didn't charge andersen with a crime under section 1505. i mean, they make it sound like the culpability here is the destruction of records. well, if so, then you would think that they would have charged andersen with destroying documents 
at all. so it's not really vehicle-specific.
that would depend on the general rules for attributing a liability from a successful 
past defendants. they  they 
could it bring it up by a declaration of non-applicability? could the new company  how would it 
and the figure, the 250 million is for the rental  what is that  what is that for?
because there the challenge is to the discriminatory purchase. it's not about the prayer breakfast, it's about the idea that the government is purchasing bagels in a religiously discriminatory way.
would not do.
i think it is, your honor, but let me just say that that's a claim that he could have brought before the csrts, and that is a claim he can still bring before the military commissions.
and  and the standards under beck are different from the standards under the roughly comparable state rule, as i understand it, because under the state rule, the lesser offense need not be an included offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a  a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the federal standard, simply raising the state standard wouldn't do it.
so, therefore, it is not true 9 that he always has that year.
what about the telephone call between a husband and wife, and the wife tells the police, "listen in on this call"? she's consented to the monitoring of the conversation, the husband has not. maybe he even begins the call by saying, "i  don't let anybody else listen to this." it's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?
yes.
and, therefore, we'll get a force for improvement. and that's, i thought, maybe why nobody wanted, really, to bring it up.
it  it can arise again, your honor, and that 
yes. mr. linger.
but for different purposes. in the one case, in this act we're worried about an extensive federal presence that has an effect on the tax base available for schools and under the efig program it's an entirely different question of equalization.
well, that kind of  that begs the  that's not the question i asked and it sort of begs the question. i mean, you have the state law cause of action to enforce your contract claim, and if there's some state law that's asserted against you that's inconsistent with the contract, then you have the federal question issue. but that's the only federal question i see in the case.
the words, on account of, in this  this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. you may become eligible at a certain time. it would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. you may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.
but i think 
thank you, counsel. mr. frey, you have 2 minutes remaining.
or  or my uncle vinnie. what about the real  the real case of my uncle vinnie? there's 
what is different?
i'm sorry. the first part of your question i had trouble 
that's 21 c.f.r. section 312.22(a). it states that, "the fda's primary objectives in reviewing an ind are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in phase two and three, to help assure that the quality of the scientific investigation of the drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety."
that crime depended upon the validity of the wire fraud charges, because the crime was use of a gun during in relation to this wire fraud scheme.
 straight to california supreme court. which brings up one point, which is that the problem that we're looking at here in deciding timeliness will not arise in capital cases. we will not have that problem, because capital cases go straight to the california supreme court. there are not going to be intervals between the courts to deal with. so, that simplifies, i think, the problem a little bit. the other thing i'd like to address is the argument that a state court is saying something with these summary orders. i strongly disagree with that. they are absolutely saying nothing. this court said in ylst that the essence of an unexplained order is that it says nothing. it does not say, "this is a timely petition."
general clement, in two respects, it  i think you have addressed the cost concern by comparing, in your brief, the federal experience, which is subject to these controls, and you said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also pointed out that every state prison system is subject to the rehabilitation act, because they get federal funds. is there a difference between the obligation that state systems would have under the rehabilitation act and under the ada?
well, why 
uh-huh. the customer being the issuer?
it is not  it is not just party aggrieved. it's party aggrieved by the findings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by a denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as two different things.
mr. tribe, would 
two.
i think congruent means that it's equivalent. i think  i think the ninth circuit's view of an equivalent determination is that it's close. it's close enough for government work, perhaps. (laughter.)
yes, but there's a pretty frightening history about speech restriction too.
let me ask you a question just about what you  what you're assuming when you make the  the statement  prefaced the argument to the effect that there was a complete breakdown of  of the adversary process. you're assuming, i take it, when you say that, that the guilt phase and the penalty phase have got to be regarded as distinct and separate phases.
without the wesley evidence, i  i  at the initial trial, i certainly would concede that.
 clement, do i understand, with respect to that brief that offered a statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute that we now have? and if we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from the vietnam days, that  this would have been a highly academic question, because there weren't any such policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.
no. i thought i was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (laughter.)
oh, so it has to be known.
that is correct. in the interest of candor, i have to tell your honor that we sued the parent company to the mine operator, which is grupo mexico, in an attempt to assert a claim, and that case was resolved only by some  by making some concessions on the workers' compensation lien issues that the workers' compensation carrier had back against the claimants for their recovery from the state of arizona. i hope that's clear. but, generally, workers' compensation carriers have a right to get repaid if there's some private settlement, and concessions were made on that right, because of the  suing the parent company, and that case was never resolved on the merits. to begin, your honor, this came to the ninth circuit from a motion to dismiss. and that has significance to this  to this question, because the plaintiffs were not able to develop the factual record which goes to the issues of whether or not there would be liability under the state law  the good samaritan law or under  issues about assumption of duty under state law.
employed often by the state?
so there were at least two errors. how they balance out i guess is your view they didn't hurt him at all.
and is a screening.
i'm sorry.
if the debtor dies?
6 percent? thank you.
well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court. they did that with respect to the administrative proceeding, as justice ginsburg pointed out. they perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court.
it was a prejudgment attachment in aid of what could be accomplished administratively by, ultimately, an administrative judgment.
you cannot convert a law into a law directed at the first  at first-amendment rights, can you, by simply saying, "the reason i am disobeying it is to express  whatever, disaffection with the war, my objection to homosexuality, or anything else  or to homosexual discrimination  or anything else"? does that convert it to a law directed against the first amendment?
may i just be sure i understand one thing about that? so you're saying at the time he filed the petition on december 28, 1998, he had already had, the second judgment had already been entered by the washington supreme court?
i  i think it's definitely a fact that the court weighs, although here we have evidence that at least one ohio court took that possibility into account and said even in light of that fact 
it should turn on the candidate of choice 
i  i thought this  this was something you'd say, well, of course.
it's not? why did they file  is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the former prosecutors giving the propositions that i just stated and have the supreme court case next to each one? are they wrong, those prosecutors?
well, you said we could affirm if we applied cronic, but i thought the issue was whether perhaps strickland applied, and if strickland applies, i wouldn't think we'd be affirming necessarily.
drive prices down.
 what about the seventh circuit case that posed the question of same job, same character of work, except that the employee had flex time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just changed to  same job except it's got to be 9:00 to 5:00. would that fit within your definition?
the district court put it on there. when you look at the actual entry itself, it's a handwritten entry. there's no way of telling from the handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on the docket on the same date because all you have is the handwritten entry, february 10, file your appeal by february 27, which is unusual in a civil case because normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't get a directive from the court that you have 30 days to file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with this. so i don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a directive from a court.
you're urging on us something like plain error, is about what you're telling us.
i think that's  that's right. now, if it's  if you have a videotape of someone that  that's responding to an interrogation, that's an entirely different thing.
justice ginsburg, i don't think that it's correct to characterize it as more plaintiff-friendly. if you're in minnesota, you can't bring one of these claims, because state law doesn't recognize it.
it does not  it does not relate to the seriousness of the  of the crime at all. the  boyde's dancing 
i, i see where your honor is 
 department of corrections, no.
 there are 200,000 cases a year in chicago, alone. i think that there might be many ambiguous cases. so, you relieve me of my concern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous situations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and she's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to the room  she wants him in  and he, now under your rule, as far as i can see, could not go in. and i'm telling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a lot.
and what does that consist of?
no. but  but that  that's setting the court  the case up. but then what the court says, in terms of how it interprets the statute, we construe the statute to contain an implicit reasonable time limitation, the application of which is subject to federal court review. well, what is a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances.
all right. now, what  what was the page? please. you're going quite  and i want to  because justice ginsburg referred to a statement in the government's brief that you said yes 
yes, they have.
well, your honor, i actually carefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this court discussed the skidmore deference, and, either way, we think that this is  the statute is so clear that, deference or none, there really is no other way to read the language of the statute. as i say, this court, in united states versus o'hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not mean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities. justice o'connor's concurring opinion, joined in by justice stevens, in the holmes case makes that same point. significantly, your honors, the "in connection with" language, as a statutory matter, has consistently been construed by the securities and exchange commission, and by this court, as one of incredible breadth. most recently, in united states versus zandford, this court concluded that the "in connection with the purchase or sale" language means anything that coincides with a securities transaction. and what is significant in this case  it is conceded by the respondent at page 8 of his brief  that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. there really can be no other conclusion. at myriad paragraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at joint appendix 53, paragraph 4; joint appendix 53(a), paragraph 5; joint appendix 59 to 60 
i think it's definitely should be interpreted to include guilty pleas because taking taylor literally, i mean, they only discussed jury trials. but every court with criminal jurisdiction, every court of appeals with criminal jurisdiction, has concluded that it includes guilty pleas. and so i think it  it does make sense. i don't think that the court would have in such a short section of the opinion have exhaustively addressed the entire scope of factual situations, and i don't think it would have addressed the circumstance under which most guilty pleas  or rather, under which most convictions are obtained 
loss of profit 
well, it's not the number of cases either. i mean, you could have  it wouldn't take much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say, that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things of type x or type y, and that would have enormous impact even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.
and i take it 
no, but you  you agree that this is the  the authority here is more than a keep-in-touch group. your problem with it is  is not that you need something more than keep in touch, but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the other state has a veto. and  and that simply gets you to justice scalia's objection. that's the deal you made.
thank you, ms. kirkland.
what did the prosecution use? 9 the fact of early  early conviction and the details of 10 the crime. right?
getting back to the rooker-feldman issue, which is the issue on which the court granted cert, rooker-feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars only appellate review not parallel litigation in federal district courts. rooker-feldman is not a theory of vanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a jurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis mandated by congress in the full faith and credit act. the expansive interpretation asserted by sabic misperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review. it's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28 u.s.c. 1257. it illegitimately displaces the application of section 1738, the full faith and credit act, in most cases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves absolutely no useful purpose.
is that what happened?
justice alito, what the officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of the circumstances and make a decision based upon the totality of what they see. and unfortunately, these situations are always fact-intensive based upon what's seen on the scene. and in the case presented here before the court, none of those facts are presented that  that would actually weigh and that was going to escalate into that type of situation. the officers actually had personal, firsthand knowledge of the events that were happening. they stood outside the home. they watched the event transpire through the window. the exigency was over when the officer entered the home.
no, and i think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. i think this case is unique with the extortion element, but i don't disagree, justice scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. i think people would start defaming with impunity.
well, he didn't cite those cases. i 
you think he could have been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't intend to be part of the school group afterwards? i mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy. and he shows up and he says, oh, you can't  you have to hold me for a whole day's truancy because i didn't intend to be in school. i was in school but i didn't intend to be there.
 that your 
may i ask you to focus on one particular problem that i think is implicated by official justice ginsburg's question. if i understood you correctly a moment ago, and i think this is in your briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if they can, because it involves less risk to the mother from, from acts performed inside. and if that's the case, then it would be, i guess in the real world, very difficult for congress to define a difference between d&e and d&x, because the intention is always, as you understand it, to have an intact result. your brother on the other side, the solicitor general says there certainly is testimony to the effect that that is not so. that doctors who intend to perform a d&e simply intend at the beginning to have a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do the d&e and not have a totally intact procedure. would you comment on what i think is the factual difference between you and the solicitor general there?
are never appropriate unless congress specifically provides for them.
yes.
which is the texas  the texas  you know, the ones 
look, i don't have to cross-reference 
it wasn't extortion because he should have given the easement.
but it's not  if the parents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's not going to be free. i mean, the  the statute gives them 
and all the cases you mentioned were tried before 1991.
 in effect, you're saying there are some in rem exceptions, but not all in rem actions are exceptions. and this would not 
your honor, the  respectfully i disagree. i believe that the california supreme court correctly and  and reasonably determined that boyde's holding encompassed payton's character mitigating  payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding in boyde  or the issue directly presented by boyde was whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.
second habe, he's out cold.
there would be a bar. the bar would apply.
states 
yes, and i agree 
yes, your honor, because, in light of everything that's been said and done in this trial, as the boyde court noted, jurors do not parse instructions for subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions in a commonsense manner, and in 
the difficulty i have with that is that it is  it is impossible  i think you would agree. it is impossible  and may, indeed  let's assume undesirable  to take partisanship out of a political process. and  and if partisanship pure and simple, even though subject to the discipline of districting principles, is  is illegitimate, then i don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of any districting at any time.
you're saying it's permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed. is it not possible that the industry changed at about the time the statute was enacted? that the prevalence of third-party employers is something that really developed later?
no, go ahead.
well, wouldn't the magistrate tell him why he's being held?
but when one judges the adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity, not just one.
and where may that obligation be enforced?
what about  what about a scheme 
i believe the problem is that a plaintiff has  i wish i could say this plaintiff is in  engaged in a trade or business and can deduct it or trade or  as a trade or business expense.
well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it  sorry. were you  is it inconsistent if congress didn't want it? and if that's insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as i look at the statute, to get out my thinking, i think that it sounds like an administrative law statute. if i saw the maintenance and cure words, i'd think it was an admiralty statute.
right, right.
well, wait. it says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) i guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. now, that suggests that if the government intervenes the government is proceeding with the action, right?
i believe it would be raised 
senator 
the amici, amicus 
in this case 
to tip the tipping point, whatever.
 because  what?
your honor, there are cases we've cited and rules where the question comes up, does there have to be a formal order entered. we've cited the sparks case, the alphin case, and the first gibraltar case. and  and there are some cases in which, following the denial of certiorari, courts of appeal continue to engage in reconsideration of the matter. we think that's what happened in the fairchild case cited in the  in the red brief, and to a lesser extent, it's what happened in the muntaqim case coming out of the second circuit. and the reason is 
okay.
that suit was properly brought.
 before.
would it have been permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for 10 years and then change the definition to the other definition for all programs?
well, it  it  i would say that it  it recognized that it was new and that seems to be the way the courts have interpreted 
so one of the guides for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a particular type of case?
those are issues that we believe also are issues that a court would resolve. i think, your honor, that there are very few 
the it being the transcripts of the 16 proceedings that were used in the aggravation phase.
well, justice ginsburg, you're right. certainly the petitioner and his counsel at the time requested this adjournment. they did get the full adjournment they requested, but the judge said that that would be the last adjournment and that the matter would be set for trial then. but whether that time is excludable or not is answered by the statute. the ends of justice provision recognizes that defendants or prosecutors and judges on their own motion would seek or grant continuances, but that's not enough under the statute. the statute is  although it's flexible, is rigorous. the court must make a finding that the ends of justice outweigh the public's and the defendant's interest in a speedy trial.
and your best case on that is munsingwear?
you're saying no reasonable judge could find that that defendant thought he would be hounded.
well, if you had a crime, for example, that said someone who does something while not under  acting under duress, that would be an obvious example. but there are 
 to put it in what i think of as a strong form.
laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?
the same arguments apply in habeas, don't they?
you 
i hope you won't do that.
that may be, but there is also a danger that if he is housed interracially and subjected to gang pressures on the yard, that he will then be in a situation to go back to his cell, when the door is closed and the lights are out, and commit violent acts upon his cellmate at  because of pressures that he's receiving from members of his own race.
the affidavit  wasn't the affidavit available to the executing officer?
 doctrinally, it is government speech. it has the  it has the benefit of enabling the promotion that would have happened in the industry, but for the collective-action problem to occur. but it is government speech under this court's decision. if i may 
but if you  does it make sense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the citizenship of the members of the class for diversity purposes, for diversity of citizenship? only the named representative counts. well, then why shouldn't only the named representative count for amount-in-controversy? that would have been a rational thing for congress if they wanted to fix that.
 where people who are interested in making money are prepared to say, look, we want to make the money. we'd like to get rid all our competitors, and then we start distinguishing between they'd like to get rid of all of them. no, only five. no, one. and does that make a difference in whether you can bring a case or not? i frankly don't see 
he explained because it was the only place where he actually knew the route of the relay.
i assume that's how we got to teague.
it is  your honor, it is the forced hosting of a messenger-based decision 
yes, your honor.
was there any indication that 12 after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing 13 phase began  i take it it was just a matter of hours or 14 almost days till the sentencing  till the sentencing 15 phase began. was there any contact with the psychiatrists 16 or with experts after the sentencing phase and the  17 pardon me  after the guilt phase and before the 18 sentencing phase?
right.
so, what we have is a situation where this is a theoretical possibility under the statute.
intrastate.
as i understand the respondent's position, it's not the component. they're not arguing that. so you're answering a hypothetical case that isn't presented here. and also, respondent says that we are talking only about patents where there is a successful tie. so leave out all those cases where i have a patent and it's never produced a penny, and somehow i can make mileage out of that.
in other words, this wasn't decided  mr. frederick's reply brief talks over and over and over again about how this was decided on the pleadings, and you know, there was no discovery allowed. under rule 56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically said, okay, let's show our hands. we got two jacks. what do you got? and what their expert said and what their response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on it, we wouldn't have been injured. now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the burden is on the adverse  the adverse party must by affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and they didn't do that. now, the classic design defect  let me  let me give you an example.
i'd like to reserve my time.
no, please don't. i start with an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is constitutionally valid. i start with that assumption. i'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably describe. my anxiety is resting only on the fact that this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have to look through 28 pages of fine print. now, you connect that anxiety to something in the law.
no, let me deal 
well, the state doesn't pay the damages.
no, it 
on the facts of this 
you mean he could be held until a charge is filed without being told why he's being held?
i'm afraid that's not my experience with the court of criminal appeals.
that's the normal 
but those conditions, your honor, are similar to the ohio state penitentiary. the difference between  may i finish, justice  mr. chief justice?
it wouldn't be reciprocal. what was the government offering to give him in exchange for his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they had failed to record? what was the government giving him in exchange?
there aren't exigent circumstances. in the case i'm thinking of, i'm thinking of what i call "ambiguity," and there are many such cases, i believe, of spousal abuse, where the wife is intimidated. now, maybe i'm wrong on my facts, but those are the cases i'm worried about.
i have no response to that remark, your honor. [laughter.]
i 
but if you compare it to  this is a court order and it's enforceable. there is no question about that, is there? this is a court order that enforcement officials carry out. how does it differ from, say, a money judgment and executing  levying execution on property? judgment creditor says, here is my judgment, marshal, sheriff, go out and find some of the defendant's property.
we  we couldn't resolve that.
 alleging a constitutional claim. well, which one?
and  and in the record below, plaintiff donald brunelle said that he was prepared to spend considerable sums in support of his state senate election, which  and considerable sums above the expenditure limits that were before  that were adopted by vermont. so the  the question is an independent 
certainly, but where the completed offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. you know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering transaction that there would be overt acts as part of the financial transaction.
why isn't the  the bright line that the government asserts that this is a crime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't  the declarant doesn't think rationally will this be used eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants to stop an imminent threat?
 are not 
then why didn't we have to go the other way in the chinese trade relation example? i mean, everything 
then what is the point of the current summary judgment?
i understood them to be arguing, in essence, that there's some other entity that really is the real party in interest.
well, i hope that's not the case, justice scalia. let me give you two other first amendment examples: the first admittedly involving intermediate scrutiny; the second, a strict scrutiny case. the first thing i have in mind is the contribution limits themselves. this court has fully admitted that it doesn't have a scalpel to probe the difference between $2,000, $1,000, $4,000 as a contribution limit. and it's perfectly willing to admit in its opinions that not every high-value donor is going to be involved in an effort at corruption. yet, this court approved the approach of the contribution limits, which are hard to understand as anything other than prophylactic limits. now, that's an example from intermediate scrutiny. even in the strict scrutiny context, though, a case like burson, i mean, this court understood and said in the opinion, we can't tell whether 75 feet would be precisely okay or whether 90 feet or 100 feet. we don't have a scalpel to probe that either. but we're going to approve 100 feet because it's a basic way of dealing with this problem, identifying the area of potential concern, and people can do their electioneering 101 feet away. they can do it here on the 61st day. they can do it through the segregated fund. i think that is an approach that this court has found acceptable, even in the first amendment area, in dealing with these intractable problems. and i think buckley 
the other three are 
and do you agree that that was violated here, that there wasn't really a knock-and-announce here?
i think i  i think i misspoke. at the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into effect. this challenge was filed in order to prevent the statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately 2,000 michigan indigents a year being denied the right to counsel.
it does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for  for private tuition.
yes. and i, and i  no, it didn't purport to overrule johnson. and the reason why is this: i think the concept that ties this court's cases together on penry is this concept of meaningful consideration. because your honor focused on one bit of language from johnson: the jury has to be able to give some effect. elsewhere in the johnson opinion the court said there has to be a meaningful basis for giving effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the evidence. and i think neither of those two phrases can be read out of the context of the other. in other words, it can't just be some imaginable, conceivable, strained effect. it has to be some effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a juror would  would understand the evidence to relate to future dangerousness. in the johnson case, the defendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and i believe that it was, it is sensible for the court to find that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that its relevance to culpability and its relevance to future dangerousness are essentially coextensive. this case is not like that.
so the reason i can't find it out is none of us know.
it is inherent. it is inherent in that language. it is backed up  clearly it is backed up by the purposes behind the particularity clause. if a warrant  the probable cause  the  the two clauses in the warrant clause, the probable cause, is constitutionally i believe joined at the hip. it is textually joined with the objects of the search, the place to be searched, and the  and the persons to be searched. and as a result 
and that someone is going to be a government official. i have no reason to believe that wardens are  are better at it than judges except with respect to, you know, security and administrative convenience, which we will honor under this statute.
 in connection with this case.
yes, your honor.
what she said was that there were items of drug evidence 
i guess i've been assuming  but the eligibility under chapter 13 even under the present case is a present day question, right? in other words, we don't go back and see if he was eligible for chapter 13 when the conversion was denied? the question would be whether he's eligible now?
okay.
well, the best empirical evidence which exists that we're familiar with was reported in the trulson study, which the dissenters in the ninth circuit petition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the amici have filed with this court. and in that circumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in texas, that only five percent of all of the interracial  of  of all of the incidents of violence in  in the texas prison system were what was described by professor trulson as having racial motivations. and of that five percent, only one-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial circumstances where there had been interracial cellmates involved in the racial violence. and that seems to be, as far as anyone has been able to produce in this case in any part of the record, the best empirical data which might respond to your question, justice scalia.
justice 
some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, your honor.
right.
no. i 
so i'm not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, or they all did it at the same time.
but your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the ten commandments in the display, that would be enough?
just one thing. just when does it become final? let's limit it to one thing.
in the federal court, the district judge said that the tolling provision would not apply here because it was the district court's determination that it was untimely when filed in the state court. that was not, however, the position of the florida courts.
so it is comparable to booker. and then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly describe booker?
what do you do with  following up on justice kennedy's question, the dissent took the position in the ninth circuit that the mitigating value of any proven, quoting a-24, "genetic predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its aggravating tendency to suggest that landrigan was undeterable and even from prison would present a future danger"?
thank you, general. mr. rosenkranz, we'll hear now from you.
your honor, that's to exceed the base range, to go beyond the three terms. if you want to impose an enhancement for gun use, or for an enhancement such as in apprendi, not for selecting a term within the base range.
there's no private right of action conferred by 45-108 itself. now, in the ordinary case, when a federal statute places limits on agency personnel and a particular category of plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was intended to be protected by that provision, then even if the statute that limits agency discretion itself doesn't provide a private right of action, the administrative procedure act would entitle a claimant to get into court and argue that the agency's decision was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. so if there were no question of csra conclusion, we would agree that the claimant could go into court raising a statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action in 45-108 itself. here, we think that the evidence from the comprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to divest the courts of jurisdiction over the statutory claim. we don't think that congress has spoken with the clarity that this court has required to divest the courts of jurisdiction over the constitutional challenge.
no, and i don't think the fcc here is claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its regulations.
it could conceivably be. as long as remedies are, indeed, available to the inmate, there is an obligation under the statute that he exhaust 
was this the same secretary, by the way, as the secretary who issued the new regulation, the same secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?
how could cost justify a dual pay scale?
 you might as well deal with it now 
 there was a purpose for diagnosing the deficiency, i would say no. and while we're on the subject of engaging what our arguments have been all along, we made clear in our brief, and nobody ever responded, at page 38, that claim 13 is only infringed when the assaying and the correlating steps are both performed sequentially for the purpose of diagnosing vitamin b deficiency.
i think as long as it is a blanket sort of statement, that one purpose of the death penalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent with this court's decisions.
that is correct.
i'd  i'll have to look at those decisions. it was my impression that they did, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on the ground that congress had clearly spoken to the point, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.
and  and he has given you all the relief your entitled to. therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.
how about the defense of, i was on the job and everything i did on the job was within the scope of my employment?
if you look ahead, i don't know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what particularized harm does the record show that massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that you want to produce through these regulations?
 but the jury 
i agree, mr. chief justice, but under the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002 was something very, very different. after 1996, when mr. bonilla garnered the high of 30 percent among latino voters, not  not in his district but among that group 
but your  your answer to justice o'connor is there should be no distinction even if there is evidence that there's a long-term relationship, a requirements relationship, and an increase in price.
and your test is that the defendant would have to prove it only by clear and convincing evidence?
why are these absolute? i mean i looked at garner and then i looked at graham and graham which came later said that all claims that officers have used excessive force, deadly or not, should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard. so i guess  isn't that right, isn't that the law?
again, i think if i understand the question, i would say that there's no taxpayer standing there. and i think  but, but and i apologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits. but with all due respect, i don't think you can really meaningfully talk about the flast nexus test without bleeding over a little bit into the merits, because the court did it itself in flast. and what i would say is if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's the very act of money going to the third party conference organizers that's the problem, then it really is a spending case, and i think the taxpayer standing would logically lie. but if it's really, what the concern here is the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences, and not the fact that there's spending on the conferences at all, then i think it's more  it is a case there would not be taxpayer standing.
well, i think  (laughter.)
he's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for mr. cochran  what  what is going to give mr. cochran the remedy he needs? and if we balance that against the  the breadth of this injunction, i think we have to look at  one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.
i know. but it's used on the basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be  they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every 10 years.
that's a very fair point, justice scalia. but even to get at the very  what happened here is very analogous to the legislative evolution this court found unilluminating in martin against haddocks. there, the attorneys fees provision you had before it  before you, used to be in 802 of the statute, which was expressly applicable to pending cases. congress moved it out into its own separate section that didn't expressly apply to pending cases.
 if it 
 with respect to this case? i thought this case was such a good illustration of the problem. if claims came into the federal court neatly labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then i think that you would have a very strong argument. but as this case illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted or not is something on which people can disagree. and i suppose why the district court took well over a year to decide this case is the petitioner says, i've exhausted everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not exhausted 12. and the district court is going by the  going over these one by one and says in the end, you're both wrong. my list is eight. and it's that problem of has this claim been exhausted. now, if it was a case of deliberately withholding a case from state court and bringing it up fresh in  in the federal court, that would be a case where the federal court should say, go away, you didn't even try. but what do you do with these cases where it's really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?
and you get a two month extension.
thank you, counsel.
 which maybe others understand, but i'm confused. imagine that this has nothing to do with indians. it is simply an ordinary contract. now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. so we have to decide was there an appropriation. in our imaginary department of government, the appropriation is $1 billion. nothing is earmarked for anything. they enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. now, they pay out $990 million, and their  what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. so there's no valid contract here. the appropriation wasn't made. now, my understanding of ordinary government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. you look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. so was it during the same time? yes. is it in an appropriate amount? yes. but is it available for this purpose? ah, i'm not sure. all right. now, i want  if i have the  the theory of it right, i want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these  for this indian expenditure. just pretend it's a regular contract. what is the equivalent of that $10 million?
 answered justice breyer by citing the jerome case. after jerome, we decided united states vs. gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or concurrent sentencing terms. and it  are those two cases in some tension? gonzales didn't mention jerome. and i noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either. is there some tension in the cases? and, if so, is this a case where, when we write an opinion, whatever the outcome, we should talk about that? and, if that's so, what should we say?
whatever it takes.
 in connection with 
how do you want us to view his status? do we accept the government's submission that there's probable cause to believe that he was not of  in a formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but that he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al qaeda? can we accept that, that there's probable cause for that?
possibly that evidence would be sufficient to support an indictment, your honor, but i don't believe it would be sufficient to support a conviction. and i also think that it's  it's  we're talking about the outer limits of due process here. if you look at the evidence in chambers, the corroboration evidence there was extensive. there was a witness who said i saw the third party shoot the victim.
your honor, he didn't think it was the wrong person. he was being told it was the right person, and shouldn't be faulted for lack of diligence in accepting the representations that they had the right person.
i agree with you on that, justice scalia.
without being paid if they lose 
well, it's our position that when speech by public employees cannot fairly be said to be speech as a citizen, then the government should have a presumptive right to manage its personnel affairs and internal 
this is a pro se prisoner. he gets his  all the claims are exhausted, it's dismissed. and he seeks a coa on that point.
you know, this is a very interesting case because there are three ways to answer the question of what is a court. you can leave it up to us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to fill in a hole in the statute. you can have the executive do it, decide what case  what cases to prosecute, or if we should knock out this  interpret the statute in the  in a different way than you urge, congress would then do it. now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on deciding which is the  what should the meaning of the word court be? the executive, the legislature, or the judiciary?
right, but this court never suggested that it was  showing that it was impossible for someone to quickly get his claim before the court was 
unless what would happen in these other states as the  is that the court would grant the  the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back to the state court and be told after however long it takes that  that his  his claims are now procedurally barred. do you think the federal court would simply make its own determination that the claims would be rejected by the state court and therefore it would not stay? i don't know.
 by facilitating the importation of drugs from outside the country.
i totally disagree, with great respect. our complaint is that the conspiracy was to require laddering in order to develop pools of orders right after the stock began trading.
correct.
i never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check. i thought the case is over when you have the judgment. (laughter.)
whenever he denies the motion, he must know about it. he must have a reason to deny.
i agree, and  and if  and if the birmingham board, which i trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title ix, but instead that  that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. so to be sure, the birmingham board was on notice that it could not retaliate in  in the business of an official ocr investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was  it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent 
but you  you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the  in the case of a single offering. you could  you could look upon that as, as an attempt to raise the price. that's what it is, isn't it? an attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out there?
no. if excessive force was used against somebody when they're being arrested, that's a claim that everyone agrees accrues at the time of the injury.
and that's ambiguous, i'm saying. that's ambiguous.
but the question is whether when a minor party like the libertarians do it, is  is it going to have that effect.
to confirm precisely that interpretation. that's exactly why ge went to mr. reich and asked for a determination of applicability, and was told categorically psd applicability is determined by evaluating any change in emissions rates caused by the conversion.
thank you, mr. restuccia. mr. schaerr, we'll hear from you.
it would be involuntary 
 -to-sales transactions 
if they've  if they've waived 
when 
that's  that's not what i view of a chosen action as. i view it as a legal right 
oh, okay.
the voting age population for district 23, as created by the balderas court, your honor, was a great deal higher. it was 63 percent, and that was what was able to give the 55 percent voter registration 
and does it normally start the voyage and end it in u.s. ports?
notice that's there's going to be a hearing. what else does he get? does he get a summary of the written report? does he get a  a statement of  of the reasons? what 
 instead of interjecting 
well, your honor, i  i admit that congress 
but it was mentioned  it was mentioned in nelson. but what would be the reason for  for elevating that  that fact in nelson to a requirement? what is the legal principle that would support your argument?
they're instructed in the language of the statute. and in that sentencing factor (a), there is a reference to those special circumstances.
 for all federal causes of action? we've  we've looked to state 
but  but it would  in any case it would pass the threshold inquiry on your test. you would say, boy, it doesn't get any more efficient than this until it gets to zero.
right. and they're saying, "of course there is a discharge. the discharge is a discharge of water." okay? the water runs into it. now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the state standards before the f-  ferc is going to give you a license.
that's 
well, i thought 
i'm  i'm impressed by one of the cases cited in the brief, in which someone causes a person who has a contract with a third party to believe that the third party has repudiated the contract, and thereby gets that person to give the contract to himself. now, in that case, the person defrauded is the other party to the contract, not the  not the third party. and yet, i suspect the third party would  would be direct enough to be  to be within the protected scope, don't you think?
uh, the first amendment rights 
and a reasonable juror could not conclude to the contrary?
well, isn't that exactly what the rule is designed to prevent? in other words, you have no challenge to the dna evidence, and yet you bring up some third party guilt evidence. and your suggestion just now is, well, the jury might think maybe there's not that much to the dna evidence.
well, your 
the district court found that it had blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under the district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were reelected. so the identical outcome was yielded.
your honor, boyde has two specific components to its decision, which is, first, what factor (k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that issue, which california did, in deciding the impact of the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k). so that, first, you start from the premise, as the california supreme court did, in following boyde, that factor (k) facially directed for consideration of payton's mitigating evidence.
and thereafter, all the  all the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it wasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the state to show that it was.
why would it have to be raised in the ninth circuit? i thought this case was controlled by a prior decision of the ninth circuit. therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to take care of this case.
mr. marcus, do you agree with your brother's answer to my last question that there would be an attempt  could be an attempt under florida law simply to take an overt  to commit an overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?
right.
i take it from your answer to justice ginsburg that back in my dr. x, dr. y case, under the new policy if they got to stage 2 and y was identified, that michigan would process the complaint?
i guess i  if i could just go back to the point. you're emphasizing that the treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. but you're not importing plants, you're 
correct. because i think they've waived any  the other side obviously has waived or forfeited any right to object to the  you know, to the 
could you use 
okay.
well, that's 
but would it 
any observation i think 
yes. first of all, congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an ira account is. an ira account is set up just for tax-favored status. congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e)  522(d)(10)(e) requirements that  that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional ira.
 they're saying, but they're doing it all on policy grounds. this definition means this, because that produces a good result. with respect to telephone lines, they say, yes, bundled is, or it isn't, depending upon whether we like the result it produces.
 one of  one of the last interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the one that  the country that's been done out of taxes is canada, not the united states. so, we should help canada, if it's interested in collecting revenue from these people or trying them for a criminal offense, to do that. it  i asked ms. brill, have they been indicted in canada? she said yes, but she said it's  they had not  there has not been a request for extradition. is that  is that 
i didn't have an opportunity to work for a senator who, in fact, to my experience asked me to report on a vote on such a thing. i just wasn't aware of it.
but being the government 
may i ask you the same question i asked your opponent? would you favor or disfavor our certifying the property law issue to the colorado supreme court?
mr. clement.
yes.
why?
he  he says it meant incomplete. and what do you  what did  what did dr. bigbee say it 
right. i think there would be a way  i'm  i'm confident there would be a way to deal with it. and i don't think the way to deal with it is to assume that that's a reason to make harmless error not available to these types of errors across the board.
sorry.
 there? because, correct me if i'm wrong, but it was my impression that the dea was allowing an exemption for peyote use by the native american church before congress passed the law.
 in history or 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
 in light of, in light of the statutory language as it exists now?
well, congress never discussed the change in the hobbs act that you're proposing, in 1948. [laughter.]
 about the practical meaning of "equal access."
but how do you  how do you square that with the  on page 14a  reductions and, as mr. miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing  monitoring or administration by the secretary, shall not be reduced by the secretary to pay for federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what i assume falls under the heading federal functions.
well, you say it provided the basis for the conviction. was it presented to the court in each of these cases?
oh, but if it takes a year a later, then we 
well, he did not  first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not. he was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.
rather, they amended the 1991 act.
 question i had. does the record contain their proposed form of injunction that they requested?
there have been some narrow exceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the frazier and the kuhlmeier cases. but the basic, the heart of it, the requirement that the school demonstrate that substantial disruption before it can engage in suppression of 
i believe in the context of the fourth amendment and the graham factors and the question of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a jury question. but i do concede that if it's not deadly force it's very close to it. but i think the important thing is that, whatever force mister  the petitioner used was limited by mr. harris' driving.
no, but a school 
we don't believe that congress intended to inject itself into the workings of this local territorial tax mechanism. the various policies 
but i hasten to add, i'm not arguing that that is a required element of a compelled-speech claim. i'm simply arguing that when someone has a reason for resisting disseminating a message, that situates it further  closer to the heart of the first amendment. congress came back, after it 
ms. smith, would  could you focusing on this, what's called a finding, although the district judge himself puts it under conclusions of law, just  the court concludes that the spillage occurred after the fbi crime laboratory received and tested the evidence. what is the basis, the specific basis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the fbi tested the evidence?
well, what do you mean by vicious? i mean, that the person is  is nasty, that the person is antisocial or asocial?
 genuine issue ads 
in the real world, do we have such cases?
all right. consider this theory. the congress passes an excise tax. it happens to be a dollar head, on the cattle, just like this so-called "checkoff." and the government uses the excise tax revenue to finance advertising, saying  maybe saying, "eat more beef," maybe advertising, saying, "don't eat quite so much."
yes. the statute does not authorize payment.
does  does it follow from your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale, before they conclude the purchase, should find out what the state has done?
 harrison act.
could they fine him $70,000?
yes, ma'am.
if we had made the totten mistake of suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we have sued as does and we have said we are satisfied with the cia concluding internally whether we are entitled to pl-110 status.
and the court said we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then when it turns out that they got it wrong and there was error they had to apply harmless error review. in texas law, harmless error review turns on the standard whether there was an objection or not, and they went back and said there was no objection. the contrary assertions assumes that when they let the claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance on objection for any purposes, not consideration on the merits, but also for any eventual later consideration on harmless error pursuant to the established state standard.
yes.
right. because there's, again, there's two ways 
no, i don't give them that.
and if not, why not?
and at the time of the framing, counties in england did not enjoy the  the sovereign immunity of the king, did they?
 applying this principle that 
 before the 1980s?
 are possessory  there are "mere possession" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c), but is it not the case that any  if you interpret "trafficking" to mean trafficking in the way the word would be used in ordinary speech  that any state trafficking offense you can think of would have a corresponding felony violation under the controlled substances act, so that if you read the statute that way, the initial phrase is superfluous?
so you have two statutes. one of them seems to be quite ambiguous. the other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases. now, how do i wiggle out of it?
but last time  and you said before the statute was there were only frivolous and malicious. and the court says, we can see from the face of this complaint that it fails to state a claim, too bad it's not a ground for automatic dismissal. so congress said, yes, it should be, and put that one in.
and, can 
well, that 
your honor, i  i think that's a great question.
then you'll be left without  if you've named the wrong defendant, then you have a suit against no defendant. it seems to me you are automatically dismissed. you didn't substitute another defendant.
no, your honor, that is the situation that the court confronts in the three-judge district court cases within in the instances in which there was a mistake made as to where the appeal should be taken. and the court has jurisdiction to decide, the jurisdiction in those instances has vacated and remanded the order. i want to emphasize to this court that in the santos case, petitioner requested that the ninth circuit remand the order to the guam supreme court, and in the language of this court, what that does is it refreshes the judgment of the guam supreme court so that it can timely brought here. if petitioner 
you're saying this all turns on our assessment of the strength of the interest in remaining in federal court? is that what it boils down to?
no, your honor. if the judge had said, i knew this all along back when i heard the evidence that this defendant was incompetent, that would be an even more egregious violation. the court is not supposed to sit and just let the defendant sit out on the streets for month after month after month when  when the defendant is incompetent. the court is supposed to make a  a prompt finding.
just about, justice souter. i  the  the paragraph containing established was in there in the 1863 national banking law, and  and the provision containing located was added to that provision in 1864. so the first time that they both appeared, they did appear together, which is another distinction from the circumstance that the court faces with respect to 1348.
am, am i correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?
 on the difference between  you said "officer in the field." would this be okay if it had been his parole officer?
the relevant analogy in the civil context is not to what a court would do with a statute of limitations defense in the civil context, it is to what would the court do with respect to an affirmative defense that, like the habeas limitations, implicates broader social interests?
okay. because we're talking about aggravating factors.
mr. jones.
well 
oh, no, it's not supported. it's specific. it says go to jeffrey grubbs' residence and then it has an attachment a which describes it with great specificity. and go and search for and seize the records and materials described in attachment b, and then we have 16 different kinds of items with great specificity. that's it. that's the end of this warrant, and that's what it says to do, and that's what he did. and then he has a different affidavit which gives him the probable cause for issuing the warrant i just described.
that's where i'm having trouble on your side. i can't get very far with a history of other places. apparently i can't get there. tax doesn't seem to help me very much. so i thought, well, one thing is clear. what they're trying to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at it, take all of the list of property that they don't tax. i guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business or something.
if he had written here, instead of "2-10," he had written down "2-12," then the prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?
in the midst of the enforcement action that's being brought against them by epa? what's supposed to happen in the enforcement action, if that's the vehicle through which epa is implementing its new interpretation 
yes. i  i stand corrected here. i'm sorry.
is that because you concede, in effect, that they would not be part of the estate if we adopted an in rem theory that included the preferential transfers?
the other side says that guilt is not as  not as clear as you  as you make it out. is  is that  is that issue even before us here?
i'm sorry?
and 
what this  what the seventh circuit did was look at this court's opinion and see that the statement of the issues, on page 397 
and he's saying it violates the constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.
thank you. very helpful. the other thing which i brought up, so i might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago i read a decision by judge leventhal that made a big impression on me. and he was a very good judge. it's in a different context, it's the same problem. he said, i originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where i could conscientiously say, although i consider the findings clearly erroneous, so i'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. and therefore, i affirm it, because it comes from an agency. but when i think about it, i don't think there's substantial evidence either. okay. in other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, i think that this is harmless, so i'll affirm. but i don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so i'll reverse. i mean, i find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where i think such a thing is possible.
well, i'm  i'm focusing on the tort of malicious prosecution which is 
well 
that is certainly not what 
also 
it's in their brief. they repeatedly quote the portion of morgan which described pay claims as discrete acts subject to the discrete trigger rule in the morgan opinion. and that, of course, is an obvious concession that they had to make in this case, because mr. russell would not concede when justice scalia asked that that first pay rate decision was not an identifiable act, that it wasn't an actionable  immediately actionable claim.
yes. i may be wrong about having 
correct, your honor. they would actually have to go out and get a warrant to enter the home. there's not an exigent circumstance under the facts that you presented which would require them to enter the home and bypass the warrant requirement. it's not severe enough under those facts.
 and it was regarded as fairly subsumed just as 
i take it the texas probate court determined the validity of a will here.
well 
yes.
that would seem to me to be a very express legislative repudiation of the jerome 
so it just can't be that  so the fact that you don't have a privacy interest in contraband, it doesn't seem to me  i  i don't think you need that argument.
all right. that  that  what you've quoted many  much of this i wouldn't repeat in polite company. you've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. one, this is not just defamation. it was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. and there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. it is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for  for desisting from that type of activity. all right. now, those are the findings against you. so suppose i agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the first amendment. all right? now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. now, i want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what i was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in  with methods similar to this one. see, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. and i want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. and what i'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. are there limits? if so, what?
if the boss makes a determination that, "this is not brady materials. i don't want that disclosed," and the employee goes ahead and discloses it, our position is, that would not be protected first amendment speech.
so if a doctor is being honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor could escape the language of the statute on the government's interpretation?
i'm not so sure. you think that we could just say we're going to exercise our best judgment, not necessarily amend the constitution, just because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby banned forever? do we have the authority to just say that?
sorry. i don't understand that.
that's not true. there are cases where the violation of the knock and announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you can show that the seizure is related to the violation. the problem here is that the evidence that is being suppressed, as  as you've suggested, that there's no question that it would have been available if the officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.
well, it has to be  i think it has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be 100 percent of the fair market value.
is there going to be a different standard 
where 
dr. cooke's and  drs. cooke and 20 sadoff testified that they were given an open-ended charge 21 to look at mitigation 
 you with a  with a question?
no, we didn't reach that, last time.
i think 
do you  when  when you make that point, that on this record the  the claimed interests are not compelling or not proven, would you have us leave the door open for a greater degree of proof? for example, take the  the problem of candidate time. the lower the donation limits are, the  the more donations there have got to be, and  and there's  there's plenty of comment, particularly in some of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that political candidates generally spend scrounging around for money. if we decided the case your way, would the door be left open for a more impressive and compelling record on this issue?
now, you see, you're talking about the wide  you  you say there are a lot of failed patents. the person got it because he thought it would, but he shouldn't have because it actually made no difference.
the advice concerning right to appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was a form from 2000. the  the 2004 form is available from the michigan supreme court web site, and it has been modified now that  because the trial court  it seems apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning right of  to appeal. the way it reads now is it will say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal. so this  this  the colloquy now would happen differently, but i think that 
yes, your honor.
you can say that, but what  when someone's  you know, sues, what they're upset about is how you handled the vehicle, not how you handled the mail. yes, at 30,000 feet, you can look at this and say it's all transmission. but congress was looking at this as, sort of, on-the-ground level. and, in practical experience, the  the person who was hit by the mail truck doesn't care if there's mail in there or not. their injury is completely unaffected  the presence of mail is incidental, irrelevant 
 in the sense that 
and it's the definition of employer that says he has to have more than  more than 15 employees. so, in effect, you  in making your complaint, you  you at least implied and maybe said that this person is an employer under the act. so it seems to me at that point the  the burden shifts to the other side to say  the burden of going forward of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted what  what your complaint on its face says.
right. and 
ten to 20 years.
i mean, that  that's what you're suggesting, isn't it?
can you tell me, if you know, how many cases in the texas system, capital cases, are pending that were decided before the legislature amended the instruction?
no, your honor 
no, that's correct, your honor. that would solve the constitutional problem here, but your honor is right, i think there is a significant concern about whether that's what new hampshire would have done 
yes, and i think 
so why is that not enough to satisfy the standard to require the prosecutor to give an answer?
mr. starr, you  you responded to justice breyer that you think the school could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on a trip. could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands on a trip?
well, they're  they're  i thought your position was newly recognized means that it  it has to be the kind of a right that would  would overcome our usual bar to  to, you know, rights that existed before.
but the congress in 1972 also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement of policy to reserve to the states the power and the responsibility to plan land use and water resources. and under your definition, i  i just see that we're giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a congressional policy.
justice o'connor, the  the panel did get the decision right in the second case, and it did so in response to a thorough review of the entire record. courts of appeal frequently engage in reconsideration without requiring additional briefing and 
she called 
we would not, but we also think  and if the court made that clear in this case, it wouldn't be a basis for invalidating the statute; it might be a basis for sending it back or an as-applied challenge. importantly, we 
well, justice souter, the thing that i think is very troubling in this case is that there's a very basic bankruptcy policy, and that basic bankruptcy policy on preferences is equality of distribution and to prevent abusive debt-collection practices on the eve of bankruptcy.
i would respectfully disagree. i  i think there's a  there's a fundamental difference. presumably a  a actor or an entertainer  their  their market value is  already has some type of tangible value. the  the agent might 
so where does it say that? where does it say that?
but you might win that litigation. it's not impossible, is it?
 ginsburg, i misspoke. i meant to say rule 15. but if  to encourage parties to do this under rule 15, the court should adopt a presumption against sua sponte consideration. and this  in arizona versus california, which they rely on heavily, they say that this type of consideration should be reserved for rare circumstances. and we cite several cases in our brief where that  that also support that proposition. so, we would submit, if you do get to this analysis, justice alito, that there should also be a presumption involved.
so that would  that would certainly be probable cause to arrest just based on the wig-wag, plus the fact he lied to the police in  in instructing them the button to push or didn't tell them what button to push to make them go.
thank you, counsel.
is the answer.
may i ask you 
 continuum there.
well, i think the  it's not  the system is not limited to music.
 to the child 
in practice, the  a search  a parole search may not be arbitrary, capricious, or conducted solely for the purpose of harassing 
yes. that's perfectly legitimate. that  as i understand the hypothetical 
don't mainstream religion adherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in their cell?
well, your honor, i guess my response to that is that, first 
 peyote outside of prison would be justified even under that standard. i would think, a fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls. i want to make another point about the incentives, though, which i think is important. every state in the union provides some degree of accommodation for religion, and in many states it's majoritarian religions that are accommodated. now, if there's going to be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in order to take advantage of things offered for religion that aren't available for something else, at least rluipa has the virtue of making sure that all religions are accommodated neutrally. so if there's any incentive, it's an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to between sects  sects of religions, and i think that's the way you would have without rluipa involved. the other point i want to make is although there may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many of the reported cases involve things that i don't think people are necessarily lining up to do. i mean, there are a number of lower court cases dealing with the availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get cold food rather than hot food. and i don't think 
yes. how  how can it be fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?
can't i just sell it for those people who don't need it for  for high ph soil at a third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way, don't use this in high ph soil? it's crazy to say you can't do that.
mr. mccartan.
well, but 
yes.
all right, if that's 
all i'm suggesting is that if the court were concerned that somehow there is a disconnect between the pleading standard and the ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that incongruity  if it is one  would to be reconsider the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that bath water.
i believe that actually would not be the practice in civil law countries, for example, where a judge as the inquisitor has much more flexibility than he does in an adversarial system when and whether to consider evidence that may or may not have come in at the certain time. but i'd like to get back to, justice souter, your question, with respect to two additional points why the treaty  and i'm not saying this is our rule  the treaty says the state has to notify and  and it doesn't say the lawyer has to notify.
how would you know whether the  the dog  i don't think the dog alerts, as i'm alerting, for one reason or another. he just alerts.
it's a loss. $250 versus $200.
i assume that's what they're going to tell us.
but your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning. that's not the same as saying every regulation that is a modification must be the same no matter what the program.
that was before the new policy.
thank you, mr. frederick. mr. joseph.
that is  that is definitely 7 contested with respect to drs. cooke and sadoff. with 8 respect to dr. gross, who was the first expert that was 9 hired, he testified that his marching orders were fairly 10 limited, and i think that's where this idea is coming 11 across that all the experts were only charged to look for 12 competency to stand trial.
that's correct.
 approximately the same procedures, what's the point of having a military commission? i think that was implicit in justice scalia's question. so, if you go back  revolution, seminoles, modoc, mexican war, world war ii  why have them?
 would it  would your position be different if the contract contained a specific  the license  a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue?
yes.
the initial wait.
they don't 
no, typically you don't. but it is certainly permissible and possible for this court to do so.
counsel, if i could interrupt you. as i understood it, this gets back to where you started. your position is that if this same scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986, that your position would not be the same. in other words, you said  your suggestion was that it was the legal context at the time in '86 that governed what congress thought the effectiveness of its statements in committee reports would be. maybe i'm ascribing one of the justice's views to you.
 in the house. and if you look at the warrant that the officers obtained, it more clearly elaborates that she said there were drugs and paraphernalia. but, for the court's purposes, this case is virtually identical to illinois versus mcarthur with respect to the probable cause. you have a wife and a husband who are in a domestic dispute, and the wife comes out, in illinois versus mcarthur, and tells the officers, you know, "he's got drugs inside there." and the court was unanimous, i believe, on the point that that furnished probable cause. but what is different from illinois versus mcarthur, and this case, is that the police officers have the consent of someone who reasonably appears to them to have common authority, someone who's living in the marital home, someone who is in a position to know what's going on and exercise her own independent authority. and for this court to say, "well, there are alternatives"  you know, the police could pull respondent out of the house and quarantine it while they go get a warrant, or the police could do other investigation, or they could rely on exigent circumstances  what that does is treats her consent as worth nothing. it reduces her 
 it, if it isn't that?
well, i think that's right, but that's also why i guess i don't regard it as particularly helpful that the fcc opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is official unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.
well, maybe, maybe not. i mean, they convert. he comes up with a plan under 13 that looks better to creditors. i mean, just because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that official that's going to be the same situation after conversion.
well, your honor, that's not the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case. in both of these cases defense counsel presented his case to the jury during  through his evidence and his argument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was an aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is exactly what graham 
in the hypothetical that your honor gave of a factual determination that the clerk spoke english well, that fact under the england case and under england's rationale would be subject to relitigation in federal court in the pullman context. and we believe that there's no significant difference between our context and the pullman context. i do recognize that that is contrary to the normal rules of res judicata. the normal rules of res judicata are designed to prevent exactly what this court decided should be  should happen 
you're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?
had you taken out advertisements prior to that time frame?
may i just stop you with that point? because one of the things that unitherm said about that argument  which, as you prefaced, is not before us  is, the court of appeals was looking to a truncated record to see whether there was sufficient evidence that, in fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it that the federal circuit examined, so that the federal circuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking to the appendix that was before us, but that was not the whole picture.
the defendant might be able to do that. but, of course, that would  treating the case this way would collapse the confrontation right into the compulsory process clause. the confrontation right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into court. it's to be confronted with the witnesses against 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i'm sorry. i keep interrupting you.
mr. phillips, can i call your attention to the text of section 254(a)? it's in the red brief in the alvarez case, at app. 1. what it  what it says is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation or minimum wages for and on account of any of the following activities: (1) "walking, riding," blah, blah, blah. this is (1).
how do those documents shed any light on recklessness? i didn't see that.
well, that's why this is problematic.
yes.
yes. yes. the court is not absolutely limited by the affirmative defenses asserted by the state. for  and that is perhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative defenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity. if the court was going to have to assess a brand-new constitutional claim that the habeas petitioner 
he can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as i pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's  california doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. and therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. under people v. gonzales, 12 cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the state of california. so in the unlikely event that mr. tory was engaged in speech praising mr. cochran, one, and two, in the  in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under first amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the state of california because the collateral bar rule has no impact.
thank you, mr. eisenberg.
i want to know  you said that there are alternate, alternative means, so i'm asking what they are.
i believe that the rule for the fifth amendment claim, i believe the court's view in chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial. so it would be our view if that is an element of the claim, that that claim would not accrue until trial. a claim 
does it make sense to say that any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally navigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads right into a traditionally navigable water is not necessarily covered?
justice ginsburg, to  to  first of all, we wouldn't have indicted for capital murder if we didn't have that evidence. we wouldn't be discussing the beck issue. it wouldn't be a lesser-included offense question. we'd strictly be focusing on those facts, number one, that particular witness rice was on the other side of the vehicle. you had separate testimony from lipsey, the co-defendant who was in the vehicle and could  behind where  where 
well, presumably it would be a waste of everyone's time unless he  i don't know that he would have to disclose the report, but he would need to direct their attention to the issue he would like them to brief.
well, perhaps, but it is the system that congress has given us. congress has said the debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not been converted previously.
the  well, the  the official bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case, the new case, but they haven't dismissed it. dismissal is in fact on appeal to the district court for the district of massachusetts. the reason is, in our view is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior case. now, it is a difficult issue in some respects because there is case law at least in massachusetts or the first circuit that says a debtor does not have standing to object to claims in a chapter 7 case. so the fact that a number of claims were filed and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case, does not have a preclusive effect in the new case. now we did, in fact, object to quite a number of claims and the eligibility, and i think that ultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we will be within the statutory limits.
are you referring to runyon, for instance? the parents always had a special relation to the child. it's something of a stretch to say that the corporation has that same relation with its own shareholder.
well  oh, not  we do not think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive. and i  i can  can address that, but 
well, no, i think it's not, and i think it's very consistent with what we see in mississippi. in california, factor (a) contains two independent components. one is the "circumstances of the crime," and one is the "special circumstances." the california supreme court, both before it affirmed mr. sanders' death sentence and after  before, in a case, people versus hamilton, and after, in people versus benson  in the context of assessing invalid special circumstances, said that it presumes the jury follows its instructions, and considers the special circumstances independently of their underlying facts.
yes, they would, they would. and again, there would certainly be constraints to too rigid enforcement of that particular provision.
i wonder if you have a claim for incompetent counsel representing you.
the government has no position on the matter.
well, i  i would think ordinarily yes, but with this caveat. unlike race which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-making process, there can often be a prosecution  and this case is one of them  in which you might have claims of public corruption. and  and in fact, there was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the postal service board of directors for receiving payments to  for his activity on behalf of respondent's corporation and others. this  this  involving contracts for $250 million. this was a very, very important procurement by the post office department and it is understandable that in connection with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the postal service investigators would look into issues of respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the government.
what that tells him is nothing about the facts. that tells him he's been charged. period.
directly.
how about for first grade? did she make an application for first grade?
has it worked anyplace? take mexico, turkey, any country you'd like.
thank you, mr. somach. mr. smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but you do not have to use it all.
is it  it's  no, the patent  the licensee is coming into court and wants a declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without the fear of an infringement suit.
can i ask you about an argument i think they did make? i think they made this official argument. on page 26 of your brief, i think it's explained well. you set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is "any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase." then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to  is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate. so that's out of it. now, the question is what's in it? if that's out of it, what's in it? i think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours. and they say their proof of that is that that was the epa's interpretation for years and years and years. indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it. and then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more. it's just you run it more hours. now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about. and they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the official fourth circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend. all right. now, that's what i think, that's what i think is lying  maybe that's lying at the heart of it. and if it is, what do you say?
well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price. the minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.
you certainly  wouldn't you 5 be making the opposite argument if it were a dna test? if 6 it were a dna test, you would certainly be arguing that 7 even though the results didn't come into existence until 8 32 years after his federal conviction, that he could have 9 discovered it 38 years before because he could have asked 10 that the test then be performed.
no, i'm not 
they take the authority  the position that michigan has no authority to impose on the state-chartered operating sub the two michigan laws 
yes, that's true. i was referring to justice ginsburg's question about the  the practice, whether it continues. but again, regarding its use in this case, i would  i would say that it  it's not  does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it was noted basically to treat african american venire members differently because the record actually 
why  why does that affect the turner analysis? i'm sorry. i don't understand.
i find it hard to believe that. (laughter.)
that's correct, justice o'connor.
but why?
i'm not posing what the rules say. does the record tell us whether  you know, whether this system is just something we're talking about or whether it really has an effect on people moving from this classification to another classification.
and if the question is whether there is a problem out there in the real world on  for people whose interest is certainly not identical to yours.
justice breyer, it's a definition of "corruptly" that 
justice stevens, the 
the express terms of the twenty first amendment would allow that if  particularly if it were necessary to advance the concerns of the twenty-first amendment. for example 
well, your honor, first, i  i don't think they're  he was without process. mr. stumpf had abundant process within the state system. he got all the evidence 
no. that's correct, your honor.
it did not. none of this court's cases in the douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.
 with, as you suggest, an alternative that would be acceptable? suppose there had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than not that in some cases  not in all, but in some cases  use of this injection would cause excruciating pain. would the petitioner who is objecting being exposed to that have to come up with an alternative in order to avoid the risk of excruciating pain?
how could that be helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother to testify about drug and alcohol abuse? what use would the expert be if the potential predicate 
but was it in fact?
well, justice souter, we know from mesa that if congress had just made all covered class actions removable, we would have to find some federal defense to support article iii jurisdiction. congress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just pointed the federal courts to the particular federal defense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make article iii satisfied under the mesa case. that's all that that cross reference is doing. it's not, however, picking up every element. if congress wanted to include every element of title vii, that environmental statute of slusa, it would have put them in the jurisdictional provision. arbaugh says 
they should reask the certified question?
yes.
okay. can i finish the description of what actually happened? according to the students, for those who were released from class, there was no requirement for staying on campus, and many of them did not stay on campus. no requirement for 
the specific reason i think, your honor, is so that the sentencing commission can take that information into account in later revisions of the guidelines. that was the purpose at the point that statute was passed.
exactly, your honor. so he has an amended judgment filed in march of 1998. he files his first petition challenging his conviction under that petition. later, in 2002, he files a second petition challenging his sentence.
was there an objection to the testimony that established this?
well, regardless if it  whether it comports with the common law, i don't see why the rule that you are urging, closely related, is going to make a dime's worth of difference unless ultimately we hold that there is an obligation to state the cause at the time of the arrest.
couldn't have a messenger? he just delivered some mail. the post office was slow.
mr. dreeben, could this question of the effect of the avena treaty be brought before the court? mr. donovan raised, i think, the all writs act, and he also raised original writs in this court. if the coa doesn't work, then treat this  i think that's what he's saying  treat it as though it were an application under the all writs act or an original writ.
yeah, and therefore they are immune unless  unless they fall within an exception. and it may be they do. is that not right?
i am saying a lot more than that, and that is, first of all, because the vast majority of things that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as tantamount to fraud or a biased judge. and  and the second incredibly important thing is that congress changed the decision-maker. under 60(b), you have 645 individual district court judges applying the historic equity power to  to overturn final judgments.
it was out of his hands, which means that, you know, you're  you're sort of pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which was that you left it to the corporation to settle this claim. and now you want to disclaim the advantage of a corporation and say, oh, although the  you know, the corporation settled it out  you know, i was no longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy  i want to bring the claim on my own. i mean, i can understand why it would be nice for you to get that, but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to play dog in the manger that way. you either  you either accept the corporate form or you don't.
this is a case where the parents unilaterally decided to move the child to a private school, and then they sought tuition reimbursement?
you  you would agree to that?
well, the holding of the adams versus st. lucie county case was that in 1985, an incident which occurred six weeks after the garner decision and four years before the brower decision, there is no way the officers could have known at that time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been considered deadly force in violation of the fourth amendment. as the dissent pointed out in the, in the adams case, though, certainly as of the court's decision in 1993, this was now clearly established. you had brower saying that it's a seizure, and then you had this court saying that now the law was clearly established where it wasn't before 
did you say there is or 
if this were a house in the situation, it would certainly bring out the tension between kyllo and place 
the timely petition to the ninth circuit and the grant of certiorari would have suspended the finality of the guam supreme court judgment. once congress in its authority to demarcate the jurisdictions of the lower federal courts had passed that the statute, it was no  for no court to question that, was divested jurisdiction at that time. the guam supreme court judgment was again final and it had 90 days to petition. i should say there are other cases. eisenberg makes clear that time was not suspended when the court below does not have jurisdiction. the market street railways case makes clear when as a matter of law the lower court no longer can act on the case, the time is no longer suspended. and the jesse oil case makes clear that the party can not rely on a false exercise of jurisdiction by the lower court.
thank you, mr. meade. mr. himelfarb, you have four minutes remaining.
well, do you  do you take the 22 position that the  that the argument that the prosecutor 23 makes has got to refer explicitly to future dangerousness, 24 a kind of talismanic words criterion so that we'll have a 25 bright line rule and everyone will know where  where he 1 stands?
the controversy could arise in any number of ways.
are you entitled to represent yourself on appeal?
the petitioner said he agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.
so it's just a metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an indictment? it's not some other standard of what's fundamentally unfair or, from the sixth amendment, whether or not there's notice? official
yes, your honor. and we do not dispute that standard, because there were out-of-circuit cases, though later overruled by those own circuits. we've suggested that punitive damages could be aggregated. and that was the  that was one of the bases for removal, but not the only one. so, when plaintiffs removed the case, plaintiffs had no incentive, by virtue of 1447(c), in the way it had been interpreted in the tenth circuit, to make remand their first order of business, given plaintiffs' experience that these battles can be long and hard and unrewarding. and the removal was arguably correct. now, by a year later, that had changed. that calculus of the plaintiffs' counsel had changed when defendant  one of the defendants  put in an affidavit suggesting that the named plaintiffs had no damages. at this point, the plaintiffs' calculus changed, because there was, at this point, a very real risk that if plaintiffs ignored the problem now and proceeded to a victory in the district court, then that victory could be vacated at the defendant's interest  instance, by claiming a lack of jurisdiction. and this, then, was a risk that the plaintiffs could not take at that point.
yes, your honor. i've proposed what i suggest would be the standard, which is, going back to the text, "what expenses were incurred as a result of," and i think that naturally means "what were in  what costs and fees were incurred that would not have been recur  incurred, or would not have been incurred again, had the case been left in state court." now i 
yes. yes.
i think i got your point.
 brief question? would that be true if the university didn't allow any access whatsoever to any employer?
 as defined by 924(c)?
he can do it, though.
but isn't that also true even if there's monopoly power? that's what  i really think it's a very interesting question as to whether it makes any difference whether the monopolist who happened to have a patent just charges high prices for product a or decides to charge a little less for product a and make hay out of product b.
there's no question that  we are not questioning that rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas corpus, but section 2242 does not give any guidance as to how 15(c)(2) should be interpreted. and i believe that guidance comes from rule 11.
well, it's  our obligations are through the contract, and our only obligations here are the ones in the contract. and that contract  that provision is in the contract. and as a result of that, we were  we were mandated to enforce that provision. if the government wanted that provision out, it had the final authority to take it out, and it would only have been included if, as a matter of authorization, opm wanted it in there.
in retrospect, your honor, they would have been plastered with notices.
your honor, the  the court  that's  that's correct, yes. and i guess what i'd  i'd say is that what seemed to be driving the court, though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; that is, as the court said in muhammad, if a claim threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, then that isn't a  or that isn't a claim that should be brought in 1983.
but i think  i think that's why i said earlier that there was some element of untidiness to our position. that is, we're not contending that this was precisely the scheme that congress envisioned. but our  our  the court's task, i believe, is to reconcile congress' apparent intent  attempt to construct a comprehensive scheme that 
well, i mean, this  this 
i'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock. i thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.
is the second circuit wrong in u.s. v. hamdi? because it seems to me that u.s. v. hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness.
because there the officer is unaware of the fact based upon the  as i understood the facts presented, unaware of the fact that that is not 
and you have to look at 
well, with all due respect, your honor, we would disagree as to whether  as to the extent of the prejudice. i believe that his affidavit in  both with respect to the vienna convention claim and his previous affidavit with respect to just other varieties of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, indicates that he had some concern about the credibility of some these witnesses who were identifying mr. sirena. but in any event, he made that strategic judgment. the trial court said that it was not ineffective assistance of counsel, and for whatever reason, that judgment was not appealed to the virginia supreme court.
because i don't read the opinion that way. i don't think that opinion has to be read to say that they're not going to allow in anything that goes to the ind.
we're not reviewing the district court's opinion. we granted certiorari as to the particular question which will deal with what was the court of appeals opinion. we don't ordinarily simply compare the court of appeals' opinion with the district court's opinion to see if they parse.
i  i think that is a sensible rule. i mean, basically our rule 
 offset could be 
how  can we decide? but i'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but i mean, if we were to say fobian is wrong, everybody will agree with us. but we should have to say why it's wrong. and if we say the reason that it's wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at all, you'll be delighted. and if we say the reason it's wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees regardless, they'll be delighted. and our only other alternative is to not say why it's wrong or  i mean, that's the problem.
of course 
so in other words, the criterion was the kind of rank they had before.
it's 
but what the court said, i take it  and i have quoted a lot of the language there  it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in  quote, "though it may not be regarded as commerce" 
mr. phillips, may i just ask you a preliminary question about the ibm case  ip  ibp 
well, when you state justice scalia is right, you are assuming, i think as your brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice, not the provision of an education. now the active choice may be of value. i do not suggest that it is not. clearly the school district thinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice. but it is not the entire benefit that is being provided, and the principal benefit is the education, not the choice of schools. isn't that correct?
well, take a recent case in which a defendant transported drugs from mexico into the united states, and he claimed that he did that because someone threatened his family members in mexico. now, that's a case that somebody who has deliberately violated the law would find relatively easy to manufacture that defense. yet, it would be very difficult for the government to disprove that beyond a reasonable doubt. yes, but if the burden of proof is on the defendant, then the government can do what you were talking about. it can cross-examine that person and it can persuade the jury 
is the following sort of summary fair: because florida is not a generic burglary state, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy the burglary prong in subsection 2? but on your argument, even though florida is not a generic burglary state, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the "otherwise" prong; is that correct?
certainly. well, the answer is yes and no. the answer is, if you're talking about  (laughter.)
but  but why can't you go one step further and refer to the document that was not in the record but that the judge mentioned in his  in his findings at the first sentencing? why? i still haven't had a reason why.
suppose i sell you a house and i make a promise that i'll fix any leaks in the bathroom. and lo and behold, before there's a leak the  i'm bankrupt. and while i'm bankrupt it floods, the bathroom. no claim?
thank you, mr. carty.
you could probably say that in every  in  in every antitrust case where  where the defendant is  is alleging a  a monopoly on the part of the plaintiff. it's almost always the case that the plaintiff knows  knows more about his business than the defendant does. it's not distinctive here, it seems to me.
by having him take more tests than would be produced by a purely random selection.
all right. i could see how that could be a violation because it's possible that equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential. but now they can't do that because the two parents have agreed that they can't.
i think he said he was unaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and screaming.
so your arguments do not depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation?
the government has said that  that you have essentially waived their sentencing guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your brief to consider.
my complaint is that two gasoline companies controlled the price that they were never able to fix before.
i'm not talking about here. i'm saying that in your  if i adopt your position in this case, i would have to have the same position, i would think, in the most egregious cases. wouldn't i? because the only reason i'd adopt it here is because congress wanted it no matter what.
thank you. attorney general bennett, you have 7 minutes remaining.
your time is  why isn't hamdam a uniquely vulnerable individual that  you used the phrase "uniquely vulnerable individuals" were involved in another case, but not here. why not here?
what is  what is unemployment compensation? those two i think of as those are law-mandated coverage that every employer must have: workers' comp and unemployment. so what's unemployment, is that a plan too?
no. i think the case would be proper if johns did certain things. one is, give him counsel. now, i understand the court says, "maybe we won't go that far." but, if you're not going to give him counsel, what else can you do? you can certainly tell him that the comment by officer reese was improper, "we will honor your right to an attorney. what officer reese said was wrong." as we point out in our brief, there was never a time when detective johns spoke to blake directly and made any efforts to clarify, or even resolve, the alleged  the violation. in fact, detective 
well, it may be a semantic question. that's 
i'm sorry?
your honors, if 
okay, then 
justice kennedy, it did set an execution date but it was not informed either that the mandate hadn't issued or that there was a federal court stay in place. in a decision in which both of those two facts were brought to its attention, the alley case, which we cite in the red brief, the tennessee supreme court refused to set an execution date, ruling that it was premature. and that's consistent with 28 u.s.c., section 2251, which says that if there's a federal court stay of execution in place, any execution date set by the state court is null and void.
yes, but the  the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?
 i thought it was not clear. and, therefore, what i'm asking you for is  if your rule 
well, in  in hindsight, you've always made a mistake if your client is found guilty. i  i'm just not sure how this inquiry would proceed. it seems to me that there ought to be either automatic reversal on one  on one hand, or the other rule ought to be incompetency of counsel. but you're  you're going to have satellite litigation with speculation, and it seems  it seems to me not a good remedy.
i 
i think it's probably a bit much to say that the core of the first amendment is internal employee grievances or speech. and i think the concern on the other side is that you may  as a lawyer, you may have a view of what the  what brady requires. your superior may have a different view. and just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean that you have a constitutional right to continue to voice your view when your superior has reached a different decision.
i think it is changing its position. when four judges signal that this may be a procedural impediment in the case and the court declines to embrace it, i think that is a signal to this court that 
well, here, they say  look, i take it you're using this because i was going to ask you. you know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect boston. you know, we can  oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. you know, i can multiply the examples 
oh, i think if they were engaging in an act of hooliganism 
did they have reading materials? i 
well 
well, i think that's  i mean, i think that's because they exclude 
 to the contrary. now, that's different from your proposition of probable cause.
 just as they lied about a lot of other stuff, according to 
the  i think it is important here to look at the fact that no party in this case  that the state has not advanced that this is a practice that should be endorsed or adopted. it is clear that everyone involved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that would otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial testing, and i think that's the problem in this case. and i do believe if you look closely at the state court opinion in this case, you will see that the court below's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious reading, when you look at exactly what the state court decided.
so you're  you're going to  you  you then want to draw a distinction between the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a  a conventional synthetic poison.
that reports of the tax court that have to be disclosed.
they may be amended, yes.
which opinion was that? i missed that.
fine. now, all right 
the problem is is that the way the michigan system works, it works on a strict rotation system, and so there's no  there's no line-jumping here. there's no right for a  a client to  to request a certain attorney, for a certain attorney to go the head of the queue and say i would like to represent that fellow and be 
may i ask this? i assume you would agree that if the defendant had  had hired a thug to go out and beat up his competitor, the competitor would have a cause of action.
it would also keep the professors from other mischief. (laughter.)
not taxpayer standing. anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church probably has standing as a matter of direct 
the existence of that statute would seem to suggest  and a statute which is limited to countries that will do the same for us  would seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for canada.
yes, your honor, i would agree with that.
and could that present enough evidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the fact finder, could find a batson violation?
because the bankruptcy court rendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new case. we are objecting to the chapter 7 claims in the old case. i apologize if this is confusing.
right. that's 
all right. so we have a degree of freedom on this. but  but the  the question then is, is it  how  i'm getting the impression from you and  and from the sg that it's rather deeply embedded in the law, if we start reading the fifth circuit cases, that if we define x as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel in navigation, that the cases have said the word in navigation mean nothing, with one exception. the exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented connection to the land so they can't escape. otherwise, if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. if it's a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. if it's my garage door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in navigation. now, how accurate is that assumption i'm now making? what would i read in the law? is that definition of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really embedded in the law?
and it's nicely embodied in microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word "antecedent." a blueprint or a design is a precursor to the actual device. it is the instructions about how to make something. it's not the thing itself. and here what we have is the object code that is the precise commands that, unlike design information, interact continuously with the hard drive and with the processor in order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.
well, why did  the court on page a-17 ruled that there was no waiver. so why would they then send it back for an evidentiary hearing on waiver?
but under this federal circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not been the post-verdict motion.
and  and i would point out, your honor  and this has to do, i think, with the impact of the new legislation that's been pointed to in the supplemental briefs  that at least six of the court of appeals cases addressing the issue presented in these cases involved claims that would not be covered under the new section 703 because they  they don't involve claims for unlawful discrimination or  or fca claims or certain medicare claims 
i think it's the alano standard, at least in the federal 
and he's not getting the benefit of this, because his homestead  he lives somewhere else.
and do you think that it should cross the constitutional line under the interpretational theory of the first amendment you wish us to adopt?
i always used to laugh at wickard, but that's  that's what wickard said.
you do, mr. chief justice. and the court in merrell dow drew a distinction between what is substantial enough of a federal question to trigger arising-under jurisdiction as an original matter and what is substantial enough of a federal question to obtain this court's review. and we're dealing here just with the kind of substantiality that's necessary for original jurisdiction under 1331.
mr. hart, may i ask this question? in the  i noticed the opinion is a per curiam opinion of the eleventh circuit. was the case argued orally in the eleventh circuit or was it submitted?
but if it's a success, we'll all be rich. now, he decides to tie something to that.
well then, if this provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you argue that it covers the waterfront?
and you would get those eventually, it would just have to happen.
lawful 
no. what shows us that  what shows us that is 
i have two answers to that, justice scalia. i mean, first, in california, you finish your prison sentence, and then parole is a separate period that happens. the california supreme court said, in people v. guzman and other cases, parole is not a part of the sentence 
yes.
your analysis in your brief mingles the two. it says one of the factors that you can take into account in stage one is whether it's retroactive. and as i  i don't understand landgraf to speak that way. i thought you were supposed to use all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding congressional intent, and then you go to stage two, which is where retroactivity comes in.
so that if the issue arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say, yes, we'll assume there was a violation. there would be no reason not to assume that.
the logic is that, for the buyers of those claims, they are meeting the federal standard of "in connection with" 
well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition  i think this is the necessary reading of bacchus  that the commerce clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity  food, milk, et cetera  and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified  maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. and this trial has occurred. you have had that opportunity. i don't see why you have a right to go back.
but i do think it's important, of course, this court's precedents have often said that the degree of the expectation informs the reasonableness of the search. a consent 
and it may  the district court might  may well find that nothing passes constitutional muster in the end.
all right. if that's the same, let's imagine this statute. the statute says, "we bestow upon the social security agency a very limited power." and it says, "this is the limited power. the social security agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under- 10-year-old debts." that's what they say, right in the act.
mr. barnett.
obviously 
and the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.
absolutely.
the question is whether the court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision. we are a court of review. there was no determination of whether the hobbs act included such a category in the seventh circuit. so, the difficulty, the impediment to addressing your position is that however strong it may be, it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the natural order that first the district court speaks, and then the court of appeals, and then it comes here?
would your answer be the same if you added to justice stevens' hypothetical very high barriers of entry that would prevent other competitors from entering the market after the target was driven out?
apparently that's  this has been  this is not really a brand-new statute. we're going back to the '70s 
that's correct, justice scalia.
 much, it has much more impact than a button.
their release from prison presents the same issues that the release of any person who has served the sentences that were imposed after the commission of a crime.
 and law that this court has decided as de novo.
they don't think these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities markets.
but  but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered. and of course, you should abide by the timing rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing within a federal union. if you're  if you're attacking what state a does, go to state a, don't tell state c.
yeah.
thank you, ms. blatt. now, mr. baker.
it's  it's gratuitous when it's beyond what's  what's necessary, and whenever the 
thank you, mr. chemerinsky. the case is submitted.
what about present sense perceptions? that might be a good one.
and i assume your client had no  nothing to say about  about whether the settlement would be  would be accepted by the trustee or not.
no. the states certainly 
certainly. and that is, that is the main point i'm trying to make is that that was the only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction proceeding, was that "i would have liked have raised this argument that i'm generically predisposed to violence." the rest of the argument i think would have been frivolous because it was so obvious that he had restricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his counsel from presenting the very type of evidence that we're talking about now, this other type of evidence.
oh, the missouri pacific case.
yes. that bad news didn't come out until 9 months after the end of the period that you identify for your class. you say the class is april 15th, '97 until february 24th, '98 purchases. the bad news doesn't come out until november of '98. so how could you possibly hook up your loss to the news that comes out later?
and gone to, gone to judgment?
that's right.
 evidence, but 
i think there is. the circuit  the four circuits that we know were unanimous that plra exhaustion is not jurisdictional, and in woodford we know this court confirmed that. and so to the extent that the plra exhaustion is an affirmative defense, then it would operate like other exhaustion schemes in administrative  administrative law, and habeas, where it is waivable by the other side.
apart from those two, access to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment, then anything goes for this set of incorrigible prisoners? they can take away  the first amendment, in other words, is out the window. they have no first amendment rights that the state needs to respect. is that 
if there were 
i think the use of the language "strong inference" carries with it a very significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the buyer.
i mean, you  you can say that its words say that, but what it does doesn't say that. i mean, to establish a prima facie case, all you have to show is that  that you were qualified for the job, you're a member of a minority, and you weren't hired, and somebody who's not a member of a minority was hired. do you think that's enough to show that it's more likely than not that race was the basis and that's  you know, that's how those cases pan out? that's enough for a prima facie case. is that enough to say it's more likely than not that race was the reason?
absolutely. i mean, if this court wants to go the route of justice stewart, which it pointedly rejected, the majority of the court pointed rejected in flast, and say, establishment clause challenges, we're going to relax the normal article iii standard  now, i'm not quite sure where the court gets the authority to relax the normal article iii standards. but assuming that, that would at least be 
he didn't say that, your honor.
that's our basic argument.
thank you, mr. frey. mr. peck.
what i don't understand about the government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (b)i), but don't use it for purposes of (a). you, you don't  in the major computation portions, namely for purposes of paragraph 1, a program of state aid equalizes expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it agency by agency, don't you? you don't apply this, you know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. why don't you do for both?
well, but that's not a rule that they've adopted. all they say is that they're citizens of wherever they're located.
that's correct, justice breyer.
i  with respect, your honor, i don't think it is what the statute says. the statute says, in 3408, "a tax per gallon is hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of fuel." it does not say "the receipt of fuel." "the distributor" is defined as somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers fuel. all of the critical exemptions in the statutes are based on the distributor's subsequent sale or delivery of fuel to the united states, out-of-state, the federal contract 
and that  and that  that's not true  official
thank you, mr. cole. the case is submitted.
i don't see 
 time for rebuttal.
can you tell us where to look in the record for the evidence on that?
are there cases that hold that the natural and probably consequences of purchasing alcohol for a minor could be joyriding?
is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?
 the early common law was 
what happened in the cases 
i 
no?
can you just give me 1 minute on the other issue?
yes, yes, sir 
may i ask 
may i 
i don't think so, your honor, because the definition that was given to this jury was "subvert, undermine, or impede," and not just the integrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding ability of a future proceeding 
in district 23, your honor. thus, the state used race, as we contend, not only to protect an incumbent, but to give the false impression of latino support for that incumbent.
no. i  i understand that the facts were more egregious, but the  the court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint  for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions i think. one is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is  is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that summers provides and under a graham analysis when it comes to force. and there's lots of cases that  that allow officers to do that. lots of lower court cases. in fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. the second thing, the  the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the ninth circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. the ninth circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. it  it applied traditional fourth amendment analysis. and finally and i think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the ninth circuit in  in franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. that's what the policy was in portland. the portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. and the ninth circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because summers and  and graham require it to be individualized justification for that  for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in summers. and in fact, in summers, the court went out of its way to say to compare with what the court was allowing to what it  to  to the circumstances in dunaway, to  to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. and i don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to iris mena, and i think that's one of the  the issues here. if  if the 
that's correct. and the judge could do that, either pre- or post-verdict. that is, pre-verdict, the judge could say, "i think your motion may very well have merit, but, in the interest of overall efficiency, i'm going to submit the case to the jury. but, in the event that the jury comes back against you, i would encourage you to renew that motion." there's nothing wrong with the judge encouraging the litigant to file something like that, or signaling that the judge has doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence. but the rule makes the renewed post-verdict motion a prerequisite to entry of judgment as a matter of law, post-verdict. and it 
660 million includes letters and packages.
i think there is a 
oh, to be sure.
but you'd have to concede at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's gone too because those two claims were intimately related, and you would be precluded from bringing such a claim. so to the extent that there's an overlap, you face a res judicata bar.
will you need to meet the prongs of the brooker test even if you otherwise prove a violation of section 2?
in just the same way that mcculloch the court said that labor standards for a course of business that is regular between honduras and the united states is not going to be sufficient to apply 
then do i get a little certificate to put on the truck to say i did it. i  i registered my icc decal everywhere.
i  i think the other  the other problem that i actually am  that i think the court should be worried about is that this statute sets one  it doesn't say anything about the date on which something is made retroactive. it says it runs from the later of four dates and it then sets forth what those dates are. and it says, the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court, if certain conditions are satisfied. now, that if clause may well raise some  it does raise, i think, some interpretative issues. but however you interpret the if clause, that just tells you whether the petitioner can use that date on which the right was initially recognized or not. if he can't use it, if the if clause is not satisfied, then he's  he only has to show he's timely under one of the other three provisions. the normal one is 1 year from the date that the conviction became final. and i think our primary submission in the case is however you construe the if clause, it can't possibly be read to  whatever interpretative problems there are there, it can't be possibly be read to alter the totally plain language that congress 
i thought the higher education act said  as of what year did the higher education act say, "no statute of limitations applies to us"?
the legal consequences. it's exactly right, justice scalia. if you don't respond to the demand letter, there are no legal consequences. if you don't respond to the letter by filing what's called an "appeal," you lose. and so, it's just like a complaint; you default if you fail to raise your defenses at that point. in addition, section 2415 
 where the money goes and who pays out the money for the ad, that's the difference.
do you think a state could put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt for entrapment, duress, insanity?
and the second question i want you to address at the same time is, what if this was a suitcase that they both owned? they stopped in the airport. the wife says, "i don't want you to open it," and her husband says, "go ahead and open it," or vice versa.
but couldn't the judge in that colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building, a car, or a boat? and he would have said yes, and wouldn't that have satisfied the element of the crime?
the comptroller, your honor.
i think our only concern, justice souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes ambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to the defendant's favor as well as working to the plaintiff's favor. and one concrete example of that in this case are the allegations that concern the titan 5500. there are allegations in this case that there was a study and there were various internal reports that indicated that demand for that product was declining. but the complaint does not specifically allege that that study and those internal reports were even available at the time the ceo made the alleged 
the case is submitted.
but i  i don't think we 
that makes it sound like it can't be considered at all.
 not before enron's problems had begun to become  surfacing in the wall street journal, in the financial press, the stock price was sliding. everybody who was sophisticated in this environment  and surely arthur andersen was  knew that when a fortune 500 company is looking at a potential need to restate its income statements because the accountants have been  proved a black-and-white violation of gaap, and they all knew that that was true, that sec proceedings are likely to occur. even the witness 
what, what is your view of what the component is in this case.
well, i  in  in fact, i don't think that's what happens in michigan, and  and i think the 
yes, yes, or one like that. but is  are those the words? do we need some other words as well? we say practically capable but practically capable has a technical meaning here that it means if there's a close to permanent connection to the land, it doesn't apply?
well, we  we might have to make it in this case.
yes, justice ginsburg. at last count now, 11 state and federal appellate courts have directly rejected the michigan supreme court's reasoning. the idaho court of appeals just joined the list 2 weeks ago, in a  in a case that i  is not cited, because it's so recent. and they have uniformly  i believe all 11 of those cases have said that, "were we to hold otherwise, the knock-and-announce rule would become meaningless," a worry that this court expressed in richards. this court was very concerned, in richards, that simply excluding drug cases from the knock-and-announce rule would make the knock-and-announce rule meaningless. and these courts have noted that statement  the courts that came out  this  the decisions that came out after richards, and have said, "if that is meaningless, then it would be especially meaningless if we were to exclude the entire knock-and-announce rule from the exclusionary rule, that there would be virtually no reason for police officers ever to comply with a knock-and-announce requirement. and so, i think the deterrence rationale is a large part of this, and that's what distinguishes this case from the inevitable-discovery cases, which the michigan supreme court relied on.
i think the  the reservation would remain a reservation. as mr. smith pointed out, with respect to parcels within the reservation that are not owned by indians, the tribe's regulatory authority is extremely limited and, therefore, the tribe would not be able to exercise anything like plenary regulatory jurisdiction over the whole 270,000 acres.
given what the court said in shaw ii.
no. but presumably you would assume that those findings are subsumed within the rule because the judge found in our favor. the judge denied the motion to vacate part of it but granted the reopening to vacate, and of course on the 
yes.
then what you're saying is that this statute, as far as class actions go, changed nothing.
those are the two elements. and so that if you take out with  in the commission of another crime and just left the  the other part of it, would that also be an offense?
well, with respect to the sales-to-sales transactions in which there were 
thank you, counsel.
 drugs? well, are you suggesting that the  the gun portion of the authorization was, in fact, invalid?
and under the agency's theory of this case, there is nothing that stops the does from making their identities public because there is no enforceable contract that the agency can enforce. the agency wants to keep snepp. it wants to live with webster, and the only thing it has left is to somehow carve out a rule that applies to these people who have done everything they possibly could, including not telling me who they are. our files within our office do not identify them in writing, is my understanding, by name. i certainly am not aware of who they are. i know what's alleged in the complaint and nothing more than that. but certainly the risk of gray mail, the risk of the does  people in the does' position disclosing something is totally irrelevant to the question of whether totten creates some sort of bar that applies not just to a contract claim but to a claim where there is no contract, where it is not alleged that it is based upon a contract, and where the parties have done everything possible  the does, the plaintiffs, have done everything possible to honor the confidences that the government wants to keep. thank you, your honors.
roughly speaking  i  i'm  there may be a few dollars and cents that  that aren't accounted for here. but roughly speaking, is it fair to say that the amount that  that you and  and, for that matter, the state attribute to the medicals out of the total settlement is the same proportion that the claim for medicals bore to the total original claim?
well, i'm just asking in the abstract. why wouldn't that always be a  a reasonable factor other than age?
mr. frederick, will  would you please explain something to me that you just said? you said that our complaint isn't about fraud. it isn't about deception. it's about negligence. but the seventh circuit reported and seemed to have no doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation, not mismanagement.
no, go on.
it follows that 2679(b) does not apply, but you're just have  working on a blank slate with no provision of the federal tort claims act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or imposing any kind of judgment bar.
well, i'm sure there have been some instances in which there have been administrative sanctions under title ix. and i don't  i do not have figures on those, justice o'connor. but let me 
that's perfect because then the government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable. so all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with american law, according to them.
there was something you said in  in your brief that i thought was unclear. so may i ask you 
if the 
why  why isn't it a question of as facially in the abstract is it okay?
okay. i will move on to that, and i will not mention that again. (laughter.)
well, i think that's right, and i think that's because there are two steps to our analysis, justice ginsburg. one is, is there a discrete and identifiable expenditure that only arises with respect to religious activities. the second question is, does that particular expenditure, is that particular expenditure an incidental one? flast said incidental expenditures don't give rise to standing. and i think you're right in that situation, that expenditure 
but it's not 
 of the message.
were you, were you surprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant had submitted two false identifications? was the first time you heard about that at trial?
no, your honor.
i don't disagree with that.
but i'm just wondering if you're not discussing a state-law issue that has not been decided by either court below or really fully argued here.
well, i think  i think if, if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum in the state, then that, that might be the category of political speech that could not be regulated.
that is correct. but when people are moved to level 5, your honor, typically they're being moved from level 4, at least more than 90 percent of the time, and level 4 has a similar area of restriction. in reality, i would argue  and i would concur with justice scalia  that this is not a significant or atypical deprivation 
how can you  how can you tease that elaborate system out of  out of the words properly filed but you cannot tease out of it 
 sec?
but don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute? i mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property in guam.
i don't think it's completely inapplicable, your honor, because this case presents the same basic doctrinal question that was presented in grutter, whether a government agency can use race as a classification with a compelling interest with narrow tailoring. this court in grutter identified several benefits of racial diversity. some of those benefits are presented in the elementary and secondary school context. and we have additional benefits that are presented by racial integration.
in, in this case suppose the following circumstance. suppose a federal court has decided in the case of this defendant 
your honor, the fact of the matter is, is that congress has looked at  at this issue, and in the new section that i just referred to, section 703 
so in order for the fcc to decide that there's an action either before the agency or the court, it has to identify a violation of the statute. here it's identified 201(b) as being the provision that's violated. it's absolutely standard for a hundred years that  i mean, mr. fisher says, well, you can't look at 201(b) and decide who is supposed to pay and how much they're supposed to pay. that is absolutely standard from the very beginning of the interstate commerce act, that you can't look at the words "just and reasonable" and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the practices that a carrier is using are just and reasonable. in fact, the whole 
that's correct.
yes.
that's not correct, justice souter. the reason for the variation and the need for additional cement was because the sludge had variations and there was too much liquid in it, which was precisely what mr. stone said. and every one of the witnesses testified to huge variation of the liquid content in the sludge which required more cement, and even the amount of cement that was required was very variable.
mr. srinivasan, you  you alluded a moment ago in  in answering justice ginsburg, i guess, to declarations on file on the tenth circuit case that  that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was  was asking about? did it say  did the declarations say we will have to reduce the x program for the navajo tribe and the y program for the apache tribe and so on, or was it  did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?
well, but isn't the next sentence, the substance of the sentence is "plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that defendants have entered into a contract combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed interstate markets, and agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another." now, does that state a violation of the sherman act?
i  i don't understand that. the rights were all inclusive. as  as i understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it  it used to be  and  and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was  quite  quite restrictive. it's only in more recent  i don't agree with the government's argument that  that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights. but when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's  it's a different question, it seems to me.
 obviously was sent back 
suppose  suppose the company gets a competitive advantage by engaging in the sort of activity that's would be traditionally be associated with organized crime, let's say, extortion or labor offenses. would your causation argument be any different in that situation if a competitor filed a civil rico action?
 he's committed infringement under this patent as i understand it.
they say, "of course you have to make a motion." and, so far, i've heard no response whatsoever to what i'd think is a fairly basic question in this case. and i'm assuming: of course you have to make a motion.
okay. now what's your 
you say very. which economists? i know the chicago school tends to want rule of reason and so forth. professor sherer is an economist, isn't he? worked at the ftc for a long time. a good expert in the field. he points out the drug industry after you got rid of  after you got rid of resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent. the drug stores it went down 20 percent. he says with blue jeans, alone, it saved american consumers $200 million to get rid of it. and his conclusion is, as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. massive.
oh, there's no 
do you have any, i suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the average disposition time is for a petition for certiorari in a case like this?
 position, but it just seems 7 to me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until 8 he's been sentenced. and then he has to go through all 9 the  the questioning as  as to whether or not his 10 prior conviction is  can be set aside, and he has to go 11 to state court to do that.
ms. karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.
where does it say that?
that's exactly right, justice scalia. and this court made clear that it doesn't intervene 
and how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?
 finding, beyond intentional, that the state has to then establish in the penalty phase. two quick points. first, on how this evidence was offered. it was not offered as impeachment evidence. it was not offered under any state statute. if you look in the joint appendix, the second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence. and then there's an accompanying memo that follows. and, also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court, where defense counsel says, "your honor, i made it very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation. it goes to the circumstances of the crime. it's mitigating evidence that someone is not there." and, later, circumstances of the offense is part of the fourth question, which, in oregon, is the mitigation question. if the 
so, can i just take the next step in my hypothetical? the wife and the two adult children who live in the home say, "come on in," and the husband says, "no." what happens then?
so have you been hit in the pocketbook.
because 
 where we are.
 of the united states.
but the fact of the matter is, your honor, the counties aren't preparing the presentences  presentence reports in a timely fashion, and  and they're not sending them 
mr. bailey, you have 1 minute remaining.
that wasn't obvious or visible particularly to the jury.
i guess my point would 
no, well  until the trial 
what about the weekends? i mean, maybe the judge  i  it looks from my calendar  i wondered what day of the week it was. you don't remember. 2/10, february 10, 2004, what day of the week was it?
yes, justice breyer, i agree.
you're saying that it allows rule 11 fees to be imposed 
yes, it is, your honor. i think to the extent that the defendant wants to raise that, he can raise that in a state post-conviction proceeding. he should make that type of argument in the post-conviction proceeding. and that's not what he did here. an analogous situation is that  came up in a case that the defense, that landrigan has cited, iowa versus tovar. and this court expressly noted that the time to raise a claim  that case involved whether it was a counsel  it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea proceeding. and this court noted that the time to raise that is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the burden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue. and here if you look at the, the petition for post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit that mr. landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in there that suggests that "i did not understand what i was doing when i instructed my counsel not to present mitigation. i, i did not understand the concept of mitigation." there's nothing in there to suggest that. so i would 
that is true, justice ginsburg. and congress, in this act, was very careful to basically write without prejudice to the answer to that question. so, we would have that argument. the other side would have their argument. what this act provides that we don't have any argument on, that was something that wasn't before this court, say, in the rasul decision, was the fact that the procedures that the military has promulgated are going to be enforceable under this exclusive review provision. so, there at least will be some law to apply now under this exclusive review provision.
no. the supreme court of california said that it was not deciding the federal  the fifth amendment federal constitutional question. but they  they concede that all of the issues that make up the  the federal constitutional question were fully and fairly litigated in the california courts except the question of whether the fifth amendment, as opposed to the california takings provision, is entitled to 
well, our argument is pinned on this court's decisions in turner and o'lone, which we see as establishing the baseline for what type  for what the constitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison, and then we use that baseline and compare the standard imposed there to the standard congress is seeking to impose through rluipa and compare the magnitude of the two, understanding, as this court has said in lemon, that lines of demarcation are difficult to perceive. it's difficult to say exactly where that line should be.
sloppiness. sloppiness. how about that as a reason, sloppiness that appears throughout the rest of this  of this piece of legislation?
no, justice o'connor. my  my basic answer to that is that this court already addressed that issue in procunier. it considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, i think in this case it's actually a  a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the ninth circuit specifically addressed the issue. it looked at under saucier. it evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and  and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. so if i  if i cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously i  i hope i can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there  that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.
well, the difference in connick is that the employee  the prosecutor in that actions spoke more closely with a citizen, and the government  -
well, if that's the relief that the  the prisoner was seeking, i think that is clearly a habeas claim. but that's not what johnson is claiming in this case. he's not asking for entitlement to release at all. he's asking for the processes to be changed prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking for declaratory relief.
why is that different? because this 
and this is an order. "you're  boom, "pay."
well, the 
but if  if you assume  you assume the correctness of the allegations, which you  you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to payment. isn't that correct? so if you take them in terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will have clients and they can bring this  this issue on behalf of the client.
it did not, your honor.
yes, your honor. and this court said, in seminole tribe, that the article 1 powers could not be used to take away, or to abrogate, the states' sovereign immunity. now, obviously, section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to do it, but there is no suggestion that congress used section 5 of the fourteenth amendment in enacting its attempt to abrogate sovereign immunity.
you don't think the psr has some kind of significance that the police report did not?
well, they weren't concentrating on the damage to them, they were concentrating on the facilitation of copying that was provided. and you don't question that this service does facilitate copying.
ms. 
well, this particular bankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with this particular debtor, having presided over the first case as well, justice ginsburg. so i think the bankruptcy court was very fully apprised of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case, with the record and having written several opinions already in the first bankruptcy case which was still pending.
that was presented in the state court proceedings.
the main holding in smith was that the foreign country exception applied. that's all they held in smith, wasn't it?
do you  do you think the establishment clause issue in this case would be the same as the establishment clause issue in city of boerne if we  if the court had reached the establishment clause issue in that case?
i mean, like, you know, try the right to bear arms. (laughter.)
your honor, i'm not claiming any exceptionalism for the law schools. the aaup brief does 
that's true, yes, that there's no competing will.
they may assume it 
have the lower courts addressed that issue?
well, but it's a limited privacy right, of course. these people have a warrant, right?
no. we're talking about the contract between us and the government because it's that contract that contains the reimbursement terms, and when the enrollee enrolls in the federal program, he or she takes on the obligation of complying with all the terms of the government contract.
thank you, ms. robin-vergeer. ms. lee, you have 3 minutes remaining.
10  (laughter.)
that's right, and from what i can 16 tell from the department of justice statistics, there are 17 even fewer number of convictions in those states, and best 18 i can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe i 19 think less than 10 people per year.
 page 65a of our brief. but let me  let me be 
in rejecting 
 the case didn't involve it?
well, let's take one specific example that the petitioners did, and that is this matter of the channel stuffing. they say here's a notion, channel stuffing. it could mean goods were shipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean something different. it could mean discounting and other incentives to get people to buy. so there's good channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds like good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's at issue.
 be waived? can that be waived? and did texas raise that issue in the fifth circuit at all?
but we do know, don't we, mr. gartlan, that if the treaty had been followed, it still would have been permissible for the police, having given miranda warnings, to commence interrogation? the treaty does not require that the enforcing officials in this country immediately call the foreign consulate. isn't that so?
it is a  but it  yes, your honor, that is the protection.
but, in any event, the 
and why should we decide the constitutional question?
and if the odds are he was, they win in the absence of any evidence.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
yes, but is the criterion "characteristically," or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?
you don't know that.
is there something better about reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land smuggling?
as i heard mr. donahue, he official was talking about wepco. understand the context of wepco. wepco was a situation where every one of the changes was a modification within the meaning of nsps. and then the question is were they also modification  major modifications within the  within the meaning of the psd. and that's what they analyzed. so it didn't say anything about the argument we've been making which is what is a modification. the only statements that i know of that are out there are the two reich statements which i just quoted to you, says exactly our interpretation. but even more powerful at least in my view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the state of alabama and the 12 states that relied on the region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that amicus brief and the answer, the question is  you know  how do you determine what is a modification? you know does something that doesn't increase the hours, the emissions per hour, constitute it? it says no. since the modification does not cause any increase in the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual emissions should be calculated. they could not have said that any more clearly than 
if  i  i think that if the documents recording the guilty plea indicate that the  that the crime described is the crime described in the warrant application, you probably could look at that if  to determine if it was a boat or a building or 
no. the trial was  i'm making an observation just as in  as in atkins 
this court 
 applied not just against the college here, but against the 
my specific point is once he has made it plain  and this is all that texas law itself says is required  once he has made it plain that he objects to a special verdict form which cannot allow for the consideration of mitigating evidence, and this court's holding is that that is precisely the error in this case, that no supplemental nullification instruction could correct, he has plainly made clear what his objection was and there was nothing else he could do.
wasn't there  wasn't there something to the effect that "micro pigmentation" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? it's another name for permanent make-up, and it's  it has "micro" in it, "micro pigmentation."
yes.
which opinion are you talking about? i missed it  missed it.
i don't  when we start establishing benchmarks and presumptions, i think that's where we, we 
 that it reserved, or is the rule that it is clear that congress ought to have reserved it?
so, if he thinks, "look, i've been having a bad time with my wife. i think she's going to consent and let the police in if i'm not"  then his objection shouldn't control?
mr. rovelli, do the other prisoners know about this? i'd like you to respond to the  to the assertion that nobody knows about this anyway, so it doesn't deter anybody.
but the analysis is whether there was a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the court's instructions so as to preclude consideration of payton's mitigating evidence, and that 
well, i have two answers to that, your honor. first would be, that's inconsistent with the language utilized by this court in carey where the court defined pending as until final resolution through the state's post-conviction 
well, a couple of points about that. i mean, the first is the deterrent function of damages is really essential in this context. i think that's the import of the record of constitutional violations. section 1983 failed. i think the second point about damages is, they're very limited in the prison context. they're limited by this court's decision in barnes, no punitives. they're 
you couldn't finish that answer. i want to know it.
what is the conceptual basis for saying that jury discharge makes the difference? why is that the touchstone?
thank you, mr. kaplan. thank you. your time is up.
you can have private delivery of mail. can you? well, that's a  but what  what even more  what about a  a warehouse? i mean, it's where they keep the  the money bags or whatever. (laughter.)
well, that's  the new trial comes in, by the courts that have said this, only  they'd say, "we would direct the entry of judgment for the verdict loser, but we're powerless to do that." and that is all wrapped up in the seventh amendment. so, the next best thing is, we grant a new trial.
no 
 not.
what i had said is that california does enforce its 
well, it has to be extracted at some point to be  to get into  i'm right here  to get into the tea, right? it's extracted by the preparation of the tea.
are  are you saying that the only basis on  on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the  the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?
but that was the end of it at the trial court.
does he have any action that is other than piecemeal?
that is correct. our position is that the choice of what vehicle the institution wants to permit through which inmates can gain access to what is occurring outside of the prison walls in political and other public matters, that's the institution's choice. and the reason these inmates sued for access to newspapers and magazines is because the representative plaintiff, mr. banks, was allowed to receive his christian science monitor magazine because it was religious in nature, but was denied the opportunity to receive his christian science monitor newspaper under  under this policy. there's another very important 
well, i mean, your point is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long enough, right? and that's why they don't win a lot of these cases. but the same thing is going to be true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is the exclusion of the evidence. the court is going to be very  it's going to be very difficult to tell if they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court is likely to say, you know, "let it go."
thank you, mr. hungar. ms. sullivan.
i doubt  i doubt whether professor davenport has misdescribed the case in  in his brief, but i 
that's right. and there was no screening mechanism in united states against armstrong. the court made it very clear that what you were applying there were ordinary equal protection standards.
thank you, mr. hungar. mr. estrada, it's your turn now.
and i imagine because there are different forms of retaliation  sometimes it's a discharge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming the person for his next employer, it might be a tort, they beat him up or something, there could be a lot of different kinds of retaliation  each of which would give rise to a different statute of limitations under state law. does that seem reasonable?
and  and 
and, once 
suppose it were just left up to the law. are there problems in computing what cure and maintenance 
the statute does not prohibit the disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not require the disclosure of reports. the tax court in 1984 amended the rule to make perfectly clear that  that initial reports of special trial judges are not to be disclosed. the tax court said in its orders in this case the reason for that is that those are now internal deliberative processes. the tax court has made clear that its rules permit exactly what it's doing here.
as a result of his initial  having reentered 
 don't let felons vote. i mean, that's a punishment that they impose after they're out of prison.
would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?
right. i 
i understand that. what about 19 and 24?
and we're going to eliminate the cattlemen's beef board and all of these things 
did you suggest to the federal court that it certify the question of the meaning of colorado law to this colorado supreme court?
with respect to conspiracy? yes, i have. and i do believe the text says that they're referring to domestic offenses. it's certainly the case that conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws of war at some point in the civil war. but that has been entirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have rejected it everywhere. and if you adopt the government's reading, justice stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time in 1916, then i believe there goes the government's case entirely, because the thrust of the government's case is the laws of war have to adapt to this stateless, territoryless organization known as al qaeda. if we're playing by 1916 rules, there is no way that this commission would have been accepted in 1916. now, all of those jurisdictional pretrial challenges were accepted by the courts below when the full panoply of dta rights  when the full panoply of rights existed. now the dta certainly circumscribes the scope. we don't know whether question one very clearly is able to be raised after the dta's enactment. we certainly  question two, as the solicitor general has said, is not raisable. we don't know when it can be raised, because the president can block final review for all time under the dta. he has the keys to the federal courthouse. and if you defer to this system and give the president the ability to launch all of these tribunals for 75 individuals with these charges, with these procedures, you will be countenancing a huge expansion of military jurisdiction. conspiracy is one of the few offenses, justices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war internationally in tribunal after tribunal. it's certainly never been approved by a federal court. and, indeed, it has been rejected. in colepaugh, for example, no challenge to conspiracy was raised. the government's argument, in the end, it seems to me, is one that this court rejected in loving, because it depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the president has ultimate flexibility with respect to these military commissions, except for the nine provisions in the ucmj which govern translators and deposition testimony. it is inconceivable that the ucmj, when enacted, intended to regulate military commissions with only that bare bones to it. indeed, general crowder said, "military commissions and courts-martial follow the same procedures." finally, justices, we'd just point out that the predicate of abstention is not met here. this is not a ordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary procedures. this is an ad hoc trial in which the procedures are all defined with the president. he says the laws of war do not apply when we're talking about protecting this vulnerable individual at guantanamo. but then he says they do apply and permit him to charge mr. hamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at international law. it was a great american patriot, thomas paine, who warned, "he who  that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if he violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach unto himself." that's what we're asking you to do here, just enforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the historic role of this court. thank you.
mr. 
thank you.
isn't there evidence that the, basically that the rise of the wal-marts and the targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade? so  that there's that correlation.
well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a new jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in new york, or a new york wholesaler wanting to sell in new jersey?
yes, in 1966, your honor. the state of the law at the time when the congress was deciding how to write this provision, there was certainly no authoritative pronouncement that, that the, that third parties could bring a suit, and indeed the law that 
well, i would have stopped sooner, your honor. i would have said, "i will take it under advisement." that is really the essence of the rule, that the court has this under advisement. and it is a very common 
 how do we get to that conclusion. now, it seems to me what you've done is say either use my ad hoc mechanism, or let there be chaos, or we take your approach which produces the kind of chaos we've just been discussing.
it covers joyriding?
we wouldn't bring the case, your honor.
in any court. and i think when someone 
the district  (laughter.)
well, how could the issue be pressed? i mean, it had already been decided by the supreme court. i mean, what  what could the state say to the trial court?
yes.
then essentially it's just a political check on it. when you say there's got to be a good reason, politically people would get mad if you didn't have a good reason; is that basically it?
money goes to a state.
if those statements weren't introduced at trial 
how long does it usually take to file a responsive pleading?
is the scow a vessel too?
because they relied upon what they 18 themselves knew was a remarkably set of sources, a family 19 and a client who were not willing to discuss the 20 information when they knew records were available that 21 would have discussed the life history. turning to the simmons issue, justice kennedy, 23 the core of the simmons issue, the core debate before the 24 court, is what does justice o'connor's concurring opinion 25 in simmons mean. the 
so all it takes is a  is a single decision by the state supreme court which says that our rule is no broader than the federal constitutional requirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal to state law.
after that, our client was effectively on lockdown and had no access whatsoever to the library. now, this presents the burden problem with doing any sort of independent determination. the attorney general suggested, in the district court, that there was a paging system in place whereby prisoners who are on lockdown could get access to the library. there was never any suggestion in the district court on the part of the attorney general that the lockdown didn't exist. and the attorney general, and not my client, would have access to those records.
you're assuming somehow the transcript has been disclosed.
they seem to have made a mistake here quite a lot. why do these statistics come out the way they do? i mean, it is just as easy.
i did want this court to get to that question, but when this court rejected question 2, i think this court decided that it did not want to get to that question. but we  and we did not brief that question because this court did not grant certiorari on question number 2. but we definitely did want this court to decide that question, and obviously, if  since the court can't decide it in this case, we would, obviously, want the court to decide it in some other case, hopefully before this case is finally resolved in the courts.
what  what about the eeoc having typed the question jurisdictional for administrative processing purposes?
well 
it does strike me as self-evident. in fact, to courts below  we have  we've made this argument. we've seen this argument now. the cases have called it intuitively obvious. and from the discussion of  in the scheiner case and from the discussion in the nippert case, the very difference between interstate and intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate carrier is just not going to use the state's facilities as much as the in-state carrier.
mr. brunstad, are you going to address the mootness point? do you think the case is moot?
as you respond to justice breyer's question, would you go the step further and say, why isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're having about government speech a requirement that if you want to justify it as government speech, you put in the advertisement, "this is the government's position, paid for by the beef producers"?
even  even if you assume that von raab decided it, you have a quite different situation here. the issue isn't whether there will be any judicial review. the issue is whether there will be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are  that are not  for which judicial review was not provided. any major employee action  judicial review, as i understand it, is available, and it is only relatively insignificant actions for which judicial review is not available. isn't that right?
yes.
i thought you said the merits of the issue was not going to be decided by the federal court.
oh yes. when they joined together in anti-terrorism, effective  the  just the word effective was plenty to convey to us what they actually mean. the other big problem that's not been addressed is these people in a practical sense do not have the same lawyer for both proceedings. many people who were more than willing to practice in state court are not willing to practice in federal court. it's a more formalized, rigorous endeavor. and in this case what happened was mr. lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and obviously must have prepared for him that initial place holder, if you want to call it, 2254, because it's typewritten. they cite to a westlaw site. i don't think there is any way that anyone can contemplate that that would be mr. lawrence's doing in his own right. also, whether it's 90 days or six months as your honor has said, it's always in the control of this court. once the 90  this is not a frolic of unnumbered years. when someone files a petition he either files it by the time 90 days is over or he is out of court, or he files it and this court is quickly reviewing it after some input from the other side.
well, you have to look at the particular context.
the officials have deemed that that is an appropriate policy. i think the record is a bit scant in this case.
the property is an entitlement to enforcement of her order. that's the property, your honor. that's how it was 
yes, but to get to the unconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look to the first amendment?
otherwise you have a supreme court decision that the state court can say, thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but we  there was a procedural default here. although we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to bypass it after the supreme court has told us what the federal law is.
reasonably diligent efforts to find a better address and if a better address 
i 
 it's not a more generalized tort. if want to call it a tort, it is a tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce contracts. i don't see anything 
but she withdrew it after he observed the straw.
no, because  and  and again, this  this is  this is because of the  of the background of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that i  that i'm talking about.
and if you don't show that as a  as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.
so that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.
well, it's our position that it wasn't  they didn't raise that issue in  in the court of appeals. they didn't raise the sixth amendment issue in the court of appeals. they didn't raise that issue in their cert petition here, and so it's  it's not covered by the  by the question presented. so it is the position that we've  that we've set out in the brief that it should not be  it should not be held pending that  that disposition in booker and fanfan.
i think that it does cover this case, and 
well, that's my question. there is no 
okay. in that respect, doesn't it differ from erisa?
it's  it's removable if the only question was whether notice was given. but if the question is was sufficient notice given such as to transfer title under federal law, then that's removable.
i thought the descriptions that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and the subsequent release that the water emerges in this unnatural state, in this striated state that justice kennedy was referring to.
your honor, there is no  there's no requirement in the preemption provision either for a conflict. i mean, congress went back to the  to the drafting table in 1998 and said, we want state law to be preempted whether or not there's a conflict in this particular situation. so 
 30,000 feet, it's all 
fifty-one.
well, do  do you agree that the california standard is more rigorous than the standard applied by the federal courts and by most state courts?
well, this is a little different. he  i mean, when you shackle somebody who hasn't yet been convicted, you  you send a message to the jury that, you know, this  this person belongs in irons. but the jury had already found this person guilty.
i think that simply a plain reading of the rule and looking at the rule as a whole would preclude that result. and the reason is that the  the specific language that  that your honor is referring to speaks in terms of shortening or extending the time, the time being the 7-day period for issuance. that 7-day period is simply a period to allow the clerk a window of time to get the mandate out after the rehearing period has expired or after the rehearing has been disposed of. but it does not give the court carte blanche to simply withhold the mandate.
ms. brill, i thought your brief said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies to those countries that have similar protection for us.
and i could 
yes.
no, but did 
 we know what it is. there's a state statute of limitations. it says 
i think that, the problem i guess that i have with your argument, is that the theory of taylor and as carried forward in shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense. and when aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that regardless of what the actual count is, even on your count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it. and i have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, form an element of a generic offense when it is  or a generic concept of the offense  when it is a minority view.
thank you, ms. blatt. you have about 4 minutes.
yes, your honor. the record in this case indicates that  for instance, with the use of graphic script questioning, the  of the six  again, of the six challenged jurors, four did not receive the graphic script at the outset of voir dire.
i think largely they are.
your honor 
well 
two answers, justice ginsburg. first, a lot of times, the plaintiffs have already started these lawsuits of these claims long before  when the state has just started getting up the process of paying the medical bills. and car accidents and stuff can get taken care of pretty quickly. and the  the second point is, is that the state  the state may  needs the help of the beneficiary to bring this suit.
it was found that there was not a connection.
so if they don't get the  recover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still get a very handsome reward for what happened to them.
yes.
 i mean, how do you make that distinction? i mean, it's like the  you know, the cheshire cat and a  and the smile; you can't distinguish the two. there was one entry, and that entry violated the knock-and-announce rule.
excuse me, i don't  i don't understand what you just said. you mean, it would be enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis for dismissing the suit. is that 
 including any money owed to the other  to the other state institutions. you acknowledged that that 
yes, your honor.
thank you, mr. rashkind. the case is submitted.
well, justice scalia, i actually have two responses to that. first, this is intentionally aimed at the poor. looking at 770.3a, the statute under  in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent. it refers to the indigent. so this is a statute that on its face is  is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have  have an attorney. so i don't agree that is is a  simply a disparate impact case. but in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this court's cases have  have not applied the same line of analysis that this court has applied in other contexts, and i think that's quite clear most recently in the mlb case 
well, yes, but 
why, because you satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?
who  who should  whose responsibility should it be to get something like that into the record? i mean, i read it. i don't  i have no idea whether there was a good reason for the shackling or not.
and the  and the fifth circuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the defense shuffled more times, as i 
that's not an allegation that's  i mean, it is either true or it's not true. the fact that you find out after he's left, after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, i don't see how that should affect the validity of his allegations.
thank you, mr. joseffer. mr. flores.
 you that.
 could you 
but it was not just definiteness, your honor. it was section 112. but let me get to the morse case because as we have explained in our reply brief and, in fact, in our opening brief, the morse case was in fact decided under what is now section 112. the court cited and quoted the relevant statute which has not changed in any material respect today. the court made clear that the problem in that case, at page 120 of the opinion, was that morse claims what he has not described in the manner required by law. and what we have here is the same situation. we have these patentees who are indisputably entitled to patent their innovative method for measuring homocysteine. and labcorp continues to use that method sometimes and we pay royalties whenever we use that method. but what they couldn't do is what samuel morse tried to do and push the envelope, and try to effectively patent the natural phenomenon associated with all homocysteine tests and thereby gain a monopoly over just not the one that they invented, not just those that are in the prior art, which itself would be impermissible, but even yet to be invented assays. and here is the nub of this case. labcorp has sought to use but has been penalized for using and is prevented from using a more efficient and cost-effective method for assaying homocysteine than the one that these patentees invented. the method that labcorp seeks to use, which is the abbott method, reduces the processing time for homocysteine tests down from what was up to 18 hours under the patentee's method down to a manner of minutes.
i think without question, your honor. what congress, we are arguing, did not approve is the removal of that state law quiet title action to federal court under arising-under jurisdiction merely because of the presence of a federal issue as an element of the state law claim.
we think the  we think the formal legal control is sufficient. and it  the secretary has the responsibility to approve  under the statute  to approve budgets, to approve contracts, and to approve projects. and usda does, in fact, go beyond that and determine whether particular advertisements will be  will be issued. but we think it's only necessary to look what the statute requires. but the testimony in this case shows that, in any event, usda is extensively involved in the development of the advertising under this statute, by extensive consultations with the operating committee and the beef board in the development of the project. so there  this is an integrated effort within the department of agriculture.
oh, i disagree, justice souter. e(3) specifically preserves the claim that the commissions were not, and the procedures were not, consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states 
that's correct.
correct.
but a simple cry for help that doesn't say i'm being battered may not elicit an immediate response on the part of the police. this kind of call, i need help now, and the information that comes with it is likely to be given priority attention as this very call was.
our point is not that 924(c) requires a conviction when it's in the immigration act, it's that the immigration consequences of that incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an aggravated felony.
well, i  i would agree there, but we're not  this  this isn't a case about subjecting them to suit.
no, your honor, for a couple of reasons. first of all, in citizens publishing, that did not exist. this court did not abolish the joint venture there. what it did was it cut out the price-fixing part of it only. just as the lower court said, the joint venture there does not depend upon 
 profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or  or contract. it's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?
well, i don't think it really said they  they found there was a security risk. they  they held the government did not have to explain because the man had no right to come in.
i must say, this 
 all that would be required to allege, to take the four-line complaint  all that the plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, "the train was negligently operated," with nothing more specific than that. and then the particulars could come out later. under habeas, you can't do that. you must set out your grounds, and the  rule 2 is very specific about that. so, it's a very different approach to what you have to allege, going in.
yes, justice breyer. the problem with assuming that a union will take a claim like this to arbitration is the following. unions generally do not take individual employee grievances to arbitration, especially if you look at this collective bargaining agreement, which requires the union to pay the costs if they lose. now, on a claim like this, for the very reason that you suggested earlier, it may be difficult to figure out what the facts are.
i mean, that's the interest that we're concerned with, is of having the government have the capacity to be able to control the speech of its employees so they could have a consistent policy and so that it can explain to the people what it's doing.
 the school district did come forward. and is that the usual practice in these administrative hearings  that the first one to go to defend the plan is the school district, not the parents who are attacking it?
my  my point is that's not the exclusive basis. i'm not saying that it's inapplicable to this category. but 
i want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical. (laughter.)
i  i beg your pardon. i didn't hear the names of the cases.
 they think they have a better claim on the other part. i mean, if  even if you're right in this one, i promise you, the next one will come along, and they'll say, "of course we had a good reason for firing him. one, we didn't fire him for that reason. two, if we did, we would have been justified," or whatever. so 
no, it does not. but what the court said in crawford was that the term witness was referring to  that people can make testimonial statements 
your honor, what this  what the california supreme court did, in this 
of course you have to show that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. that's a strong phrase. we said it in stringer  stringer versus black. but if it has a new application, that's  that's new. even though the principle is the official same.
so what about the argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final decision in the state court and that it makes sense to treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to the exhaustion requirement?
that's correct. and i think that's 
as far as i know, your honor, the procedure followed here was the standard procedure when the conference report takes bills and essentially amalgamates them or redrafts them 
thank you, general clement. the case is submitted.
 if there's nothing to outweigh the aggravating factors.
the  the special trial judge has no tenure, does she?
you say at this point in time? are you suggesting that it took a different position some other time?
 what factors, in your view, can be considered. the 
yes.
you're saying more than that is necessary.
well, i don't know what scholars would have said about it 
this is a 12(b)(1) and a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, mr. chief justice, because it's also a jurisdictional issue, so it is possible. they came forward with these reliance affidavits, and i think it's significant how little they say. the reliance affidavits would obviously not require any discovery on their part to indicate what their actions were, in terms of 
fine  it would be problematic?
yes.
 but you're 
i don't want to take up your time on rebuttal but i have to ask you, do you have an explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?
 of the offense.
well, would it help? suppose we were to say it was  had to be capable, at least, of having a captain and crew?
can we get back  i'm sorry.
okay.
sure, and our government has demonstrated that it believes in preemptive  preemptive action and we can go in and have regime change in cuba if it  if it is such a threat. if it's a political decision, the purely executive decision, that our national security is so threatened, they have all kinds of tools.
can you tell us what the state of oregon has done in this regard 
well, if we're talking about capital cases here, they are  they are filing their appeals directly in the california supreme court; similarly, with their habeas petitions.
it has to be.
well 
well, there's  it depends on what you're talking about.
he 
i don't see how that undermines their point that when congress wants to specify that something "shall apply prospectively only," as they quote, "only with respect to entries occurring on or after a date," they spell it out. and they did not similarly spell it out in the provision on  that you suggest is prospective only.
so it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?
when you say that it may be relevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)? because 2680(a) says, you know, if you exercise due care, any act that you take in the  in  well, let's use the exact language  "any act or omission in the execution of a statute or regulation will not be a ground of liability," with  at least leaving open the door that any failure to take steps that would have been reasonable in executing it might be. is that why you answered justice stevens as you did?
your honor, if i might respond to that.
why wasn't there warning? there were lights, there were sirens. surely the defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.
 from engaging in interstate commerce, in the event, for example, that you found there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an interstate transaction, i think we would have  the commerce clause would be implicated. but as a practical matter, they would be able to accomplish much the same thing because most people would take the free service.
why? if it  if it  if it  it doesn't go to the suspicionless character of the search, but it does say it has to be reasonable in time, place, or manner.
but did you use at trial anything that he provided you?
ms. brill, in the court of appeals, they treated the argument that this was not property as entirely separate from the revenue rule question. and i thought your petition for cert was confined to the first question.
thank you, mr. kennedy  justice kennedy. in this instance, the ninth circuit professes fealty to aedpa deference, but it seems simply too easy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to become willing to attribute error to the state court and to substitute its own factual inferences for those of the trial judge. the way the court decides this case can provide further instruction to habeas courts to help them avoid the ninth circuit error. i'd suggest at least four instructions that might be considered. first, confirming that the objective reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like that currently under (d)(1). that is, the factual inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more deferential than review for clear error. second, since it seems logical that state fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not greater, respect than that now accorded state court resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), we've argued for adoption of the jackson v. virginia kind of standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of aedpa, meaning that witness credibility determinations rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the factfinder. third, although miller-el v. dretke represented an extraordinarily egregious and i personally think undeniable violation of batson, some might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a miller-el fire. proper resolution of this case can make it clear that miller-el v. dretke dealt with a outlier and that the traditional line of this court's habeas cases, restricting federal courts from second-guessing a state judge's credibility calls, retain their vitality. finally and specifically responding to mr. collins' argument that this case, it seems, is an opportunity to confirm the well-established presumption of correctness for state court fact finding under section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all habeas cases. collins' view that the traditional presumption now applies only in the rare case of federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the traditional presumption. in my office 
all right. i'll be candid with you. i think it is necessary. but the  i guess the  what i'm getting at in all of this is you're asking us to take steps to solve a problem, and i don't think you've demonstrated what the problem is. we keep coming back, as we have several times, to the lack of empirical studies. have we got something to worry about in  in enforcing fourth amendment values that we can only guard against if we go your way?
it  there is nothing that i can point you to that shows there is an empirically evidence that the government is not going to be able to deal with this burden. but what i would say to you is that you should take the same approach that the court took in the diana case many years ago, which is it did not want to establish a regime that invites manufactured claims.
and that's an important point. congress doing it does not open the controlled substances act to the individualized determinations by 700 district courts. it makes 
i  i'd like your help on this. your interpretation of totten  does it say that there is just no actionable contract, or does it say there's no jurisdictions like political question? i mean, you win under any of those theories, if we accept them. but which is it?
was there a motion for summary judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law, they should be entitled to qualified 
as to the national bank?
thank you, mr. minear. mr. alioto.
 be trying to do the same thing 
well, your honor 
well, mullane said that we look to what a person who really wanted to find the person would do. a person who really wanted to find mr. jones and got the certified letter back saying, nobody is claiming this, would have done something more.
well, i wouldn't do that.
i  i don't have any specific authority to the contrary, although the other side didn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation here. and i don't see anything in this court's rules which broadly authorize the court to grant certiorari to any question that's fairly subsumed within the question presented. and it is a totally artificial inquiry to sit here and say, you know, how are we going to analyze what is 
so neither the, neither the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first goof up?
well, so this finding  the court shouldn't have made these findings? it was irrelevant?
 that's why i said that it would be subject to a pretext analysis. the employer, of course, might come back and  and, post hoc, come up with a rationale for 
maybe. i mean, judges are very busy. not all the prosecutors get the word. it's very hard to ask district judges to raise something on their own in the face of lawyers who are telling them the opposite. so you say, oh, they'll all know. i've noticed there are a lot of opinions we write that they don't know about  (laughter.)
well, in this case now, the 19 petitioner did obtain a vacatur of the two state 20 convictions. isn't that so? don't we accept that as a 21 fact in this case?
wisconsin v. mitchell, your honor. in that case the wisconsin supreme court was found by this court not to have constructed the statute, but to have made an assessment of its practical effects, and this court found it was not bound. similarly in teller, a case more directly relevant to this case, the state supreme court found that the bar association of california is a governmental agency and this court declined to follow the state supreme court of california and found that in fact it was not.
it's a partnership theory when you talk about two persons joining together. i don't like this  this gold mine view of litigation, that it's, you know, like two prospectors. you know, there's money to be obtained. (laughter.)
i think the answer to your question depends upon facts that you haven't stated. if the original joint venture is a sham for a horizontal arrangement 
and the united states is treated the same in relation to all federal employees. i mean, there's  there's an interest in uniformity for fairness among employees, and there's an interest in the united states in having the same expectation, in this case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where the employee is.
i believe the petitioner came up with that formulation because they had taken on the burden because they were the movant on summary judgment. that's where that misnomer came from.
 if we're talking 
we don't know how many people paid  paid off the plaintiff. we  you know, frivolous litigation becomes evident only when it proceeds far enough that it's  it's reported. what  what i assume would happen most often is that the  the person who has the patent would just say it's just not worth the litigation. here. go away. we don't know how much of that there is.
okay. so if we accept that extra step, that's  that gets you  if  if we accept the extra step that gets you parallel to the  to the ad that we considered in mcconnell.
i don't think so, justice kennedy. i think it's more of a characterization disagreement. there  it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be  to be turned over.
well, that  that would mean that  that you would have to make public the  the reports of a regular tax court judge in cases that then go on to the full court. and that's not done, is it?
is it affirmative action?
well, justice souter, i read that passage of the second circuit decision as not expressly referencing the plausibility requirement. there is language saying that the allegation needs to be plausible but when you get to this specific passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be no set of facts that could be proved. but regardless, even if i am, your interpretation is potentially permissible interpretation, the fundamental concern of the united states is that this court, having the case now, clarify that a section 1 sherman act complaint should not be able to survive a motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond mere generic parallel action.
that  the fungibility issue is in this case, but the  but a  the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. or 
but, justice breyer, they wouldn't convict him for murder, because he would qualify for an insanity defense. and somebody as insane as you're 
48.
i happen to agree with the petitioner. there is more than three versions of the ten commandments. and the purpose, if you go back to what the eagles were trying to achieve here, was to come up with a version of the ten commandments that wasn't reflective of any particular religion.
of course, what the other side says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they  what they 
does adolescence as a scientific term  does it always occur on the same day for  for all individuals?
no, that was not the case, your honor. the  the grounds for that was the belief that there had been undue influence with respect to the will. but the inter vivos gift claim  a tortious interference with inter vivos gift claim  that was added only many years later in the year 2000. that was 3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was pending in the bankruptcy court. and the only reason it was raised at that time was that respondent went to the federal court and said  and interposed the probate exception and argued at that time there is no jurisdiction here. therefore, out of an excess of caution, our client went to the texas probate court and said, well, i will  i will make this  this claim here. in fact, once there was success in the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now i have made a determination on that claim, our client did dismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims with respect to the probate estate. i think the important thing to realize here, with respect to both this particular claim and with respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in particular, is that the  that the breadth of the  what that statute does is, it  it announces that rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there will be preclusions based on abstention. it has broad abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention 
i don't know. that's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is i see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear oregon state law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera.
i mean, you read 
well, unlike medtronic where preemption occurred by virtue of the fda's regulation, under fifra there's preemption by virtue of the statute itself. and i just want to give one 
 i think we're both saying the same thing
justice scalia, i agree with your framing of the issue.
it is in that  that statute, yes.
that 
well, he says 
excuse me. under direct review? is 
well, your honor, i  i guess maybe it depends on how you look at the word threshold. i mean, i would think that that is the core issue in the dispute. i mean, certainly there  you are absolutely right that there could be some ancillary issues like damages. but clearly, the  the nub, the crux of their challenge here is a challenge to the legality of the underlying contract. and under their view, they get to obtain judicial resolution of that issue in the first instance, notwithstanding the fact that they don't dispute that they agreed to arbitrate all issues relating not only to the validity of the arbitration clause itself, but relating to the underlying contract. so there's no question here  and i think this is really important not to lose sight of  that this dispute falls within the plain language of their arbitration provision. if you look at joint appendix 42, the arbitration provision here is very broadly worded in this regard, and the parties clearly agreed to do it. the only question is basically whether the state could frustrate the  the plain, express intent of the parties by saying, oh, well, this challenge implicates arbitration  implicates legality.
okay.
your honor, both the eeoc test, as well as our test, is one based upon a reasonable person under all of the circumstances. and  and the trial courts frequently say under this set of 
 from the guard 
yes, but 
must there be good reasons for the judge to say, quote, "i'm surprised that you haven't raised a statute of limitations defense"?
as a flat fee?
yes, but active inducement is a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional encouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?
they were admitted over his objection, and that was taken up on direct appeal to the florida supreme court, and the florida supreme court, in nixon i, did not find that they were inflammatory and found that their introduction was proper. justice
it's raising a possibility. i don't know what level of possibility it is other than a reasonable inference level, which is a level which  which means that it's subject to some belief.
were these decisions post-johnson.
but the relief that he requested was to do a little more testing to see whether he was being tested more than the average person, as i understand it.
 to do so.
your honor, i believe that that really is this case. there is nothing in the complaint that says this is a facial challenge, and we only want a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional and enjoin it in its entirety, and if we can't have that, we want nothing else. we expect 
we have to look beyond the president's interpretation of the treaty. it happens that the president is interpreting it, for reasons related to what the icj said. but that doesn't make us have to look beyond the reason for the president interpreting it the way he wants. i mean, do we have to defer to the icj, or do you  is it not sufficient to defer to the president, who is operating within his foreign-affairs power for whatever set of reasons he deems sufficient?
justice o'connor, the  vmi waived the only sovereign immunity that existed, which was the commonwealth of virginia's sovereign immunity. and, as a result  all of the agencies of the commonwealth of virginia served as unitary creditors  and so, when vmi waived the only sovereign immunity that existed, there was nothing left to waive. and, at that point, the recoveries of the estate  which were recoveries against other agencies, not only vmi  were  the respondent was permitted to bring those actions.
i beg your pardon?
well, what do you think about the  it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each of which try to get us out of this problem of the pressure, call it. and we have justice stevens' and then  but there were certain problems with justice souter's, which still i'm not certain might  then i had started with one that i guess the objection to it would be it's laughable. but  but is there  is there any  i mean, you see, it's  it's reading  it's reading the word right in 6 to encompass all of the paragraph in 8. is there anything  i mean, it's a pretty good objection that really that just goes too far.
i'm not 
okay? and  and the government argued there were 7 percent genuine issue ads really trying to exercise the constitutional right to petition government, because government is regulating us right now in terms of their votes and their actions. and, of course, that's why in the first amendment, it doesn't just say speech and  and association and press. it  it says 
a case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case. the notion  you used it derisively  the insurance policy. lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they? there's nothing wrong with doing that.
congress has made the judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal demise takes place before any delivery begins. that's official the big issue.
i'm trying to understand whether typically they're there for a long period of time on the one hand, or are they there sort of on probation and are periodically reviewed and moved into another system?
once 
isn't it your obligation to raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion for rehearing?
are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction  a hypothetical case, suppose the statute, federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case. would your argument be the same?
 difficult issue.
i don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the united states is bound by united states law. what  why isn't that extraterritorial application?
in gratz, the characteristics of individuals that could be considered were arguably relevant to a distribution decision. here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by relaxing other standards. the whole point is to achieve a value which comes from mixing the races, from distribution. and, therefore, why is it appropriate to look to other things as opposed to looking at that candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?
the only question is whether that alone is enough.
that's correct, that's correct. i would add also, with respect to the commission's determination about what is just and reasonable, it was not just a question of saying that a violation of the regulations is just and reasonable. the commission was charged here with the responsibility for adopting a compensation scheme that would provide for fair compensation for each pay phone operator for each and every call. and it spent a number of years and a number of different attempts working out what is a fair compensation. i would submit that all of that reasoning about what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why it's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the compensation. it's not just simply a question of an ipse dixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working out what the scheme should be, so it's fair. once it did that, it didn't require a lot of explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation that had been worked out over this period of time, a failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable.
justice ginsburg, it has some effects, but the  the critical point for this case is the power to reconsider is not eclipsed until the mandate issues. that's what this court held in forman v. united states, and we think it's what the advisory committee notes of rule 35 and 40 indicate.
was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through maples?
and what the statutes say is 
counsel, you  you say in your brief  i'm reading from page 13  that the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor groups and elected officials often determine the positions officials take. can you give me an example of an official who took a position because of the ties to donor groups?
yes.
i thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct  that there was an error in  of application.
i think that you would look at, one, whether the  the ad discusses a current legislative issue; two, whether or not it made any reference to the legislator beyond lobbying him or her about that specific issue. so there should not be any references to the election or the candidacy of the incumbent or any of those type references. and if you had that, you would have a bona fide, genuine effort to lobby. they are voting. they're taxing us. they're regulating us. and as we know, the record reflects that usually most of the  of these issues are decided in the context of this blackout period at the end of  end of congress. so i know it is difficult to balance these interests, but there is more interest among the people than simply the remote and speculative effort to influence an election. there is an immediate need to influence how government is regulating and taxing us. so that is the interest that is presented here. that is the interest that the court in mcconnell recognized when the court said there are genuine issue ads and  and only engage in what the government urged was a broadrick facial challenge analysis. the government said in mcconnell, well, any of these genuine issue ads can be dealt with in an as-applied challenge. now, they have switched sides here, having asked the court and the court engaging in a broadrick facial challenge analysis  are now saying that even though broadrick would allow as-applied, that you are not to entertain any as-applied. i just don't see 
no, your honor.
well, i  i think if  if the court allows to happen what  what happened here, then i think the message it could be saying to prosecutors, is as long as you can just rifle off a series of  of reasons for your strike and then the trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out of the context of the plausibility of all the other strikes, then we're going to allow this type of behavior to continue.
 then you are  you are  you are forced into federal court 
 if the defendant is found guilty, he would have been acquitted?
 that's why we have elections, in part.
they require the manufacturer, in order to sell the product, be registered with the state, and they can impose whatever sale restrictions they want 
no, i don't think so, justice scalia. the  the court in jackson transit specifically differentiated between congress assuming there was a contract cause of action whenever it calls for the creation of a contract and separately implying a cause of action. that's different because that  that has to  in doing that, the court has to create a cause of action in the first place, but congress is assumed to want contracts to be enforceable when it calls for the creation of the contracts in a federal statute.
what  what about if we go back to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger? you know, they only had one office, but they had depositors in different states, and this messenger went from state to state handing out the cash and collecting a fee. would congress at that time have considered that bank to be located in all the states where the messenger showed up?
 analysis?
i assure you, your honor, that denise finn doesn't.
 the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless-error inquiry?
your honor, collateral attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not normally sustained, if that's what the  if i understand your question correctly. so that, for example, in a diversity case, if two years or three years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody realizes that both parties were from the same state, the collateral attack would normally not allow to change that, to change that result. and i would think that the same thing would happen here. if the case had proceeded to final judgment, if there were an error of this type, as with other types of errors in subject matter jurisdiction, there would not be an opening for collateral attack.
yes, you may save your time.
well, take a look at the statute, justice ginsburg. please look at page 15a and 16a in the red brief. and if you look at section 621(b)  it's at the bottom of page 15a of the red brief  congress said what the purposes of the age discrimination act were, and it had three, but it's only addressed one through the prohibition. the second one was to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment. the other two were to promote employment of older persons based on ability and to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment. and if you turn the page and look at section 622(a)(1), the very first thing congress mandates that the secretary shall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake research and promote research with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons and the promotion of measures for using their skills. what the secretary of labor's report goes on at length about is it identifies all kinds of factors, neutral and non-neutral 
 the reason that people, i think, are saying that is because they have a lot of prisoners, they're trying to create a category of people who don't have to stay in prison, where they have no rights. and the real question is, can california, in trying to create this interim category, reduce the fourth amendment right in the way you describe?
well, that  yes, that's something different. but your statement, that there's just no first amendment interest 
then what is the  yes, but what's the justification for doing it? what is the practical problem that we are concerned with?
i mean, most  i don't think  a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial. and they may not like the person accused of murdering their son. that is not  that is sort of like in every case. that's not  the buttons don't seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench.
well, i 
mr. richland, you have 4 minutes remaining.
yes. that 
i mean, you're speaking as though somehow that  such a contract is contrary to public policy, and void.
well, can't you allege that the means by which it was done are unknown, but that it was by one or more of the following?
well, your honor, we  this is not the presidential primaries of which we're talking about.
yes, your honor. petitioner agreed that, he asked for that relief in the santos case.
what about the cell phone example?
the overt act is part of  it's our position that the overt act is required, and there needs to be an agreement 
you're sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal?
it  it doesn't, your honor.
but again 
well, the  the question is whether in that circumstance the  the bivens plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a first amendment right to be excused from prosecution or, after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil action, whether he has a right not to have been prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the existence of probable cause and the independent judgment by the prosecutor.
so  it's so counterintuitive. as the government points out, these holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.
it seems to me that you hold that  that the procedures here are adequate because  under the due process clause because in the broad range of cases, you're going to have sufficient notice and an opportunity to contest. again, i think it's really important to understand the nature of the decision issued here. it's really a gestalt judgment of prison officials exercising their expertise in an area that this court has repeatedly said prison officials get a wide range of deference. again, i would like to make a point about the federal bureau of prisons because the respondents have pointed to our control unit procedures which are more trial-like. and i just want to let the court know that those procedures were imposed upon the federal government and the bureau of prisons pursuant to a court order in 1978 before this court issued its decision in cases such as hewitt where the court made clear this distinction about prison placement and issues involving the judgment and predictive decisions of prison administrators. when the bureau of prisons has been 
perhaps. the  the whole thing about the warrant application, though, strikes me as  as a little bit more attenuated, though, also because it's done in advance of the police arriving on the scene and discovering what's going on whereas the police report 
i think the plaintiff would still bear the burden of showing that he is  he or she has been discriminated against 
and ultimately when the two clever parties got to the state supreme court, they would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if we granted cert this court would decide it, wouldn't it.
i don't necessarily disagree except that we're  the focus has to be on what the claim was that was raised in the state post-conviction proceeding; and 
but to the extent we're talking about duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the claims here do have a  success on the claims here would have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement. this court in muhammad said  i think this is probably the  the closest quote on point  challenges to particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the province of habeas corpus. this is a challenge to a particular, the parole procedures, that's affecting the duration of their confinement. or at least that's their allegations, and that's what success on their claims is going to mean. and because of those durational consequences, as well as because of the consequences of success on the merits for previous state parole decisions, we believe that those claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983. if there are no further questions.
it's just a  it's just a close textual reading of the eleventh amendment. right?
 if i 
that isn't the point. i think the point is, at least for  i think point is who is going to decide whether there was some justification here. and i read this memo. i thought that the da had a pretty good claim, that the police didn't do anything wrong. and there's also an argument they did. all right. so, who decides that kind of thing? a constitutional court or a state, under its protection laws or whistle-blower statutes?
does your  your case hinge upon your challenge to the dna evidence? in other words, if you don't have the suggestion that the dna evidence was manipulated, would you agree that in that case the third party guilt evidence could be kept out?
well, the  the finding is effective from that point forward. that has to be the case because, as justice scalia pointed out, it's important for the parties to know, as matters are unfolding, what the speedy trial clock is. that way the government knows to push the cases that are approaching the 70-day limit to trial. people can't know that answer if everyone is waiting to find out what the outcome of a pending motion is. and the defendant, in fact, couldn't move for dismissal under the act until the  the judge said after 1 or 2 years, i find the defendant incompetent.
that  that is true, but that, of course, was also true at common law for  for malicious prosecution.
and  and this is no different than that.
well, what about the pettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a long time?
was that because she applied 4 months late? if she had applied before the deadline in march, would you be here? would there be any issue?
ten to 20 years if you're caught, under this act, is my understanding. it depends on  the government 
it's a  it's a factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility and relevance of the third party guilt. they don't  you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.
well 
so i don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to  going to produce higher prices or not. the market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers.
well, your honor, in the alaska case  and here i refer the court to page 44 of the 1997 alaska case. there the court said that congress must, quote, explicitly recognize or that congress had explicitly recognized the resignation in that case. so the  the court 
i don't think it 
you didn't see that?
well, put in plain language what it is johnson is claiming he's entitled to. i don't understand.
is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting state law? suppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or something like that. and  and that would override all sorts of state law. you could specify you're entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would preempt state usury laws?
what kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? i mean, why  why do we do this?
it's  it's the silence at the  at the time it  it apparently departed from the practice of predecessor statutes that  that seems to be a problem for your argument.
it's not that complicated. all that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the army. and therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed  services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence. that's all, period. or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want. and by the way, district judge, if you disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because we think it's unreasonable. okay. what about that?
may i ask this question, mr. layton? this case kind of raises a question about the basic state interests that are involved here, and the state interests that justify the death penalty include deterrence and also retribution.
where do you, where do you come out on the 50-50 facility?
i'm rather clear it would not, isn't it? because that would be no more serious than the crime in garner, would it?
he was  he was convicted.
what's your answer? there are lots of these gambling boats that are parked 
who pays judgments against the county is initially probably the county, but under georgia law, the department of dot  department of transportation has a fund in which they can contribute towards that. and if you've looked in  and i think funding matters less here than  than the fact that these big projects are generally a collage of funding issues. you have state and federal money usually mixed in. so you're in a situation where, you know, if you went back 50 years ago and looked at funding, it might be very definitive. in these days and times, if you look at projects, you know, you got money coming from all sources, and if you start tracing the  the money, you can go in six different directions.
well, because his theory, justice souter, is the same with regard to both. he says this  the use of this 
you said that the prison grapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this particular lack of access to public materials. does the prison grapevine let them know that they're going to be in the cell for 23 hours a day and only be out 1 hour a day?
is  is the 
 our precedent, i think, isn't it?
i think it could be, your honor. and this court has said 
so  so it's never ground for reversal? i'm  i'm wondering, in line with justice scalia's question, is  is  would the calculus be, well, this is not a close case and some other cases are closer? i mean, is that what we do?
do you know how many claims in this case that  that were not in the delaware case?
i think that the eagles' disclaimer on there helps our case, but if it were not on there, i think the monument could still stand just as the creche did in lynch or the menorah in allegheny. the city of pawtucket was not endorsing the creche in the display, it was acknowledged as part of the overall holiday celebration.
well, we don't have any quarrel with the continuous workday rule. the question is, when does the workday begin? and our assessment of the workday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls, specifically, the walking time in this particular case, begins when you arrive at the actual place where you're going to perform the services 
really?
it could not have said, give the $75,000, or whatever it is, to the plan?
good guess.
thank you, mr. mancino. the case is submitted.
no, it 
we are not going to say we were not spies. we are going to 
twelve different, and one of them is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any provocation. right?
you mean with a specific earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales projections and demand?
but  but this case involves a lot more than convenience. it involves a substantial amount of assets that is either going to pass to one person under probate or is not going to be available for passing to that person because of the inter vivos gift. that seems to be more closely related to the core probate matters.
as  that's right. the right-of-way over the road of access, which they not only canceled in july of 1985 but refused to maintain themselves, so that he couldn't really access the ranch.
in some states, you  where the common law or the state statutes recognize these claims, all that we're arguing is that congress didn't focus on these. in the normal presumption against preemption, you don't, you know, cut through a wide swath of claims where congress hasn't expressed an intent specifically to preempt them. that's our position, and particularly where the congressional findings 
your honor, there is a disagreement in the opinion itself that 
well, wait. you  you pleaded  you pleaded that  that the defendant was  was an employer under the act. right?
that's right. and what happened 
well, if that's the case, then why  why would it be inappropriate to have further hearings in this case to see whether they're  they could be justified?
well, isn't  i mean, isn't that necessarily the case? if it's collecting all of its tax, then what it's complaining about is that it's getting less profit as the  as the retailer.
your honor, because mr. harris could have regained control of his vehicle. the point is that mister  that the petitioner had limited options based on the manner in which mr. harris was driving. even if this would be considered deadly force, we do believe it would be justified under the circumstances.
that would be a difficult argument to make, that it doesn't fall within the erroneously or illegally collected tax. but that was the same case in a.s. kreider. that was the same language in a.s. kreider, the erroneously collected tax. yet the court held that the more specific refund statute of limitations there applied.
even if its charter says something else.
 that you think would be acceptable?
could you tell us  as you know, aedpa has the decisions of settled precedents of the supreme court and there's the supreme court standard, a very general standard that we can get from darden and donnelly, although we didn't reverse there. i take it that the counsel for the respondent is going to say: well, this is a federal standard, but the eighth circuit is entitled to apply the specificity and the application that it's given to this, so the eighth circuit's entitled to rely on its cases in reversing. do you agree with that?
i think what disappears, your honor
that's right. that would mean that the district court did not on the merits ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the court said in mesa, the merits of the immunity defense have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of jurisdiction.
yes.
and then 
to cough up that easement. and in fact when he said, he offered to negotiate, and the immediate response from mr. vessels, who is since diseased, was, the united states does not negotiate. that wasn't just kind of starting of a bargaining position. they dug in and for a series of years the district court found, fully substantiated on the petition appellate via  appendix to the petition at page 37a, not only playing hardball and being selectively tough on him, but a number of clearly illegal acts, breaking into his lodge. one of them particularly striking to me at joint appendix 49 to 57, inciting a neighbor to ram a truck into the respondent while he was on horseback. firemen 
 a matter of law.
in  in contrast to that, however, you could not make that argument or  or that response with respect to  to district 24, the district in which the  the black vote was  was cracked. and in response to earlier questions from justice stevens, you  you mentioned there were a number of motivations for dividing it up the way it did, and  and yet, as you also acknowledge, those differing motivations don't answer a  a section 2 argument. what is your answer to the section 2 claim?
we're not questioning the authority. we're questioning whether congress intended that to be the case. we have a rule that  that requires a clear statement when it has effects of this sort.
probably not, certainly not where the state is  where the state offers as  as the proffered justification safety, it would not be enough. that would be a different justification for their actions. certainly where they're disturbing the neighbors, we would argue that the expectation of privacy had diminished in that home because of that disturbance. but again, where the state  or where the city is offering as a justification safety, that would not be sufficient to go in.
but i  i don't want to cut you off from your yellowtail argument, if  if you want to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in this case is that your ad is very much like a non- yellowtail ad. and the problem that we would have in accepting your argument is, number one, a problem of precedent and, number two, the problem that justice breyer raised that, again, we had dealt with in the prior case.
the  the important point, 25 justice kennedy, is the limitation provision at issue here 1 has to do with the finality of federal convictions. 2 congress was concerned that challenges to federal 3 convictions not be 
that's an added complication. there's another case on which the ninth circuit's based its decision in your case, deroche. your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in deroche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.
there are about  there are over 50, i think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act requirement. the  the argument you're making, i suppose, would require this court to go by  one by one through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests of every one because the absence of those words is not dispositive, as you see it. so you would be generating a controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that just wouldn't be there if you agreed with justice souter's approach.
we have a very different number.
but then what would be a lesser-included offense? because if it's not simple murder and it's not manslaughter, you haven't suggested a third that it might be. i thought your whole position was that this simple murder was right and the 
 but this  this is preliminary to my question. in swancc, we said there has to be a significant nexus. it seems to me that you have to show that there's some significant relation between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to regulate and the navigable water.
 for us to go into anything that wasn't raised in the original trial, that would have to be otherwise relevant.
no, you'd have to say, we don't want to spend any more and we also don't want to equalize pay. you have to say the second too.
because this court had not considered 
just go back to what you said. in  in the major  whatever it is  is there any limitation at all, or just the limitation on the qui tam and as here, as you contend is so here?
i thought she said she came to collect her belongings. that didn't sound like she's intending to stay very long.
no, that was added about 16 years later, your honor. and it was added, but it clarifies the scope of the statute. and, as this court admitted in  pointed out in cases like fausto and lafranca, the later amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and, indeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if they existed in their amended form from the offset.
i'm not sure i understand the answer. i  that  is it  does he  let me put it this way, and maybe you can answer yes or no.
well, in fact, in part that's correct, justice kennedy. the  the 
is there a classic case where the injunction should not be issued?
you know sometimes, sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they  that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.
no, justice ginsburg, i don't believe that is true because this is not this taxpayer's homestead. he no longer lives at this address. he, as his  as his argument, spends a great deal of time explaining 
so, i mean, that proves too much because they  the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity. the immunity from suit is  is clearly 
reasonably, the person realizes he would be outvoted?
by terms of our 
that's correct, your honor.
in matlock 
mr. mccartan, how does  how does your standard work? the same question i asked mr. kneedler. the  the test you would propose is whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution would have been brought anyway?
yes. signs, placards.
yes.
mr. harris was simply a  an unsafe driver. there is always a risk at driving in excess of speed limit, driving in violation of traffic laws. but that risk in and of itself is not 
what  what about the  the example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if you're self-insured?
well, that  that question actually was litigated in this case, the first time in 2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the new map. one of the arguments that was presented to the district court was that the old map was no longer consistent with how texas voters were voting. and the district court concluded that under the upham case, it lacked the authority to take that into account and to change the demonstrated policy preferences of the last legislative map. and that's why, on remand in this case, the district court found although it didn't intend to work partisan bias, that that was the effect of its map.
may i ask this question, general?
"it doesn't excuse, in any way," your honor. and we  as a matter 
i think segura is contrary to that.
 the equipment is only good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to get new ones. they have to walk back to the place 
 the point of contractability?
thank you, counsel. mr. multhaup.
what is the  the methodology that you think we should follow in determining where the burden should be allocated under any particular criminal statute? is it the  the majority rule at the time when that particular statute was enacted or at  is it  you don't think it's the  the old common law rule. what  what is the  at what point of time do we look at the  at what's going on throughout our country?
it was her will to yield to the will of someone else. i mean, you can't blame somebody else for her making the choice.
but you just  that's a bit inconsistent with your point that newlon is distinguishable because there were no objections at all and that was the reason for the court saying this goes too far to the prosecutor. but now you say when there are objections 
would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not?
 that this was the common law when the due process clause was adopted. davis took the position that the common law had evolved to the point where on the specific defense of insanity, that this was the result that should follow, that there should be a burden of production on the defendant, and then the government should have to disprove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. but davis was not a constitutional holding.
i mean, if you had a case where you didn't dispute that the issue was jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the pendant state law claims, we'd still have to throw that out. right?
it's pretty hard to see an argument against it.
yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief  and correct me if i've got you wrong  you don't like what the third circuit did. you say just the fact of the conviction counts. don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair system that comports with fundamental notions of due process. just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the world. and so what  what you're telling me is that it doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he were precluded from appealing for some reason that we would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your view of this statute.
even if we agree with you on the incompetency exclusion, we still have to reach the waiver for all time question. correct? you don't argue that the incompetency goes back that far, do you?
how would you handle that case?
no, your honor.
well, the jury could certainly find he's creating a risk. but with regard to the other garner factors that must be shown before deadly force can be used, he had not committed a violent felony, a crime involving the infliction or threat of infliction 
yes.
 damage remedies available under the rehabilitation act is 
right, and those should be circumstances where the state court is left to judge whether the claim has merit while the federal court proceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance. it makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this court, to let the state courts pass judgment first on claims that have sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of under rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.
why isn't that a reasonable factor other than age?
 and to respond that there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that, congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't  it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders.
it isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. it's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.
are 
 as a constitutional matter.
no.
 the text, on pages 23a and 24a, gives the impression that the district court is disposing of the entire case.
no, i 
i thought that there were  well, never mind.
i believe, yes, under, under the test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes, this would not be deadly force. of course, what we're saying is 
 "in equipoise"?
i think there are two answers to 20 that question. first is that counsel was, in fact, 21 looking at the testimony that would be read at  during 22 the aggravation and sentencing case to determine how to 23 challenge that, how best to challenge that. and second, the assumption of the question is 25 that the court records were somehow superior to the 1 sources that counsel actually looked to. and i don't 2 think on the record of this case, that's objectively true. 3 counsel is  has  has hired three independent experts, 4 all of whom are specifically trained 
perhaps not if that was the only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because, as i indicated before, as justice stevens stressed in his concurring opinion in brecht, the kotteakos standard is a demanding standard. and look at this case. if the error in this case can be deemed harmless under any standard, then what cannot? what is prejudice when you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that mr. fry was not guilty. they told the judge that they were at an impasse. this jury struggled mightily with this evidence.
yes, sir.
i don't believe so, your honor, because if the court  if the rule says that the rule 50(a) motion can be granted; conversely, it can be denied. if it can be granted or denied, those decisions are appealable under section 2106, which is the general provision that orders of the court can be appealed. i do not see anything in rule 50 that says that denial of the 50(a) motion is not appealable. what rule 50(b) does is 
justice breyer, the problem is  and  and justice souter, you referenced this. there have been many references to this, that 60(b) is not a problem. it's already cabined out there. in fact, it's not. it's abuse of discretion review in courts of appeals. we cite a case, hamilton v. newland, from the ninth circuit where they used 60(b)(6). the  the petitioner filed his claims. they were clearly barred by the statute of limitations, not an artuz problem. so he said, all right, i'm going back to federal court with a 60(b)(6) claim. i'm actually innocent. that puts me in 60(b)(6). i admit actual innocence. it's  it's a very weak claim. i can't been get relief on it. but the district court said, come on in. i'm going to decide your claims.
guilty.
 but i think that that's 
i think your answer would be that how could it possibly be reasonable except for the consideration of some additional fact? what makes it reasonable other than facts? atmosphere? i mean 
well, i think more broadly, justice kennedy, that one reason that states do have discretion in this area  and i think that florida is not unusual in that regard  is that prison officials are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution and to take into account changes that might suggest that a particular method is problematic. and so whether or not there is a constitutional obligation, i think that there is every reason to think that states will, in fact, do that. i think that it is noteworthy 
overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case. so get in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.
why not?
 "we think you owe this."
no, the 
how about your client's supplier? if your client  if ideal is selling less, then it's going to buy less from its supplier. so would the supplier also have a rico claim?
i don't understand what it is that hasn't worked.
a corporation was not a citizen of  of its principal place of business, only of its state of incorporation. so there would have been total parity in 1882, 1887, 1911, 1948.
no, your honor. under monroe before this court, i think the court was looking to the potential, the possibility, of course. and as to the fact pattern we had at the trial court, it was a very minor party wanting to  or effectively poach voters from the two major parties. but you have to look at the entire statutory scheme and not just how it would apply. it could be applied by the democrats or the republicans. but also more importantly, in monroe this court clearly stated that a state does not have to wait until it sees actual damage to its political or electoral system to make reasonable decisions. in fact, this court says the states should have the foresight to make those reasonable determinations in an effort to prevent those  those potential evils from occurring if the likelihood of  of that is there. and the district court made very 
it doesn't seem to be the case. in fact  and our research has revealed that about 60 ineffective assistance claims based on the vienna convention violations  it's ambiguous as to whether there's one or none where the court has granted relief either on prejudice grounds or performance grounds. so litigants have tried, but that just shows what a poor fit ineffective assistance claims are.
yes. the district court denied that.
 that they must do that, because, as this court recognized in pliler versus ford, it's almost never apparent on the face of the petition 
mr. waxman, can i ask you this, just about guam, not about the other territories. is there anything in the organic act that would prevent guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35 percent to 100 or 150?
no. the  the  the congress has waived the sovereign immunity from those types of claims under the federal tort claims act.
 "yes, we are the responsible party."
mr. miller, you have about 4 minutes left.
but i think it does further the purpose of what congress was looking to in both the virgin islands and alaska. the requirement for various reasons that they impose their tax on the actual value certainly supports the reasonableness of the interpretation here, your honor.
yes.
no. i'm not sure what the word established means. that would be different. as the court said in bougas, it wasn't going there, and i don't know that we need to go there today. established 
he'd be able to make the same argument.
well, on that theory, then, there was  there was no time issue with respect to the right to offset, then, in the olc's position.
justice ginsburg, there are a number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent this alleged conduct and that he did invoke. we don't think that there is a remedy under bivens or an inferred action under the just compensation clause.
yes, sir. and  and there again, i'd like for the court to  to understand my statement that we should construe this on what  how the federal law  how you  how the federal courts construe it, not use mississippi's lesser standard, but let's  let's construe it on whether or not, first, it is a true lesser-included offense because that's  that's what the federal standard is, and that's what we followed in nebraska. and secondly, if it's a true lesser-included offense, we have to use the analysis of the federal courts which says that it has to use the strict elements test. well, murder would not be a lesser-included offense under federal law because under the mississippi capital murder statute can be with or without deliberate design. therefore, there is no deliberate design. it would not be a lesser-included offense of murder. manslaughter would not be a lesser-included offense under that same elements test because it requires the additional element of sudden provocation or heat of passion. so i would submit to the court, if we apply what's fair under federal law, what the floor is under federal law, we should use the federal analysis and not mississippi 
that would be my point, justice souter, but i also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat different municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started the wishing well and added the creche. i don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules could be the same.
so, we have to agree with you, though, that our treaty partners in this area have, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the treaty.
well, i would start with the reality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this court recognized in both place and edmond, are very unique both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is conducted, as well as the content of  of the information that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going to be able to reveal the presence or absence of contraband. and this court has recognized that individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of contraband.
we anticipated that comment actually. (laughter.)
they knew that minors 
you mean on  on  in every  in every case then, i mean, congress would have to  i'm sorry  a scientist would have to analyze the molecules and  and trace them up, and so long as they could  could trace it to a specific discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they couldn't? i mean, that  you know, you know what i'm getting at. that obviously would  would totally thwart the regulation.
but if you disagreed with that, you could appeal it up again. right? you can go to the court of appeals 
and perhaps there are people, lawyers in the government, who try to see through that kind of thing.
and therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the osc is not open to them.
could you get us  we're going to have supplemental material filed, the olc opinion. could you  could you get us a  you know, a sample of an agency letter? or, if you can't, maybe the government can?
no, your honor.
well, justice breyer, let me take as a point of departure the specific risks that you associated with the injection that induces fetal demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to that injection, then all the other benefits that are associated with the d&x procedure don't matter because they can perform the d&x procedure. now if you look through the record on this point, i think you will not find any testimony that supports a significant risk from that injection. yes, there are risks because there are risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not significant.
can you tell me, do you agree that a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?
your honor, i would be most pleased to argue that there is no liberty interest in this instance under sandin. the court made it very clear that where there is a mandatory state-created interest, that interest would have to involve a significant and atypical deprivation. in this instance, we do not believe that moving an inmate to level 5 classification is a significant or atypical deprivation.
let me clarify one thing. what  it would be  this relates only to the control unit, which is now at  at  in  in part of the adx florence facility. it does not apply to the general populations of the adx florence facility and the marion facility.
 a fraud 
but  on appellate review in california, they found it cumulative, didn't they?
that was the effect of such discrimination, yes.
a statute could do that. a statute could do that. but this statute requires that it be a water of the united states.
absolutely, your honor. the credit is available independent of whether you already have a presence in ohio, whether you've never had a presence in ohio, whether you've never even paid taxes in ohio before. certainly, if you invested within the state, you're now going to have a corporate franchise tax bill, and the credit would be useful to you at that point. but you could have had no pre-existing relationship with the state at all, as a taxpayer, and still take advantage of this tax credit. it's equally available to all comers. the only question is, what do you do in the state of ohio? do you invest money in the state of ohio? and the credit turns on the amount of that activity in ohio. if daimlerchrysler establishes a new plant in missouri or montana or california, it, in no way, impacts the credit that they receive in ohio. they're not deprived of that credit. it doesn't become of a  of a lower value because of their decision to invest elsewhere. and so, under this court's 
fine. in 
attempt is not a lesser included. the congress has intended to make attempt on the same level as the substantive offense. that is the way the case law has been coming out. so whether he official enters, whether he attempts, or whether he's found in the united states are all on an equal par. it's not a lesser included.
justice scalia, i  i would disagree with  with the court's analysis there. i  i think what  what the issue here is more whether, given the testimony of dr. blake, given the corroborating evidence that supports dr. blake's testimony, would a reasonable juror have doubts or would any reasonable juror have a  retain a reasonable  excuse me 
but we're talking  in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. we are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.
excuse me?
yes.
justice stevens, i would. first, i think that the state can search for a better address by mail.
but do you agree that they set out different causation standards, 12 and 13?
well, you  i mean, you say that, but how? the very activity that you don't want them to engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries are engaging in, for example.
well, whatever the reason he gave, was it  these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these  were those opinions already out there?
no, neither am i.
did  did the florida make a mistake of what 
in the most complex frauds, a  a company is reporting revenue and earnings and their stock is, let's say, trading at $60 a share. perhaps, because of fraud, it's overstated by $30. there are people in the market buying that stock at $60. that company starts to lower those expectations. this happens to be a real world example, worldcom. they say we're going to miss revenues by $172 million. the stock starts dropping down. the inflation that was in that stock because of what they lied about starts coming out. nobody knows there's fraud. nobody understands that. in fact, it's not until that stock goes down at 80 cents that there was an admission of fraud.
no. the tax rate will be changed to be lower to maintain the same level, so there would be no  because the legislature isn't acting to address any tax liability. they're simply asking to manipulate the debt limitation, which is very contrary to the purpose and any meaningful message that debt limitation 
well, once you 
not that i'm aware of, but what the city of waco case says, upon which they base their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal of that particular order was because it would be held preclusive. here, it would not be held preclusive because there is no right of appellate review.
and what is the law of the prison grievance proceeding on that point?
i mean, in  particularly based on the csrt hearing?
no, but he could have made  i'm saying he could have said to the lawyer, i'll pay you 30  a  a third of the recovery or i'll pay you $100 an hour.
so you're  you're saying there  there's a separate value here, and that is the value of access to courts. and  and that limits what can be done for purposes of behavior modification.
so are these noninherent federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for federal functions? so there's inherent federal functions and noninherent?
what justification is there for that? i mean, for two stages through the prison administrative process, y has been identified. the prison has taken action on the merits on the assumption that y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible party. what reason is there in a federal court to say that the exhaustion is incomplete because he didn't mention y back at stage one?
i take it you then agree that the answer for which you argue here follows not merely from the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a continuous  some variety of a continuous workday rule.
here's  here's the difficulty that i  that i have. when i read your brief, i thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody. it's really about custody. they want to get out eventually. but then when i  i  when i went back to balisok, i thought, oh, here's the problem. the problem is that it's a damage remedy in balisok. and normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. but he's going to get mixed up. when do you send him to habeas? well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought. and so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of fourth amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't got to habeas. don't go to habeas. you didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had  unless it was necessary to upset the conviction. you see? that's why that language is there. now, i got that far. then i said, oh, i see what you do. we should have one rule for damages. well, that makes sense. but there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule. but the next thing i come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action. and i said, well, why did we write that? you know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble. but the  the  well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and  and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera. okay. so once i got that far, i said, oh, well, i'm going to have to change something for you to win. either i have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or i have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary. i don't want to change the word necessary. maybe i could change the other, but why bother really? because all that's important here is people know which way they should go. now, that's where i am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action. it's simpler. it follows from balisok. why not?
this court's test in swancc is based upon the before, and also based upon riverside, it examined the before condition and the impact on that navigable water. and what is to be prevented is the discharge into that navigable water. and that is the initial test that is conducted. if the court examines the respondent's actual test data, what they examined here was the jurisdictional determination from the beginning. is there a connection? is it isolated? is it not isolated? they didn't look at the after-effect. they looked at the after-effect in relationship to issuing or not issuing the permit.
i have several responses to that. that sort of approach, putting to the test basically a congregation-by-congregation  or denomination-by-denomination, to use familiar terms  test about whether a  an exception should be recognized for a particular religion, itself, presents difficult questions. if you  if you have a particular religious sect that believes that it is  that it is important to invite everyone to the table  not simply a closed group that has gone through screening, but a  but everyone to their table 
may i ask you this question about what you think we should do. if i thought the evidence did support the conclusion that it's never medically necessary, it merely  the evidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor has to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather than the other because there are more risks involved in one procedure rather than the other, would that be sufficient to support the  i can see the argument that the intact delivery may have less risk of complications and so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely official necessary.
justice scalia, first of all, there is evidence that the hue and cry practice existed. there is not evidence about how hue and cry reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law. it is very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century english practice what we are dealing with now, in part because the system of public prosecutions that we have today where an official prosecutor representing the state carries the ball in a criminal case did not exist. the accuser had to appear in court as the private prosecutor. if the accuser did not appear, there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were simply dismissed because there was no one official on the scene to carry the ball. so the  the speculation that's required requires a number of inferential leaps that petitioners have to make in order to draw an analogy. and at the same time, there really is an intuitive difference between the kinds of statements that people make in emergencies and the kind of core testimonial statements that we know prompted the confrontation right, the sir walter raleigh case involving affidavits and letters, the marian practice under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually ongoing.
thank you, ms. blatt. mr. chemerinsky.
that's correct, your honor, but, again, endorsement is also not an element of compelled-speech claim. but let me  let me bring those two questions together on a factual point. the law schools are disseminating a message that they believe it is immoral to abet discrimination. when 
no, your honor.
if construed as petitioners would have it, yes.
that's 
 whatever power it was under, it's a demonstration that you can make an exception without the sky falling.
sure. and as i tried to indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern because, the difference is whether some clinics will only offer the d&x and the d&e and will say that basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the induction procedure. but that doesn't really, i don't think matter, because the point is anybody could can got a d&x who is at a clinic can also get a d&e. in every single case the doctor that can perform the d&x can also offer the d&e. and since the d&e is what the district court in the nebraska case described as the gold standard of casey, i think every woman in every case is going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy option. and again one way to illustrate that is chasen.
the latter is more accurate. i'm 3  i'm  i was trying not to overreach, but i went with 4 the cases that states that were clear that laches would 5 apply either by statute or by case law. and why this becomes particularly important to 7 me is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the 8 ends of the federal court overall, especially when you're 9 talking about finality because it seems to be the tail 10 wagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off 11 the possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few 12 cases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions 13 to be filed and managed. and it has been pointed, you 14 know, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about 15 roughly 260 days. it's a burden on the court that's 16 unnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think 17 that in light of custis and daniels, the plain language 18 takes us all the way there.
your honor, i believe in this case there would be probable cause for an officer to believe it was and therefore effect an arrest. i don't believe that the  the question has been answered in washington, and i believe there are good grounds to argue that it would be permissible and that, indeed, unlike the decision in state v. flora, there were distinguishing circumstances here, including the absence of passers-by on the scene.
can i 
 congressional statute.
so he wouldn't  he wouldn't qualify for the 
well, i didn't 
there may be instances where the employee would not know that they could take advantage of that provision. but in the bay area laundry case, the court considered and rejected a virtually identical argument. that case  the statute of limitations also was stated in the alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the information necessary to the claim had arrived. and the party who was opposed to the position the court ultimately adopted said that the court's interpretation of the first of the two alternatives would render the second superfluous. and the court said, it may be superfluous to this category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other categories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from construing the first provision in the way that we are. so likewise, even if the court were to conclude that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or unavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals have held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator. a couple of justices, justice souter 
is it reasonable for a state court to say that three family members sitting in a courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of days the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so and so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that it should, and may consider in deciding guilt or innocence?
well, this  i'm  i'm relying strictly on the statutory language in making this argument.
 to the 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
the 
why  why doesn't the  the prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've done it, it sticks? why  why doesn't the prosecution have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule? everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are going to be careful.
well 
but that's stumpf's case.
there were two cases cited as involving the same prosecutor? was it shurn also?
every time they sue on the  on the ground that  let's say, that  that the  the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product. so it's not a  a question of needing more fact. on your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else. that impeaches the label. therefore, preemption.
but this was the current  this is 10 the current federal practice. i think attorney charles 11 testifies at length that the prevailing practice in 1988 12 in pennsylvania was not to get records, that it was, as 13 the aba guidelines and even the goodpaster article 14 suggests, to first sit down with your client, have an 15 extensive conversation with your client, get a 16 relationship of trust, talk to family members, talk to 17 friends, get experts, and then get a game plan together 18 about what records to go to. and in this case 
now 
 would accomplish your objective if you just struck the whole clause after the word if. you don't really need that.
 i must say, i don't quite follow the  why couldn't they simply say it's untimely? wouldn't that  that it  there was  it was not pending during this period, because it  3 years elapsed, and that's unreasonable. wouldn't that end the case?
well, i think what your honor is really asking is, if the plaintiff in this case had taken his disposition memorandum, and, rather than give it to his supervisor, which what he  what he was required to do, he went to the public and gave it to them on a pending case, i don't necessarily think that would be protected under pickering, as well.
 function, everybody else comes 
but, your honor, there would be no need to charge a separate offense. if you look at 1951(b) 
i don't know why you're so  i thought that the literature was replete with law review articles saying that this is the best strategy. trial judges have told us this is the best strategy. i  i don't quite understand your hesitation unless it's to build in this  this factor of consent.
but your hypothetical, your honor, presupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a possessory right subject to lease. the possessory right here did not exist because the oneida indian nation had no rights with respect to the land at all in 1997. those rights could not be enforced. and for the right not to be 
if we're trying to figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent? in other words, congress passed these provisions providing for treble damages for attorneys' fees. and 
briefly.
so that if an employer decides to  because his employees have had a good year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for them  he  his plan is to have a contract with a paving company to pave the parking lot. are the payments under that contract's contributions to an employee benefit plan?
which question?
well, are you claiming that  are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to the question of waiver? in other words, when  that the attorney should have insisted that the judge go through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with him about waiver and inform him of certain things about what he was giving up? are you making that claim?
well, because it's an absurd hypothetical. what is the 
but there's nothing unusual 
they come  then, if it please your honor, that after i pointed out that the restraint is directly on price, which should be a red flag to anyone, and also that i pointed out that there is no reasonable relationship between the pricing and the cost, the savings, for the joint venture, the last issue on that is whether there's any justification. and what justification is there? there's none.
well, i just said that they may not be covered, but they 
 understand that that's 
there was no procedure here, your honor, and that's the point of our lawsuit is that the fact that castle rock has an official custom and policy of ignoring, of not applying any procedure to these types of claims is the crux of our complaint in this case.
i would have had no objection.
i'd agree.
but that would be 
i think murray 
i mean, that's the problem. we've got to go through each one of them one by one.
doesn't an indictment have as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime he's being accused of committing? isn't that  so that's why i thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't it, or helpful to say that to the ninth circuit? and so an error is when it doesn't do that? and an error is when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what crime is being committed, he's accused of. so suppose you had an indictment that really did that. now he doesn't know what crime he's accused of. and then you go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into at what point did he work out what crime he was being accused of, rather hard to say.
if that's so, congress shouldn't have copied the language of title vii. it isn't a matter of it just accidentally comes out to  to be sounding the same, as though, you know, two monkeys did it on a typewriter or something. they copied  they copied title vii.
i'm vaguely recalling cases from the court of appeals in the d.c. circuit that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs around, there are likely to be firearms around. are you saying that that's inconsistent with the richards decision?
not anytime, justice kennedy. i think that would effectively overturn this court's holding in flanagan, that there's no right of taking a collateral order appeal in every single case involving the disqualification of counsel. but what's critical here, i think, is to compare the position of a defendant who has no counsel at all, the position of a defendant who has counsel who's laboring under a conflict of interest, the position of a defendant who has a counsel who's not performing competently, who's making professionally unreasonable decisions. only in the first of those instances has this court held that automatic reversal without any showing of prejudice at all is warranted.
i'm sorry, your honor?
well, that's unfair to the federal circuit on two points. number one, it was very clear to the federal circuit, and in fact i think they said that, i can't put my hand on the page, where they said, there is no issue here about step number one. all that people are fighting about is the correlating step and what it means. and the problem that labcorp had in the federal circuit with respect to the correlating step, which is a question they tried to bring up and was cert denied, is that they proposed in the district court the definition that was used by the federal circuit, which is a mutual or reciprocal relationship between an elevated level and the vitamin. and so having proposed that, it actually makes sense as a diagnostic test, as the federal circuit pointed out with the example of the pregnancy test. now, justice scalia, you asked a question earlier 
i inferred that from your comments.
and he talked to all of them 22 and talked to the defendant as well. so would a 23 reasonable person think that's enough to find out family 24 history and  and the concerns that you had?
yes.
then what's its gripe? it wants a bigger profit? it wants to increase 
 under 1101 
well, i don't think we could say they didn't care because there were, as part of the joint venture agreement, brand management protocols to preserve the equality of the brands. but that was the only limitation, and that's a limitation that could be challenged. don't misunderstand our position in this case. that was part of the agreement to create the joint venture. that is subject to section 1 of the sherman act, but it's challengeable on a rule of reason inquiry because this is an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.
so what was the basis for your opposition to cert?
but, mr. phillips, it says it  either something is before, preliminary; or after, postliminary. and if it's neither of those, then, it seems to me, it fits  it's not before the principal activity, and it's not after the principal activity, so what else is it, other than the 
what do you think about the approach  because i have had some of these cases. and i see  i think words, words, words. and what congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for some other words. so therefore, take strong inference. the most helpful thing is take it, look at the complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong inference. or maybe we'd say it isn't. we read it, and avoid all the other issues. what do you think about that?
in any event, they were attacking the same thing. so, your case is different, at least to that extent, that you have two discrete taxes.
is it permissible for a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and ethnicity in account  into account in drawing a district?
but you  you  i thought there was a reg of the ins.
your honor, that would be equally true of an assignment of a stock dividend while i retain the stock. i may not know what the dividend payment is going to be, but if i control the underlying source of income, i.e., the stock, then the transfer to someone else of the dividend doesn't alter the incident of tax, even if it's unknown. and i would point out that in lucas v. earl, the husband and wife in that case entered into agreement to assign to each other 50 percent of their income in 1901, long before the income tax was even instituted, and the tax years at issue in that case were 1920 and 1921. if anything, it was much more speculative and uncertain what income would have been earned 20 years later in that case, and that did not stop the court from 
 have been 
mr. nager, you have 2 minutes remaining.
i  i misspoke. okay.
oh, but they're  they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior. they are using it as a basis for thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, there were people meeting in a room and saying things to each other. so they are not just saying that it's sufficient. they are saying it's evidence that something else occurred.
i'm sorry?
well, they  they wouldn't have to prove how it came out. they would just have to prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the market learned the truth. i mean, if it was published in a  in a column by some market reporter who doesn't disclose how he found out. so long as the market knows the truth, isn't that all they need?
has anyone ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?
reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. in every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say i want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong. but isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object? and the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms. increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not. and your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?
no, but let 
what about 
well, with respect to certain aspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes. for example, whether a preliminary injunction should  is the proper remedy if all the other criteria are satisfied.
except for the fact, your honor, i mean, the  the situation we have is that is  it would depend on whether it's an ongoing situation or not. and in the facts presented here, it was not an ongoing situation. it ended and then the officer 
no, i don't think so, your honor. if you're referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties, we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority. but we certainly think there's nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction that's been adopted here. in fact, we think it is the most consistent with that language. the language of 5523 upon which respondent relies does not change that conclusion. while if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer, it should be not  it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the department's 2005 advisory memorandum. the department's construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under our and seminole rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than respondent's reading of 553 does.
well, ms. percival, would you still be here today with this argument if the defendant had simply had shackles around his ankles that would have prevented him, in  in effect, from running or lunging at anyone, but that that had been concealed by appropriate covers around the table where he was sitting so that the jury was unaware of that situation?
i would say it is unusual, but it happens where  and i think the trial judge certainly in this case who believes that if she's mistaken, can  can correct her ruling and send it to the jury, then feels somewhat free to  to do what the defendant asks, if it seems reasonable, and  and knows that if  if it can be corrected 
but  excuse me  how could olc possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? i mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings. i mean, that's the point. whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the justice department was that this statute official relates to administrative proceedings.
what's the problem with  there should be a problem with what i say from your point of view, so 
and it was denied.
no. i'm asking you for a  i'd have to write  if i agreed with you, i'd have to say we have here a judge who changed his mind. under the clause of the constitution, a judge cannot change his mind when. now, go ahead. now, fill in the blanks.
thank you, mr. stearns. mr. ayer, we'll hear from you.
but the reasonableness here would be unreasonable, unless there are some checks. we're talking about suspicionless searches. and you could have checks. but what about saying  why is it reasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on the behavior of the police? that's the question.
entirely meaningless.
 by not allowing them to come on campus.
but you don't need an amendment, i don't think. if you're talking about a transaction, the question is, what is the transaction? and in habeas it may be quite different than in other civil things.
but are these going to be difficult cases under pickering balancing? you have the case like this, where the employee, let's say, says to the prosecutor, "i think the case should be dismissed." the prosecutor says, "well, i'm the supervisor, and i disagree. we're not going to dismiss the case." typically, the employee wouldn't be disciplined for doing something like that. now, if the employee persists and, you know, is insubordinate, there would be another basis for taking disciplinary action.
justice ginsburg, i believe that this court has answered your honor's question in the blue chip stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort of an approach, and the one that was consistent with the court below. what the court, in blue chip stamp  which, of course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's claim was a class action  what this court said, for purposes of a civil proceeding, is, "purchase or seller requirement nowhere appears in the statutory language." the statute clearly says "in connection with the purchase or sale of securities." but, as a statutory matter, this court concluded, your honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5) had been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude that the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of private cause of action. so, we understand  we believe, your honor, that it  and it is undisputed on this record  that all parties agree, as the court below concluded, that this  congress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a statutory matter into slusa. we also think, justice ginsburg, that, were your honors to conclude that somehow "in connection with" means something different in a civil context, a narrower reading than in the broader context, that would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of lenity that is applied by this court. it would also mark what we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have been able to determine  and respondent cites no authority to the contrary  in which the same provisions in a statute that have civil and criminal 
so what is your  what rule would you have here? the question is, was he convicted of a crime of violence? 98 percent of the cases, all you have to do is look to the crime charged, burglary, and the fact that he was convicted. he pleaded guilty or didn't. but there are these two  three states i guess that lump together in one code provision for breaking and entering into a ship or a car or a house. so now we've got to know which of the three it is. if they go to trial, it's easy. just look to the jury instructions. if they plead guilty, i guess your opponents would say that's the end of it. you can't use it because we don't ever know from the charge itself which of the three it was that was at issue. was a house at issue? was a car at issue? was a boat at issue? now, you're going to say, but do a little investigating to find out what was at issue. look at the police report. is your view look at anything as long as it's uncontested and clear? their argument is no matter what you look into, once you go beyond that charging document, you're going to find i think justice souter's point. it's going to be ambiguous sometimes. you get into facts of things happened years ago. it's just not worth it.
well, the penalty phase. i mean 
could the police just issue an order saying ignore all orders of this kind?
 under the second circuit's test, because 
justice breyer, i have two responses to that. the first is i think the  that the totten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow confines of the contract.
i hope that's not a criticism of the writing.
the court always has discretion not to decide 
but 
but you didn't object to the charge that was given on negligence. you didn't object to the in whole or in part. so that should be out of the official case.
and now, let us also assume a state of the law. the state of the law is that there is no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a condition in a contract. all right? now, on those two assumptions, the next thing that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid. on those assumptions, is there a case or controversy under the federal constitution? if not, why not?
absolutely, justice scalia. i agree.
you can't challenge in the d.c. circuit the administrator's interpretation official that led to the enforcement action?
okay, we've got one difference from bacchus, because the claim that's being made here, which i gather was not made, or made seriously, in bacchus, is there really is a need for differential treatment for purposes of enforcement. go back to the enforcement of the tax law.
who mandated this plan? the state of new york?
you don't deny that a state  that michigan could bar all out-of-state wine  not just  not just california, but they could bar all out-of-state wines?
perhaps the best way to do this is to give a example. suppose that the shoe were on the other foot. suppose that judge jackson had looked at this defendant and said, you know, this defendant did not learn from his experience. he was given leniency in the state court. he didn't take advantage of that opportunity. his statutory maximum is 20 years and i'm going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, i'm going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence. i submit that in that circumstances the petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this deviation is unreasonable. and i have no problem with a petitioner making that argument if that's what happens to his or her client. my problem is that without that kind of anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work with.
if i could answer the question, i think that the fact that you point to the specific language of swann is helpful, because the court there in dictum  i think everybody would agrees that was dictum  said that you could achieve a prescribed ratio. and that's exactly where the logic of the other side, of the ninth circuit, of judge boudin, with all respect, that's where it takes you. and i think anybody that relied on that language in the wake of cases like crosson, in the wake of freeman against pitts, that said achieving a racial balance for its own sake is not constitutional, and bakke and grutter against gratz, that all said that racial balancing is verboten, i think those school districts would have been misguided in relying on that language. thank you.
that's what i thought your 
your honor, i would submit to you, justice scalia, that that wasn't required. what we needed to prove 
they were not allowed to go home. they were required, they were required 
well, i think if we were entitled to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for and we should have properly received a proximate cause instruction. and that's what  that's the question that will be at issue on the remand.
 an open 
there was no avoidance motive in the 
 because you weren't intention  your 
i don't think the congress has enacted the  the model penal code. this  this court sometimes looks to the model penal code as one source of what is  of  of thought out there, but that's all.
but why? isn't the reason just a  just a question of crafting an appropriate remedy for  an appropriate deterrence 
i don't know the answer to that, justice 
you think it satisfies due process just to show you the report, and then 
this case certainly is.
right.
yes.
 a very strange argument.
but  but you 
 et cetera.
what?
but 
your honor, it's just typically what occurs, and so there are some circumstances where a level 3 inmate may be moved to 5, but in any event, that inmate would have been moved to 4. the classification jump is, in a practical standpoint 
but that certainly doesn't include the right to present any evidence you want.
that's correct. that wouldn't be this particular 
well, no.
surely. although the terms of the icj decision purport to apply more broadly than to these 51, and they explicitly say that this cannot be taken to imply that this does not apply to other foreign nationals, notwithstanding its jurisdictional statute that prevents it from doing that.
i'm rather surprised at your answers because i was thinking you want to draw a rather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and only fraud. proximate cause, case a, the fraud does nothing but lowers the cost of the firm; case b, the fraud is something that directly is aimed to raise the cost of a particular specified competitor. i see a clear difference between those two cases, but you apparently don't.
yes. they searched that room. so the room was searched before they went there. they searched all the rooms. they searched ms. mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. and  and the testimony  and this goes to justice souter's question.
thank you, counsel. ms. millett?
there was no agreement with the respondent and the tortfeasor about allocation whatsoever. the idea that we unilaterally came up with a number is  is not correct. it was a lump sum amount, and when the state  the petitioner and respondents couldn't reach an agreement, ultimately, in order to obviate the necessity for putting on evidence of damages before the district court, so the court would have a factual basis to make this allocation, we entered into a stipulation. and that's where we got to the number that we got to.
counsel 
yes, that's correct.
 modify justice ginsburg's question a little bit. supposing, over a period of years, one dealer always got 15 percent off, and the other one always got 20 percent, and there's testimony they're in the same relevant market, so presumably customers can go to either one. what more do they have to prove to establish a prima facie case?
in other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as  as you say the  the 401  the  the ira is.
i 
in the case of the statute that we're talking with, but they don't have that kind of discretion, do they, in justice ginsburg's example? what i'm getting at is, if you're going to take the example that justice ginsburg has given you as equivalent to the example that we have before us, i think you're fighting uphill and i don't think you have to do that.
so even if the expenditure is very small, but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people, is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol?
anything that  not anything that helps the military raise an army; any communication that a school is required to engage in.
okay, but i still think sooner or later we have to come back to something that you and i went over a moment ago, and that is the  one function, maybe the function, of  of the  of the  the entity claimed here is  is providing cover for the illegal status of the aliens. and it seems to me that there is at least a bare claim here that mohawk is directing the affairs or the business of  of this third entity 
 under the statute.
well, he 
is that based on the premise that section  that district 25 and district 23 are in the same part of the state?
that's my understanding. now 
well, there's on core first amendment values that are furthered when public employers have to justify employment decisions that they make on a routine basis.
and justice scalia, i concede that, but you would also have the ability of the defendant to waive personal jurisdiction. again, you get into the judicial resources. the defendant could choose to waive it at that point in time and then i am right back again 
well, i thought the ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be  resale price  the current dr. miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.
so i guess he would like to know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're talking about. now, does the notice tell him those two things?
well 
but the  the secretary of state's public opinion that we, the enforcement authority, agree with is to the contrary.
he does put that in, your honor, but i don't think that's determinative. if you take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you appeal from the judgment of conviction? answer, yes. if you did appeal, answer the following. and it lays out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new judgment is entered in march of 1998. he is not in custody pursuant to the 1994 judgment. he is in custody 
yes, your honor. but many of the states  a few states have chosen to have special exceptions that just say medical emergency. most of them define 
thank you, counsel. mr. cole.
how many times has it been challenged 
 we take judicial notice of?
it's 
but what's the principle according to which we're drawing it?
i believe that the statements in black 
but the  it sounds to me  if i understood your answer correctly, you're talking about cases in which the named party citizenship is disregarded.
well, that was. but the court 
i  what i  i'm making a separate point here, which is that officers have a continuing obligation to act reasonably in the execution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill that in a variety of ways. they have to be reasonable in identifying the property that's  that's specified in the warrant and that they go to search. they have to be reasonable in conducting the search of places within that property to see that they're looking for the things that are specified in the warrant and not going on a fishing expedition for things that are not. they have to be reasonable in deciding whether they decide to dispense with knock and announce, and they also have to be reasonable in deciding that the basis for probable cause that they used to support the issuance of the warrant has not become so stale that a reasonable officer would know that that warrant should not be executed.
it wasn't until we got into the federal court that there was an error found. as far as the state was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, chapman or not, because there was no error.
same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?
would you explain to me again why it's okay that your waiver argument below was only directed to the claims against vmi?
that's correct, justice ginsburg. the question has been, from the beginning of this case, when the blood came to get on mr. house's jeans.
well, that  they're not ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold that they have to be is certainly an invalidation. and the d.c. circuit, of course, held that the statute doesn't require identity as between the two sets of regulations. and we're not here on certiorari from the new york decision, we're here on an enforcement action in which a court leapt over the express limitations imposed on it, declared the language of the regulations irrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather dramatically.
well, i think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, i think the court has to assume that  that the jury could have found an hour. but what i'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. and so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. and  and that's why they fought it on the facts. they haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. and with respect to handcuffing, i think our position on the handcuffing is that summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. and the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. and i think what  what summers indicated was that this court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. and when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around 
i would agree, your honor. and i think 
now, isn't the fact they're 
it's a report. the statute says that the reports have to be made public.
so it's symbolic that race counts?
ms. maynard, may i interrupt and just ask this? do we have to decide what the arizona rule is in order to decide the main question presented  namely, whether the analogy to arizona public officials is sufficient?
well, why don't you focus on that? because it's a little hard to plan on overruling that case. [laughter.]
 which otherwise wouldn't be imposable. it seems to me that what cuts against that interpretation is the fact that it does try to set some standard. it says, "an order remanding the case may require payment of just cause  just costs and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees." especially the "just costs," that's a standard. it's not saying, "you can use rule 11 and apply whatever standard rule 11 contains." what's your response to that?
yes.
 whether it was for newly discovered evidence or something else. but you  your motion was limited to damages. and i really don't think that you can get where you want to go from a motion that is limited to damages, when you didn't need to. you could have made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.
in the southern 
you mean if in fact the plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.
that's all right. i wouldn't think that was a problem. but what about justice stevens' question. there are 20 districts in our state  it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it  and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the students, and the poor district has another quarter. so our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating from our calculation are the rich district and the poor district. one's at the top, one's at the bottom. and now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether they're equalized. but those 18 districts account for less than half or about half of all the students. that's the problem. it seems that isn't very representative and we're trying to get representativeness.
if the model of this case, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have an actual patient class action and the court says the statute cannot be applied to a medical necessity, period. no fancy frills of adding another things which courts generally don't do. but then there would be no regulation of medical emergencies. why isn't that what  doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've brought and couldn't the first circuit have done that and then you would have no complaint about the rest of the statute?
i mean, i thought you were saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery is concerned 
what  what do you make of the language, any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent? i mean, the claim here is that  that the  that the delay did not result from that fact, but simply from the failure of  of the judge to make that determination so that what you're really doing is making a harmless error analysis.
(d)(3).
yes, okay.
exactly.
but a paperback version of war and peace is less dangerous? it seems a 
it  it does not 
and what was the question?
they don't have to.
we didn't have smugglers before then?
i don't think so 
in that forum, we will agree to binding arbitration.
why do you presume that? someone sitting in a chair with gun  with a gun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and said, oh, it's the police. let's see what they want?
oh, no. guam  presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions. we don't  that's their business. it's just a question of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question in that context.
mr. strain, you  you mentioned 
so you'd have  official
i'm not sure that's correct.
 exercise.
i believe it was wrapped within the concept of a probable cause determination. and they did specifically state that if there was an adverse determination, that notice of that determination has to be conveyed to her. that was, i believe, the fourth prong of our analysis.
we are not finished with the claims objection process. i believe that once we are 
under mississippi law, would he be entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he asked for the wrong lesser offense? i.e., in this case, if he failed to ask for heat of passion, would he still be entitled to a correct lesser instruction, even when he didn't ask for it?
justice scalia, the number of states that engage in these executions is very small, and if it were all of the states, none of this court's eighth amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come  would ever have to be developed. but 
when you say they drew, you mean the gi forum proposal?
thank you, mr. minear. mr. somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?
no 
if you just go to the doctor and ask for advice and he says, yes, i've looked at the results; you've got a vitamin b deficiency or whatever it is 
but only to ask the police and the police are not obliged to respond.
 a ratification 
i know, but 
so there  before this statute, there never is going to be a circumstance in which you bring in a person under rule 19 and diversity is destroyed.
well, yes, your honor. the nature of the relief is certainly different under the hobbs act than under the face act. also, of course, at the time this action was brought, 19 years ago, the face act didn't exist.
and i'm just wondering if that 
 but let me ask you whether 
but, again, i don't think that  there's no  there's no suggestion in  the problem  the ultimate problem with that point for the government, justice stevens, is that it requires us to believe that congress formed that intent in 1991, which is an impossibility, because 
well, your honor, yes, i do because of the nature of congress' control over whether or not there should be federal private rights of action. it is consistent with the court's implied private right of action jurisprudence from alexander v. sandoval, from the central national bank of denver case, et cetera.
yes. that 
no, and this court has said and the lower courts have said that that is not the requirement, because the injury here that the taxpayer complains of, as the court said in daimler chrysler, is not an increased tax burden. the injury is the expenditure of funds in a way that violates the establishment clause.
thank you, mr. utrecht. the case is submitted.
 "government's expenses."
well, to be sure, justice o'connor, the third circuit's view is broader than that which appears to be adopted by the ninth circuit, as well as the seventh circuit. and i think this brings me back to the definition of review. the  the ninth and seventh circuits' views in our estimation are wrong because they strictly look to the subjective intent of the plaintiff and as to whether the plaintiff is, in fact, seeking reversal. that  that's the term that's used in these cases. noel says seeking to set aside. but section 1257 
you still have 
but can i just 
right. it is 
mr. fisher, you know, assuming we read it the way you read it, i've got a official basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get to the end of the briefs and i wonder if you would comment on it at the beginning of the argument. that is  or i'll put it in the form of a question. is the decision which the judge makes here to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a decision that requires the finding of any fact about the commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances of those crimes or about the defendant's character? does the judge have to make or does the fact  some fact finder have to make a finding on any of those subjects  crimes, circumstances, character of the defendant?
with the  with the tenth circuit's theory or 
but they  they provide expressly that these are rights that may be asserted individually in national courts?
that's right.
yes.
it would break the hydrological connection. however, this court has ruled in the riverside case that those wetlands which are adjacent to navigable waters  it did not reach the issue whether they were not adjacent to non-navigable waters. they only addressed the  this court only addressed the issue of relationship to navigable waters. in that case, this court specifically found that wetlands adjacent to navigable waters were regulated. the court specifically reserved the 
yes.
no. but in this case the counsel for the defendant did one other thing, and it said to the judge, you don't have authority under state law to add to these supplemental instructions. and i was going to ask you, he was right about that, wasn't he?
but that's what his predecessor had.
now, do you take the position that the federal government couldn't enforce any provision of such an agreement either?
well, i'm sure. (laughter.)
well 
your honor, several responses. first, the undisputed evidence here is that women in some emergencies, every minute is critical. every minute puts them at risk of losing their future fertility and of major organ damage. that is confirmed by the nation's leading medical authorities which say that there is - that even very short delays 
there is not.
but is that necessary? i  i mean, that's what i think is the difficult question here. can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court, but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right to change his mind within the court? that  that makes a lot of sense to me, but i don't know if it's possible to get there. why not? i  i think, well, the reason is that you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you don't have that problem when you're talking about an appeal.
why is it 
i think that's right, your honor. whether you call it "discretion" or "factfinding authority," i think that's right. that is a separate question from what we have here. but i think the district court would have the first-line authority and the main 
but that search was a consequence of his employment. it  this wasn't a search of a  of a citizen who had no connection with the government. it was a search that he was required to submit to as an employee. so to  to describe it as unrelated to employee action seems to me unrealistic. the only reason he submitted to it was that if he didn't, he would have  he would have been subject to an employee action.
then why did you name it, in the complaint, as the defendant?
but 62(a) gets to the reinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a  in an enterprise, and here you have the opening of the facility right next  not right next door  nearby the other facility. and it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured.
it's  it's a different standard as well, your honor, because under summary judgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability  have to view all the inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and  and the small business could end up being dragged into the litigation further and further than i think congress intended.
that  that is correct.
why is it  why is it worse for  for judges to be overseers of religious life in prison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious life in prison? i mean, somebody has to say what the lines are, what will  what will be accommodated and what won't.
i don't know what your test is.
well, again, that assumes that the  that the  the rule compels the interpretation that the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing, correcting, and resubmitting his report. i submit it does not compel that interpretation, and the tax court 
and what's the texas case that says that?
we do not have any statistics. and, of course, when  when somebody gets off, it results in  in an acquittal and so we don't get published decisions about that.
no, we don't, your honor.
do you think it would valid? that's what i was asking you.
yes. they try to distinguish national organization for  for women in two ways, justice scalia. first, they say that in national organization for women, the potential patients, the customers, were a constituent part of the  of the health clinic's business. that's true here also. but more important, they say in their reply brief that this court only decided that case on article iii standing. that is not correct. if you look at respondent's brief on the merits filed in that case in september 1993, both issues were raised, article iii standing and rico standing, meaning injury plus proximate cause.
at what point in your view did that stay become dissolved?
well, first of all, your honor, he 22 did not make that argument. he never asked if it was 23 frightening that he had learned from this. the word 24 frightening  again, this has been used out of context by 25 my  my learned colleague  went to  strictly went to 1 the discussion of similarities between the crimes, not the 2 defendant. and in this situation 
thank you, general clement. mr. mellen?
in all due  in all 
present and future defendants.
no, no. they didn't think he did do it.
 it plausible that congress, in effect, would have intended these  the statute of limitations on 1983 to be truncated in that way?
it is our position that it  it does fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding whether the  whether payton's jury was unconstitutionally precluded from considering the evidence, you look to the  all the instructions. and when you consider the direction to consider all  that you shall consider all the evidence and then the concluding instruction 
right, and  and the language should be what counts most. but beyond that, you're talking about congress 
in practical reality, that's correct, justice scalia. what the chapter 13 trustee does is, if a plan is not filed, moves to dismiss the case. if a plan is filed, may look at the plan. if the plan is confirmed, acts as the disbursing agent. the debtor typically makes payments under the plan to the chapter 13 trustee. the chapter 13 trustee then makes distributions to creditors. and on chapter 13 day in many jurisdictions, one day a week or every other week, the chapter 13 trustee will come to court with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of files.
well, there's not 
that's what it is.
well, in "weighing" states, the eligibility factors form the primary aggravation for the jury to consider at sentencing. in california, the reference to the eligibility factors is that one subpart of one of otherwise completely distinguished from eligibility factors 
because?
not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline. not necessarily. it depends upon what happens across the globe with respect to greenhouse emissions.
 say to you that i think, first of all, the first amendment right that was at issue there was the general right that's possessed by the public to attend court proceedings, not just a right that was inherent in the newspaper or the  a right that was prophylactically being exercised there. justice kennedy, you asked the petitioner's counsel about alternative remedies here, and i think there's an important point to make with regard to title iii of the ada, and that's the title of the ada that applies, not to public entities, as we have here, like the state prison, but the title that applies to public accommodations, like restaurants and hotels. and it's important to note, i think, that, in that title, congress did not provide for money-damages remedies. quite the contrary, it provided for an attorney general action, and it provided for injunctive relief. and so, the notion that states somehow are special and should be the ones that get damages against them for violating the  violating access rights is, in words that the court has used  in boerne and the cases following it, that is a real indignity to the states. and, beyond that, the standard that applies 
i couldn't find any case in this court that said that. i mean, i found in hamling a case that went the other way, a general statement. they said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et cetera.
 the standpoint of coercion 
there is no customer testimony, no evidence of diversion to any favored dealer in this case, no evidence that reeder lost profits because of the price given to any favored dealer, only evidence that if reeder had gotten a price, it would have  better price  it would have made more money. well, every dealer can show that.
but it isn't even because, after all, beck talked about an instruction where the choice was either convict the person of murder, death penalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve an instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give him a life sentence or acquit him. so we don't even know if  if beck applies to your case. that's never been decided.
your honor, what the district  what the district court concluded as a matter of law was that it  that notwithstanding dr. blake's testimony regarding the source of the blood found on mr. house's jeans, that that did not eliminate the  eliminate the testimony of agent scott who said that he saw blood on the jeans when he first  excuse me. let me rephrase that because it's actually a critical matter. he saw what he thought appeared to be bloodstains on the jeans when he first picked them up. what the district court did in that instance was exactly the error that mr. house has brought to the attention of this court, which is in the face of evidence of innocence, the district court, simply because it found some contrary evidence in the record, found that mr. house had failed to make his showing.
well, isn't the  isn't the reason it's consonant is because, in those cases, there is a  the connection, in terms of the purposes of the rule that was violated and the evidence that was seized?
i  i don't think this is going to work.
what degree of marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to override the state's interest? i mean, if you have official complications under the d&e procedure in say 10 percent of the cases, complications under d&x in 9.99 percent of the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to override the state's articulated interest?
how long did the penalty phase take?
yes, footnote 3 of the red brief explains that this purported concession that they discuss about the use of this mark had to do because justice ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but assuming they occurred, those were descriptive. in 1998 and 1999, petitioner started using this on their marketing brochures in a very different manner.
do you acknowledge that the corporation that you sued, lincoln property company, is a texas corporation?
 1101(a)- 
part of 
well, i don't believe the court has ever put it quite that way in the government speech cases, the government funding cases.
i disagree with that, your honor. certainly not  i don't think there's any empirical evidence to suggest, with respect to any of the things that your honor just identified  and let me pick out the ipod as one, because it's the most current example, i guess. from the moment that device was introduced, it was obvious that there were very significant lawful commercial uses for it. and let me clarify something i think is unclear from the amicus briefs. the record companies, my clients, have said, for some time now, and it's been on their website for some time now, that it's perfectly lawful to take a cd that you've purchased, upload it onto your computer, put it onto your ipod. there is a very, very significant lawful commercial use for that device, going forward. and, remember, i  what our test  our test is not "substantial." our test is that it's a  it's a  when it's a vast-majority use, like here, it's a clear case of contribution 
the master found that the role of the river master in the pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here. he found that the role of the river master in the pecos cases was really ministerial.
your position is, it should be like any other civil case.
your  your honor, i believe there are alternative channels of communication here.
the ninth circuit did limit its holding to issue preclusion. it did not rule on claim preclusion.
no, your honor.
yes, your honor, for purposes of the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the term differently.
thank you, counsel. mr. cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.
well, i  i'm just talking about what the understood requirements of a fraud action were at common law. mail fraud, any kind of fraud. surely there has to be some reliance upon the fraud.
that is correct, your honor.
okay. but you're saying it's a world of difference if, when they go in and enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a sudden, it's invalid from there on. those are the  they're two different cases in your mind?
how do you  how do you answer the government's argument that this is necessary, that the united states shouldn't effectively be punished for being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people, if we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can dump anyone it wants on the united states and we can't stop it?
 competing positions. is there anything that ferc has issued that is illuminating with respect to their view?
yes, i believe it is, your honor. when texas was subjected to the integration decree, the one area of the prison that was not part of the decree that they did not require them to integrate was the area that is the equivalent of our reception center. there  there in 
in the ordinary case.
your honor, his lawyer would advise him, in those circumstances, that the competing harms defense would protect his actions because he needs to act urgently necessary  in an urgently necessary circumstance.
well, the prime variance case is stirone versus united states in the 1960s, where the court very simply said that where nothing is alleged official this cannot be treated as a simple variance.
no.
what about self-defense?
yes, but i  i 
i thought there was a special provision for capital cases.
your answer to justice kennedy, i glean from what you said, that if new york took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.
 you 
that  at this point, the question of the 
yes.
i  i think you have to give that answer to justice  to justice breyer, and that's why i'm asking. i  i think you just have to say that this is inherently inconsistent with the atmosphere we want to have in a courtroom. it seems to me  i  i'm not quite sure i can find a lot of authority for that, but it seems to me that has to be your argument.
 in givhan, if the employee's assigned duties were all done competently, but she had just gone off the deep end on racial balance or something, the employer would not have had  - if  so long as it was the  a private communication like that, i don't know that the employer would have had an interest in saying, "well, you're incompetent on the subject of racial balance, and therefore i  you know, i'm going to demote you or fire you." but in the case in which the employee is talking on the subject within the job description, then the employer has got  i thought you were saying he's got a direct interest in competence, truth, and so on.
i was 
so could we say  could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door? a, it must be a  a structure that normally would have a crew or that  a significant amount of the time. we would have a connection to the water. it would be capable of having a master or crew. what about that?
negligent 
i'm not saying any, justice scalia.
but the key word in the statute is "transmission," not "the transmission of letters or postal matter."
counsel, what if the first case against the government were dismissed because of a finding that the employee was acting beyond the scope of his authority? should that really bar a subsequent action against the employee in an individual capacity?
no, your honor. in this case there's  it's not in the record.
would it be sufficient if the officer says, "one, this is a drug gang; two, they don't let people into the house whom they don't know; and, three, they have guns"?
well, this is mr. rhines' one opportunity. congress did give in section 2254(a) jurisdiction to the courts and said the federal courts shall entertain petitions of this  of this nature. so this is a  a right that mr. rhines has to have these entertained. he filed timely.
the notion of strong inference starting with the second circuit doctrine, as used in many other circuits, was actually a much lower standard than what we are recommending. if i believe  if i think back at greenstone, it was reason to believe, or tends to believe, or circumstantial evidence in greenstone and in burlington coat. under our standard of preponderance, the ability to find preponderance, you are elevated. you are also elevated by the preceding subdivision which requires a level of particularization, never known in federal rule 
no, you take the position, then, that  going to the earlier hypothetical that somebody brought up, that, say, in a brady case, if the  if the federal prosecutor believes there was brady material that  and let's assume he's correct, just to make it a simple case  that there's brady material to be turned over, and the u.s. attorney says, "do not turn the brady material over," that if the  if the u.s.  if the  if the prosecutor tells this to a court, that he can be disciplined?
that is correct. if all you know is that there is parallel action or inaction, that in and of itself tells you nothing. once you start to add the facts and circumstances surrounding it, particular parallel action can be suspicious enough, and the example you give is a good one, that demonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for believing that discovery may yield evidence showing that that parallel price increase at the same time by nine different companies was the result of an unlawful conspiracy. if i can turn to, in  in deciding whether or not there is such a reasonably founded expectation, you do need to look to the substantive law. here the issue is the law on agreement under section 1 of the sherman act. some of the questions i think i've heard go to this issue. section 1 law specifically limits the kinds of facts that can be used to establish an agreement that is cognizable under the sherman act. in particular, the court's rulings made clear that conscious parallelism which some economists might argue is a form of an agreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of section 1.
 when they don't have legitimate concerns.
where we  well, i  had agreed to buy it. we had a  clearly, there was an understanding. our sales person thought that, "if i can get this discount at this rate, i can cut this deal," went to  went to volvo, asked for that rate, volvo said no. didn't get the deal.
 a beginning point. you have to give us a beginning point.
it was  it was because of the focus of the florida supreme court on  on whether or not there was a consent.
not by doing that. however, the circuit court of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to its own circuit authority to define the law that is clearly established. it specifically stated that this case, that the state's decision was unreasonable in light of norris. it specifically stated that the state court's decision could not reasonably be distinguished from norris.
well, you're asking us, i 8 suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper 9 records. we've seen a number of capital cases, you know 10  as you know. this counsel seemed to me to be quite 11 articulate and  and had a very sound theory of  to 12 argue to the jury for mitigation. it didn't work, of 13 course. i  i just don't know what constitutional rule 14 you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record 15 evidence?
then why was current  why was inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the subject of summary judgment? it seems to me that to make it a summary judgment is implausible to a nonworldly degree.
i know what you object to, and i know that you think your client isn't covered. but i don't know what test you would have us adopt for what constitutes a tributary.
the reality is that the  these reimbursement terms are in all the contracts essentially of the fehba carriers, and as a result, i think it can be assumed that it's the policy of the government that they should be in here. and the result of them is that they save the government money. so it does make good government policy to have these provisions in  in the contracts to begin with.
what other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the act? what other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?
because the first amendment does not address speech that an employee undertakes in the performance of his duties.
well, shouldn't we leave it to california to adopt such a presumption?
reading the whole text.
yes. yes. a promotion  discrimination in promotion is different analytically than with discrimination with respect to pay decisions themselves. because in a promotion decision the employee is deprived of the opportunity to take on added responsibilities and therefore earn more pay, but in, but the pay itself is not discriminatory in the sense of treating people doing the same work differently.
but the sixth circuit didn't pass on the spending  spending clause issue.
i agree with that, your honor, and my contention as to what the law is is that we are not required to plead plus factors. but the fact remains that we have, and that our factual pleading of plus factors has to be treated as true for purposes of a 
this still goes to the same thing. does michigan do this by grace? if michigan wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and say, you know, all these years we've been letting you come in first, and we only step in when we think you haven't done a good job, but we've had it. (laughter.)
mr. feldman, the government takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year computation?
 that a remark made internally could not provide the basis for discipline, but saying exactly the same thing publicly could. i mean  or vice versa.
well, your honor, it's not exaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that  that congress intended us to be in court one time to defend this judgment in federal court. we were there. he received a 
no, your honor. it's not even a felony in georgia.
that, i think, was the question, and i'm very interested in your answer.
okay.
no.
 you have that problem 
that's what the court held  held in huddleston, yes, your honor.
 negotiate, "i don't" 
what would you think of a rule that said if you use certified mail and it returns uncollected, the additional step you must take, you just send ordinary mail?
 park again for a moment and ask why the government decided to base its claim to the lands in glacier bay exclusively on that murky provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards set out in the idaho case?
so if it was 2 dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol?
all right. i  i have a question that you could just clarify a confusion. you want to bring into this case the question of whether or not anticipatory warrants are ever valid. i had a case in the first circuit where i explained my view on that. i thought they would be reasonably described. so i don't know if that issue should be brought up here. maybe. i can't figure out what issue should be brought up here. there's a van treska case that says we ought to read these things in a common sense fashion. all right? i read it. my common sense says i have a warrant here. it says nothing about anticipatory anything. it says you can go and search for any of 16 items, 14 of which are in his house well before the delivery. after all, he's had all this correspondence with these people about child pornography. they have terrific reason for thinking he might have some. and that's all it says. and then it says, is there probable cause for a warrant that says go in any time now and search for any of these items, including what will be delivered, if that's when you do it? i say i look at the probable cause. his probable cause is he thinks that another package is being delivered, and he's right to think it. now, whether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything really to the issuance of the warrant. it might add to his personal confidence. but that's my common sense opinion. the common sense is the only question here is do they have probable cause to issue a warrant that allows them to search now, because that's what it says. so now how  how, given that  i grant you the ninth circuit went into all kinds of other things, but you explain to me, please, how i'm supposed to reach those other things and what i'm supposed to do, and why i'm wrong.
thank you, sir.
general clement, you have two minutes remaining.
at step three. we've  we've gotten to step three.
 or in fact that we are trying to make this determination?
i thought what you just quoted 10 said that they  that they would intend it to be used in 11 the mitigating phase.
well, if i'm going to err on either side, i obviously prefer that the court carries out congress's intent. we thing you needn't go any further than matsushita did in order to reverse the court of appeals in this particular case. obviously there is probably some potential distance between the two, where you could certainly interpret the strong inference standard more in the line the way the united states interprets it, as creating a high likelihood of scienter. and we don't  we're certainly not objecting to that. we're just saying to the court that you needn't go that far in order to decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a ruling along those lines if the court's inclined to go that far.
certainly.
justice ginsburg, the premise behind our argument is that the article iii hurdle is cleared on other grounds, on grounds that i've already discussed and we can certainly reiterate. the question then becomes  on prudential grounds. and that is the issue that was presented in craig, that she had a direct injury, but she was in  she did not satisfy the prudential standards because she was asserting third-party rights. and what this court there held was, because the parties had adjudicated the issue below without objecting about standing, that the court would proceed to the merits.
your honor, i think that that is a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason that global climate change is a global phenomenon. i mean one 
yes, certainly juries can consider that, and jury case law is in accord. but on the facts of this case, mr. deck's defense in mitigation was not that he was a safe individual or, again, that the murder of these two people was an aberration in an otherwise saintly life. that's not the case. the mitigation defense was that he did these horrible things. he is some  a nefarious individual, but that he should not be sentenced to death because that wasn't his fault. it was his parents' fault. they had done a poor job in raising him. he had suffered difficult circumstances growing up. so there's simply no intersection between the mitigation defense offered here and whatever the jury might take away that might be negative from the fact that he was restrained.
once  once you establish that limitation, are you willing to accept the horrible that  that justice souter proposed to you? is it  is it, indeed, so easy to  to gin up some other cause for arrest when you used a mistaken cause? i don't know that it's all that easy.
oh, i would agree, we can be on the same grounds there.
it is 
okay, but the court of appeals for the federal circuit did not address the case in  by looking at the evidence and whether a directed verdict should have been given 
i assume you could have a company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to monopolize and the means that they choose is just idiotic. for example, they say, we're going to try to get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as, at as low a price as possible. you would have the two elements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you wouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive conduct.
i thought it was remanded for an issue  for a hearing on the consent issue after 
mr. chief justice, the reason that the federal circuit disagrees and over 30 years this special court has elaborated this problem  these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on nonobviousness  is that we need a guidance, we need guidance for the lower courts. we need to focus them on the right question, and for patent examiners and patent practitioners, and the right question is not is  was someone merely capable of putting the two together. the right question is is there any reason to believe that it would have been apparent at the time of the invention to create this invention whether it's through a teaching, a suggestion, a motivation.
and the  and the 
you couldn't have presented evidence that this person was, in fact, a martian.
yes. at least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.
how about the creation of a private right of action?
 under the second 
is there anything in the statute that prevents them from consulting with other nations or prevents the government from doing that when they determine how best to work out whatever standards or other forms of regulation they want?
mr. minear, may i ask you? at the time the statute was passed, was the national government conducting these activities?
certain 
 that footnote  that's where i actually got the idea  it says, "we reserve, in certain situations." to me, that meant sometimes it can be a major big deal to don clothing  protective gear; sometimes it isn't  an apron. and whose job is it? now i'm repeating myself.
you might save your time. yes. mr. shanmugam.
well, there are a couple of responses to that, your honor. first of all, in  in terms of mr. pace, the pennsylvania supreme court has said it wasn't at all clear before, roughly, december of 1999 that you actually need to plead those exceptions in your petition. now they say you should plead them in your petition, but at the time it wasn't clear. certainly the  the form that the prison provides 
yes, you're correct.
excuse me. where  where are you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?
yes.
so that's the case we have. and you're telling me that the only remedy a citizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to fight these actions one by one?
you look at whether he understood that the questioning was going to cease, and it was up to him 
well, the district court's finding was that texas geography and population dispersion limit the availability of district compactness in southern and western regions of the state, and that was at the jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a. so that's  there's  there's a challenge in texas because you've got these 
i think they were concerned with it part and parcel of  because, i mean, i think of the things that congress does when it regulates is, it regulates to protect life, to protect health and safety 
practically, is there any difference between the way they operated when they were just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?
but the problem  the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices. they get together as a syndicate, a syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what price we're going to charge for this initial public offering. it looks, if you didn't understand the context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust violation. and the problem is, i guess, that  that when you take that type of evidence, the type of evidence you're going to be relying on to show that there's price fixing, it is exactly what the sec wants the people to do. they want them to get together. they want them to agree on an appropriate ipo price that's going to contribute to capital formation and everything else. and how do you at, as justice alito pointed out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this isn't the good price fixing?
thank you, mr. bland. mr. landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes remaining.
well, do  do you think it does anything more than just eliminate clearly de minimis action?
and i think we also have to remember that the  the south carolina supreme court was viewing this simply as a matter of state common law. they weren't looking at it as a matter of federal constitutional law.
is there any 
what about damages?
well, which were in particular, we know, affidavits. we also know something about letters, and the question with the tape recording is, is it enough like, does it resemble those enough?
so jones did properly exhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then jones properly exhausted?
and i would also add that when you actually look at the voir dire on which the cca relied in which it said jurors express no discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to falsify their answers to the special issues, the very first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly the kinds of discomfort that this court feared and anticipated with the use of the nullification instruction.
 it's not official just  just because it was decreed by a  you know, a track boss or something. it  it was an action of the company because the company cut  cut off her pay for 2 weeks. right?
 very strange. you would look to the  you would look to the state law for purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of 924(c), what would you look to? either one. either one. official whichever 
you said it was enough to indict and that very same evidence is put before the jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?
and does michigan have such a statute?
well, the word individual is not defined in the statute either, and 
yeah. justice scalia said, you know, they left out this one little bit. why was that critical? what's the answer.
 then the judge could say, "you know, i'm surprised that you haven't raised statute of limitations."
i'm not sure i agree, counsel, that the fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present. for example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.
of course they would be. because you sued them. even if they're innocent  are you saying all innocent parties are not parties to the controversy?
 and i appreciate that. but the text of it, what the regulation said was not significantly different from what the earlier regulation said.
before you get past casey, casey didn't invent this as a definition. casey said it has always meant this in innumerable federal statutes. casey was relying on a longstanding practice which existed long before casey was  was pronounced.
well, if  do you see a difference between  i guess you're saying there's no difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the chief justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.
no, it should not, because there  i think there are concerns with respect to what this court has identified it is trying to, even in the public school setting, quite apart from the university setting, to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas. what is happening here of course in this case, it can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and tobacco just have no place in the schools. and 
well, they're not saying it's an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make a 110 claim. they're saying that the only basis upon which you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship. you have no other. how do you respond to that?
that sounds like a good reason why a court should think long and hard about categorizing this as a question of subject matter jurisdiction.
but it doesn't mean that the next 
that's the state's problem. i mean, if the state doesn't want that, sure, the state can take that away. but if the state does, do i still have to call it property just because the state does?
well, nonetheless, the court made that distinction in the flast case with respect to the establishment clause, and, specifically, the spending and taxing powers exercised by congress. and the court determined, in that case, that the establishment clause was a specific limitation on spending authority. the court has been very careful, and many justices of this court, individually, have said that that distinction in that case will not be extended beyond the establishment clause, in the context of spending, in connection with a religious conviction, or the establishment of a religion. the court has indicated, frequently, i think, that that is not going to be extended. at any rate, it wouldn't be extended  the logic of flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway. this is not an application of the spending power by congress or the taxing power by congress. this is the commerce clause, which is a permissive grant of authority to congress, and, at most, under the dormant commerce clause, a limitation on the states. these respondents are not remotely close to what this court has said are the irreducible minimums. even if they 
part of that discretion is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a likelihood of a different result?
and you're trying to tell us that the initiation can be involuntarily? i just don't  i just don't agree with that.
ms. bunn.
well, that was only part of it. they  they didn't raise money with the anticipation of doing their lobbying with it. in other words, they raised all their lobbying money in their  in their general treasury. the  the only funds they raised in their pac is to advocate the election or defeat of candidates or give money to candidates, which  which this court has recognized is a proper way of directly affecting an elections. but making lobbying into a pac means that, number one, you're going to have to identify that effort to influence a vote  about an upcoming vote in congress, you're going to have to identify that as a political activity.
then why don't we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to vindicate them?
what's the case that says "unambiguously foreclosed"?
our argument is that the first clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an overt act.
 what is the california remedy? let's say his boss says, "don't turn over brady materials."
well, actually in that case there actually was quite a story. in that case there was a story that for years and years you'd had this cold joint problem of laying successive courses of asphalt blacktop, and  and this guy actually saw something that was interesting, that you could use this radiant heat burner to solve the asphalt blacktop problem. that was not what he claimed, though. what he claimed was an apparatus that just had these two things together, and they didn't interact with one another any more than if they had been both put in the same shopping bag. and that's what we have in this case. we have an adjustable pedal assembly that does whatever 
if  if the  if you're  if what you're doing is talking about the, an election statute like 
 retroactivity aspect  i'm sorry.
well, justice breyer, i think puerto rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem. because what you are dealing with there is the elimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a official replacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been a modification under any  i think under anybody's theory, because there would have been an increase in the hourly emissions anyway. so it would have been a nsps subject to the psd. it didn't get analyzed that way but the truth is it would have been fully  the way that decision came out would have been exactly consistent with the way that they analyzed it.
no. the act in 207  i believe it's 207  specifically says that you may, the court may award attorneys' fees in an action in court. it doesn't provide that  there's no similar provision for actions before the commission. but the scope of the kind of official thing that congress decided that a complainant could bring either to the commission or to court is exactly the same. there's no way to drive a wedge between them. there are other provisions of the act, as mr. fisher said, where congress specifically authorized the commission  an action before the commission for damages. but those are  those provisions which mr. fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to do with common carriers. they have to do with automatic dialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that, where the person who's violating it is definitely not the  never going to be a common carrier. in those provisions, congress found it necessary to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to create a damage action. but in other provisions, where you are dealing with common carrier, 206 through 208 provides congress's determination of what the scope of a damage action should be either before the commission or before a court.
 that one should look to a private person in like circumstances. i think this court, in feres, although that decision has been  has been limited  did determine that there was, in that situation, no private-party analog 
thank you, mr. chemerinsky. mr. untereiner, you have 3 minutes remaining.
right.
did they know in advance that he was someone to look for? because i don't imagine you arrest everybody on i-80 that goes 70 miles an hour. i've done it many times myself is why  (laughter.)
does wachovia have any branch banks in michigan?
no. that's before you. in fact, there's a  there's a question of whether they even challenge that. but clearly, that the sentence by the sixth  the sentence was challenged by the sixth circuit and found to be defective and a violation of due  of due process, and that's in the cert 
well, we cited a case on page 24 in our brief, a third circuit case, riley, that says a reviewing court's suspicion may be raised by a series of very weak explanations given for the strike.
okay.
and your fee applies to all michigan-plated vehicles. am i correct about that?
is it your argument that any statement made to law enforcement is testimonial?
what about banners? what would you do with banners?
the court 
i 
no, no, of course the people who are there have it, but maybe it's not buffalo. i don't know, maybe it's all of buffalo, new york, or maybe it's a town. i'm not saying that that's the law but i just wanted your view of that. and then i wanted to know this, that on the legal part, i would like your response to the  i take it your answer is yes, they're entitled to the value of it. i'm right about that, that is your answer?
what are you relying on in the georgia constitution? it doesn't mention counties, does it? it just says except as specifically provided in this paragraph, sovereign immunity extends to the state and all of its departments and agencies.
thank you, counsel.
well, let me take you to the lines of cases that i think might concern you. there were a set of cases before this court's decision in hazen paper that involved two rules, justice breyer, and i will tell you that you referred to in the adams oral argument when this case  this issue came to you before. and so i want to refer to a very specific set of cases. there were a set of cases before 1993 in which there was some correlation. high salary correlated with age. and the courts of appeals, the third  the second circuit in the geller case and the eighth circuit in the leftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate treatment  disparate treatment case because of the high level of correlation. the more recent cases reject that result and we embrace the more recent cases. and i want to cite them to you so you could look them up if you wanted. the evers case, which is 241 f.3d 948; the williams case, which is 112 f.supp.2d 267; and the last one is newport mesa, 893 f.supp 927. these cases recognized that cost is a perfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a single burden on the employer. now, let me just  just to say, most impact cases aren't cost cases, but i know it's a concern. they say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of your more expensive work force, we're only going to ask you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior workers to take a pay cut. they do not say, as did the older cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose your case. and so we don't 
and if they don't  and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this court say, this is the same case? there is only one case. it isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think that district judge was wrong. we think that federal district judge never read dabit, which isn't surprising since it was decided after he wrote the opinion. (laughter.)
can i ask you a question about the other part of your case, which is that the judge cannot consider in  in step one anything except the  except the  the racial strikes and  and nothing else and cannot even speculate as to what causes might have produced the strikes? that seems to me rather extreme.
that's right.
their  they had no knowledge of the illegality, and the evidence that was  that was the basis for the affidavit for the warrant was untainted by the illegal entry. but, of course, the same is true here, there was  there is no allegation at all that 
your honor, there is a difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives  in chambers v. marsh, this court emphasized that the prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer. this is very much sectarian. this proclaims that there is a god. it proclaims 
when, for example, there's an undercover agent, a law enforcement officer  let's think of the mafia or the ku klux klan reveals himself. one of the co-conspirators during the ongoing conspiracy switches sides. but no. he doesn't switch. he's still in the conspiracy. makes a whole lot of statements. those are all inadmissible, though they'd come in now because they would be in the furtherance of the conspiracy.
sorry. i have laryngitis. can you hear me all right?
yes, and  and i  i do want to say  and i don't know how to say it more  more clearly  i understand it, but i'm obviously not framing this in a way that is getting my point across. i'm not suggesting that because people  these are the most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the entire 38,000 inmate prison system, that that means that they can get anything that they want. i'm suggesting that when you take away a very significant right  and that is the ability to learn what is happening beyond the prison walls  there has to be a reasonable basis for doing so. now, if i've been reading turner and o'lone and overton incorrectly, then i'm doing a disservice to my clients.
nothing at all compels the state to do that.
no  so no circumstances can the issuance of the mandate be extended after this court has denied the petition for writ of certiorari?
 that's correct. that's right. let me turn, just for a second, to  getting back to the complexity here, and the linedrawing that has to be done. the petitioner's own hypotheticals underscore the arbitrariness and unworkability of their approach. in  if you look in the reply brief, at page 13, note 11, they cite, as an example, a county emergency-room doctor who  and then they put "is not part of their normal duties," to sort of build it into the hypothetical  would have a right, a first amendment right, to come forward and talk about inefficiencies in a county emergency room. whereas, the state health inspector, who finds health code violations in nursing homes do not. the first amendment value in those situations are the same. and, if anything, it's greater for the county emergency  for the  for the  i've said this backwards  the county emergency-room doctor who's talking about how the  how the county hospital is operating. there's no difference there. and it's a completely arbitrary linedrawing. suppose ceballos had gone outside the chain of command, suppose he had reported to garcetti that there was police misconduct. it's not clear where that position would  where their position would lead them. now it's not part of his normal job duty to go talk to the da. he's bypassed the chain of command. but it seems that they would say that, "well, because it was not part of his normal job duty, it  then it would be protected." and, if so, what message is that sending public employees about whether they should follow their employer's own rules about how you communicate in the workplace and what the chain of command is? it doesn't make any sense to force public employees to go public, as that does more to increase disharmony and disruption in the workplace than having an employee like ceballos, who followed every rule and every order and instruction regarding how to handle the case and how to communicate within the workplace. connick said that the first amendment's primary aim is the full protection of speech upon issues of public concern, as well as the practical realities involved in the administration of a government office. the proposed rule is inconsistent with that primary aim. it doesn't do anyone any good to have u.s. attorneys and das blind-sided by coverups in their office because their employees were afraid to come forward and tell their supervisors the bad news.
so that if 10 other circuits have ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can do until somebody within the 1-year window files.
if it's 50 percent infringement in the short run? we think, absolutely, yes.
 transmission.
right. i  i'm not disputing that it  that  that a  a prosecution should not be brought or should not be heard 
the question is what procedures are required. and we've given a lot of discretion in prison administration.
 expressed disapproval with this very-close-nexus standard by which the fourth circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal citizenship rules for a limited partnership the notion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its activities had a very close nexus with the state  and i'm referring now to the passage, justice ginsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the petition appendix. there are four page  four sentences on those two pages that capture the error of the fourth circuit. and, just below the bottom, it says  it says, "the real party in interest owns land and operates a substantial part of its business in virginia, thus establishing a very close nexus with the commonwealth."
 invoke.
thank you mr. owen. the case is submitted.
and i believe the court indicated that it would be possible if there were practices and policies that had been established that set substantive standards for continuing that there would be a property right in a fair procedure for determining that internally at the school.
let's take this case. did the government use any of the evidence that stone produced? did it introduce that affidavit which said the pipe wasn't working right? was that part of the evidence?
thank you, general. the case is submitted.
but, of course, that's how it happens when he's in prison.
that's  that's true. i mean, at that point, we think it would just be a policy decision. again, we think that congress made the policy decision that the tests should be harmonized.
your  your view of the word in navigation does all the work here. and so a  a concert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock for, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and those other 5 days they  they move it from one town to the next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is in navigation or not?
the constitution does say property right. i mean, it has to be a property right, doesn't it? is that meaningless? is everything in the world either life, liberty or property? does that describe everything in the world?
 perkell, perhaps you'd like to save your remaining 
so, it's as if it said, "go get them on social security, under 407, which is gone now, but only for 10 years."
well, i guess this is probably not a question for you, but a question for your friend on the other side. you can ask, why does it hurt? you can also ask why does it help? what good does it do to bounce the whole thing back when you're just going to have them filed again?
i need to write a simple rule. all i'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. is your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal  an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing left for the jury to do on that charge. that's what it means. when he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change it. is that your rule?
well, certainly under the terms of the president's order, where the president said that he's determined it shall  should be given effect, quote, "by having state courts give effect," by the express terms of the order, particularly as explained in the united states' brief, where that is conjoined with the position of the united states, that in this proceeding, on appeal from the first federal habeas proceeding, that there is no effect to the avena judgement. that's the position the united states has articulated. and so, to the extent this court gives deference to the executive's position  and in matters of foreign affairs, this court has historically given great deference to that position  that position states that that should have no effect upon this proceeding.
with respect in the one respect it is the three pence itself that is the establishment violation. it is the act of handing government money into the coffers 
what about claims 1, 2 and 3?
and wainwright against sykes was even decided before aedpa was passed, too.
thank you, mr. stewart. the case is submitted.
which are those two?
no, your honor, not great weight because, again, that would violate the statute.
it was the first paragraph, and i was reading from the end of that paragraph, your honor, the  which begins, "thus," three lines  really two  the word "thus" is at the end of the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, your honor.
it 
well 
i don't know the answer to that question, justice stevens. i think it would be a very unusual rule.
no. that's 
that's right. the spelling is a little bit different, justice scalia. but congress  the  the name of the statute tells you something about congress' intent. the otherwise licit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't the equivalent of selling drugs. now, maybe if you have a prior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of 21, congress said you get your sentence doubled whether it's a state, federal, or foreign conviction, but under 924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in 922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a state or federal conviction. we can't ignore the overall statutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to domestic matters. the government in their brief says foreign convictions are used all the time, and they give three examples. they say we recognize them for the purpose of extraditing american citizens. they say we recognize them because if you're convicted of a  a sex offense in certain foreign countries, you have to register here. and they say we recognize them  i forget what their third reason is. but there's no example that they gave or that they can give where a foreign conviction is ever used anywhere else in this country as an element of the crime. i mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and state courts have debated back and forth whether we're going to double somebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but it's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime. this  this would be a first, and it's pretty significant. to me it's ironic that the sentencing commission said you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up somebody a few months in the guidelines. but the government here argues that we can use it to satisfy an element of the crime 
well, i don't know that the analysis has to end there. i think, for example, there were other circumstances where other types of communications were problematic. in  in raleigh's trial, for example, cobham had submitted a letter, and that was recited as part of the  the concern. now, if the court were to determine that a recording of that sort was similar enough, it resembled enough that sort of abuse, then yes, it could be testimonial.
well, a consensus view. it would still be the time of the enactment of the statute is what would be relevant, i would think.
some would be the ones that qualified as  what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?
that assumes that there's a  that there's a purchaser that wants to undertake the burden and  and to assume that risk.
well, for two reasons, justice scalia. one is we do have the hue and cry scenario that we've talked about.
textually he  textually under the language of the fourth amendment, he cannot issue the warrant for service at 6:30 when probable cause 
you say by implication.
and the federal tort claims act, for all i know, says, in its prologue  or, if it doesn't, it should have, or it could have  the purpose of this is to assure that every person who's been injured by a  by a government tort obtains relief.
as a matter of fact 
no, your honor. i believe that the author in those  in that situation would receive the same deduction that prior to the enactment of section 703 of the american jobs creation act where congress just addressed in part the  the issue raised in these cases 
on the other side, if westbrook was credible, isn't that strong evidence for the defense?
well, that 
 14 claims an individual brought a retaliation claim but never brought a qui tam suit. it may be that the government had sought this 
yes.
the constitution requires a reasonable search. it is hornbook law that violating no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable search. you're saying that's utterly irrelevant because there's no causal connection between that violation and the seizure of the particular items that the warrant  the warrant specified.
well, garner  garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the back, right?
there was  just to familiarize an attorney getting ready for voir dire of an extensive number of people 
no. we think the better view 
was there any evidence that the jury cards in this  in the actual trial were marked or noted on the basis of race?
no. you have to accept his hypothetical as he gave it. assuming that the attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.
you can finish your sentence.
that's correct.
i think what's contradictory, your honor, is that the notion that the nullification instruction would be an adequate vehicle was what this court specifically rejected.
well, why wasn't that equally true in connick?
there's an only 
well, there's  there is certainly a security component to it. paperback books, small, compact, much more difficult to use as weapons, and the experience of the prison staff that operate this high security unit is that newspapers and magazines are  have been a  a frequent source of mischief.
so  so if  before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about cochran. all right. that's what it says. now, do you think that if tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, i've had a change of heart, johnnie cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television  do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?
well, the problem with, that your honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to present testimony from, for example, his biological mother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the very evidence 
and in effect he would say  i mean, i assume what the clever lawyer would say is, state court, cannot try me at all. the feds can do what they want about remand and it gets back here. but because i'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me at all. isn't that the argument?
wait, i don't  i had not understood you to be arguing, professor tribe, that this would be unlawful, even if the money were raised in the fashion that it is, just from the  just from the cattlemen. and the government's own program used that money to say, "your government thinks it's  wants you to know that beef is thoroughly safe. we've done studies. beef is good for you. you should eat more beef." i thought you 
mr. gornstein.
so they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.
why 
as long as it doesn't discriminate on the basis of price 
yes?
we agree completely. but we also agree that there are some limits that  the court has said that every single dollar that's expended for a bad purpose doesn't give rise to a challenge. my example, if there's a prayer breakfast and all  the only money that's spent is on the bagels, we don't believe the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer challenge to the prayer breakfast.
but is discretion  does discretion on the means to use include discretion to do nothing?
you know, maybe  maybe you're taking our announce and a knock  knock and announce requirement too  too seriously or too literally. i mean, if a police officer comes up and the door is open, what does he have to do? lean over and knock on the side of the door? can't he shout, hello, police? don't you think that satisfies a knock and announce requirement?
well, i thought they were  they were essentially, as i guess you said a moment ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery. so he doesn't do that because they  they settled the contract case with the corporation for what? $46,000?
this is not a matter of  of  over which the comptroller has administrative responsibility, is it? i mean, this is just a matter for the courts as to what court these associations can be  can be sued in. and i don't see how the comptroller has any business in that area.
suppose that you have 10 white jurors and 10 black jurors. the 10 black jurors are all questioned much more extensively by the state, and in each of those cases, there is a plausible reason for excusing. a relative was  served time and so forth. violation?
it seems to me that's quite different from the standard that requires it go to the jury. you send a case to a jury if there's evidence from which the jury could find for the plaintiff.
i believe that's right. it's  it's difficult  i have to confess, your honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the griffin and douglas line, and this court most recently in mlb said that there is a certain merger. also, i believe in smith v. robbins this court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases. but 
of the federal  i  okay.
so in the negligently drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over  the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, if it's not specific as to time and place it must be dismissed? if it's specific as to time and place it's, it withstands the motion?
that's true of every public employee government  excuse me  public employee speech case, period. almost all of these cases go to summary judgment. they can't be dismissed at the pleading stage, by and large, because they require factual development. so, all that  all that this per se rule does is add complexity and a need for greater factual development. it's not the magic bullet that the petitioners seem to think it is. the givhan case suggests the unworkability of drawing the first amendment line as what's part of an employee's job. conferences between a teacher and her principal take in the same level of generality as writing a disposition memorandum 
well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute. i'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference. and you have two regulations that are conflicting. now, how do you decide which one prevails? counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription. counsel also says that this is an agency regulation. the agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations. and even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?
it went off primarily under discretionary function, but then in addressing the arizona  the good samaritan doctrine under arizona, it relied on the myers case, which is a case in which  the sixth circuit said that when you have the case  or safety inspections like the federal  like msha, that court would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that there could never be an assumption of duty under  because the government was only in a monitor function. and, to the extent that that's at issue, your honor, i would think that that would be a question, under state law, of whether the government had assumed the duty. and if not under state law, it would be a question under the federal tort claim of whether an  there is an exception that has been met. and there is no exception. i think that this court, in berkovitz, said that regulatory conduct can be actionable under the federal tort claim if it  the discretion isn't met  or the discretionary exception isn't met. and in this case there was an absolute obligation to make these inspections and an absolute failure to do so.
that  that happens all the time. that happens, for example, in the case of incompetent counsel. there's a right to  to competent counsel. if you  if that right is violated, the defendant still has to show prejudice 
 to exclude the  the issue of conduct. i said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. forget that. simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. on the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?
there's a difference to this extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied up to the dock and never moves is different from something that is actually in the water and whether you call it transportation, it is moving? it has to move to engage in the construction of this tunnel.
well, your honor, i think that the example that was given was in relation to the community that was experiencing some uptick in crime.
i thought there was a reg  to be sure we're talking about the same thing  where the ins has said that zadvydas applies to individuals who run into the united states illegally from mexico. am i right about that?
with respect, justice scalia, i disagree. the entire time these prisoners are kept at the reception center, which is a separate part of the facility where the incoming inmates go, that entire time they are segregated on the basis of race. now, the bureau of prisons, for example, has a similar entry section in its various prisons. it's called the admissions and orientations process, and there, using the presentence reports that are provided for by california law, the federal officials evaluate prisoners and their risk levels and have no need to segregate those prisoners on the basis of race.
oh, okay.
does it show it was a vehicle?
and may i be sure i didn't misunderstand something you said earlier? did you say that in most jurisdictions the  by local option, the states have elected to adopt your adversary's 
but  but for this  for this group, while they're in that situation, essentially there's no first amendment rights. i think that's what your  your argument. they can regain them, but that's the purpose of the behavioral modification program. but the  the only thing that these prisoners get is the eighth amendment.
i did.
well, but the  the 
no. in a situation where there was continuing aboriginal title, similar to the senecas in the state of new york where new york state did not terminate the aboriginal rights of the senecas, there need not be congressional act, there need not be congressional or treaty action to establish the reservation.
thank you, mr. cahill. ms. halligan.
no. no. i'm not, i'm saying what do you think it has to be? what do you think it should be? what are, what is it we are distributing? a simple question, i guess, for a statistician. i unfortunately am not one and can't find one, so i have no idea what this statute means. (laughter.)
so, if you want us to piggyback, we  and if it is an article iii question  - we would have to decide that issue before we can decide whether we can piggyback your current claims onto it.
because it's  it's not practical on what happens. as justice o'connor pointed out in her questions, there is such a limited time. the libertarians, as shown in the record in this case, have never and continually do not have the time to build up a voter pool. they have their supporters spread out among a number of political affiliations because there's such a little amount of time that you can register as a libertarian, unlike the vast majority of states. i don't think anyone has ever accused the libertarian party of not having a set philosophy on what they stand for. but the fact of the matter, this court itself has expressed skepticism about whether even party raiding ever exists. people don't go out generally to vote because they want to pick someone who's a bad candidate. they want to vote for someone they feel proud of who expresses their views. the people that the libertarians would appeal to would be republicans and democrats who either weren't going to vote in their primary or those who were very libertarian oriented or people who would be libertarians if they had more opportunity under the law to register as libertarians. they're, in effect, marooned 
no, your honor. i think that principles of stare decisis still govern and i think what, and this is consistent with the position that we have taken with respect to the passage of time extinguishing the possessory right, is what this court for stare decisis purposes found in oneida ii was that there was a violation of federal common law with respect to a transfer that was very different than this transfer, without any examination of the treaty of buffalo creek and without any examination of the treaty of fort schuyler.
but i  i think the flip side of it is that some of those cases involved statutes that appeared on their face to function as express preclusions of judicial review. here, we don't have that. here, the argument as to why administrative procedure act review is precluded is not based on the text of any csra provision standing alone. it's based 
may i ask you 
but that is 
there is  we draw a distinction  and i'm referring just to discharge, i'm not addressing the issue that the court could get to in another case of whether you actually need a discharge of a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river  - we draw a distinction between actually removing something entirely from the river, exercising control over it. your hypothetical, mr. chief justice, had it for 5 years. in that situation, one could say that there may be a discharge into the river when an activity is proposed to pour that back into the river. in a  in the dams  the dams, the water continuously flows down. the water never leaves the single body of water called the presumpscot. and that's the distinction that we would draw.
that's the way it was defined to the jury in this case. that's correct, justice ginsburg. it was  it was  the  the jury instructions went to the jury to find deadly weapon as a firearm. and over and over, the court reiterated, especially in the instructions conference, that the  there's no question but that the only weapon here is a firearm, and so they used the simplified version of the instructions.
because they've taken inconsistent positions. the  the violation here is in the positions itself, not in necessarily the results.
mr. chief justice, our view is that this court certainly could reach the constitutional question presented. and, indeed, there are good reasons that this court should. the oregon supreme court squarely confronted, and resolved, the federal constitutional question, and it is ripe for this court's review. it is true, as justice o'connor suggested at the outset, that the oregon supreme court appears to have been laboring under a factual misimpression  namely, that respondent's mother did not testify at the initial trial. that having been said, it appears to be clear that respondent was seeking  and is still seeking, even before this court  to introduce the live testimony of his mother.
it's my understanding  and this is explained  the details of this are explained in section 3410  i can't give you a citation to the record, but the statutes, i'm presuming, are available  that the distributor pays a  pays a tax as a result of taking the fuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it to various service stations 
i believe that gideon was decided in 1963, justice scalia.
prior to demise?
yes, justice souter.
why did they keep the other 80 percent then?
you can get into trouble by alleging too much, i guess, because if you allege a lot, you might leave something out. and you say, well, what about that one. but suppose we keep it very, very minimal. and a person just says, i'm hurt and the defendant, i claim, negligently injured me. period. period.
well, with respect, justice o'connor, on this record, i don't think that there's any reason to assume that california is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. and i think congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.
thank you, counsel. mr. lichtenstein.
yes. to a third degree of consanguinity, people who are related to you to that degree are not subject to the contribution limit. so, you know, it's hard to justify vermont's scheme if you're concerned about the influence of the wealthy because they're giving the wealthy carte blanche to fund their own campaigns, even under these limits. so a wealthy person who runs for governor  he has no fund raising costs. so  and  and he can get contributions from others that are related by blood, but not by marriage, interestingly, to  to him. so the public funding or the expenditures by  by the wealthy neither give rise to  and both solve  either don't give rise or solve the problems that they claim. so there's  there's  you don't need a remand to consider that  that question, and that is one of the questions that the second circuit has asked that  that the matter be remanded for. now, in addition, the expenditure and contribution limits here are not going to allow even effective campaigns. we have considerable evidence in the record that to run an effective campaign for governor in vermont, it takes $600,000 to $800,000; for the senate 
can the state express its support for religion generally?
pardon?
that's correct, justice scalia. you could. you could prosecute  you could prosecute them as  as separate offenses, but sometimes the government for  just for purpose of simplification will just charge one  one agreement with multiple objects, and one of those objects might be a money laundering object.
a  a minority who was a majority.
justice stevens, one misimpression i believe that the court below was under, and i believe is perpetuated by respondent in his amici, this statute does not preempt a state-law claim. this is not like the cases, for example 
 the enhanced sentence? official
would you require any accommodation  i mean, you have said, "it's up to the faculty to choose which causes to assist"  i think you put it that way, or one of the amici did  "and which to resist." and you've already told me that this happens to be the law school, could be the whole university. could the law faculty, or the university, take the position, "we're not going to  we don't like your message, and we are not going to let you have any of our facilities. we're not going give you the room on the main campus. just a total bar"?
so it's only the circumstances that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence. the general objectives can still be considered.
no, your honor, that is not a thoughtful, objective 
that wasn't my point. my point 
well, why? what if they're just so loud that it's perfectly obvious they're keeping  getting  the neighbors are awake and disturbed by it. does it have to be a threat of violence?
several answers to that, justice breyer. one, the same argument was made in carbone. it doesn't matter who owns the facility. two, this is an argument about why they might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a  i know you don't like hearing about that  but the question here is do we apply strict scrutiny or not. and that goes to the strength of their interest. and then of course the question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory ways? the answer is "very well." since carbone was decided, the municipalities have been living with no flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening period. indeed the best way to accomplish recycling is to charge volume-based fees to, to the  between the haulers and the, and the generators. that's not what is going on here. they're just charging it at the disposal point. so there are plenty of communities all  excuse me  plenty of communities all over the country that are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay for each  you pay  you get a label, like you put on a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label, the label costs a certain amount of money. none of these people have flow  none of these communities have flow control but there's a direct straightforward way. they can also impose regulations directly on the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure they're doing these things. so it is hardly a reason for creating a brand-new public-private distinction.
the whole 
was the board simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?
it's the same fee we're talking about.
was 7.4006 issued pursuant to  what did you call it, glba?
i don't see how non-point source pollution is  is any more remote from what the federal government should be able to do to achieve its ends than is a point source pollution that  that consists of  of dumping sand on land that has some puddles on it. i  that seems to me just as remote.
well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight. now, that's i think how the jury might have interpreted it.
well, what do you think we should do with the 1182? because suppose you prevail on your argument that it's the same statute, the same word, it can't be construed differently under 12-whatever, and the government says fine. we now go to the other string in our bow and we continue to detain this person on the basis of 1182(d)(5)(a).
the petitioner could file such a petition. they have been called "placeholder petitions." but, clearly, under rule 4 of the habeas rules, such a petition would be subject to immediate dismissal by the district court, because it doesn't conform with habeas rule 2, which requires that all of the claims be alleged and all of the facts be alleged.
right. right  it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.
yes, they wouldn't be a party to that suit at that time, though, your honor, in  in terms of raising that issue.
 for the additional law. but again  and it seems to me that just demonstrates the wisdom of justice brandeis' reference to the small laboratories because what we  what we have here are a raft of different approaches that the states take to give either more or less notice so long as you satisfy the constitutional minimum. the problem 
that 
how do we know we know that? because of the, the affidavit he submitted. and he, he's required to submit an affidavit to establish a colorable claim. and, and he's required to allege in his post-conviction petition that his waiver is not knowing or voluntary. but the burden is on the defendant 
i'm saying if this court  well, i'm gleaning the impression that this court thinks it's overbroad.
 defendants.
it's not mandatory. it says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here. we have 8  7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. and they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months. that reflects a lot of thought. seems reasonable to us. and here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. the judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes. and that's basically their reason. now, now  what  the sixth amendment forbids that?
ordinarily do not think of that as covered in this court.
no, your honor. that's exactly the trigger moment. if it has a structure, and it's investigating analogs of that structure to figure out which of these various structures are the best ones to move forward, everything from that point on is fda directed.
i can't imagine the federal court would intervene in an ongoing state proceeding.
 kneedler, if you prevail, would there be anything left over to be argued about in the  for permanent injunction?
 in the field.
thank you, mr. shapiro.
well, heck against humphrey i think would stand in the way of that, your honor.
right, right.
that's possible, your honor. that currently is not the practice, but that is possible.
we're talking about the privacy of individual in his home, and the reasonableness of the search depends upon the reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in his home. is that not the general rule?
because, again, i go back to washington law. and the fact that handgun is alleged in the information does not establish that it's a firearm because a handgun 
i'm sorry?
but if the date of judgment 17 became final prior to the running of (4), then he would 18 not have a year.
they did.
well, the, on this record, and even if you take at face value what's said in the respondent's brief in this case, which is very largely not based on the record, the story is, from mr. engelgau is, fort motor company had a particular requirement and mr. engelgau sat down to design to it. he to design a pedal that had would meet ford's requirements and one way that he did that was to come up with the kind of pedal assembly that's shown in the figures of the patent. but we are not here talking about the patentability of the figures of the patent. we are not talking about the patentability of claims 1, 2 or 3 of the patent; we are talking about claim 4 in which these respondents got a little greedy. claim 4 describes almost nothing 
it depends when you say something about duplicative recoveries, because that seems to be a major concern.
and so 
it seems to me that your argument is that there is always a constitutional right to use what the physician thinks is the safest procedure.
they didn't start over in caterpillar.
well, first i don't think it gives him a cause of action under bivens or the just compensation clause. second 
but each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who've worked for the last 180 days. each premium is divided among all the workers who've been working there for years. some of the premiums are going to go to  to allow the insurance company to pay in the future people who have been there for 20 years.
well, again, i think it  i think it puts an issue  and we raised this in our reply brief, whether or not huddleston should be reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in the way congress is approaching private securities litigation. but, so my 
well, i suppose you could have a contract action that  in which the state promises to turn over a particular parcel of land that it owns, or even, for that matter, a gold bar that is on somebody's  some state functionary's desk. and i guess you could have a suit for that gold bar or for the piece of property. and i guess you could call that an in rem action, if you wanted to. but it wouldn't be.
but that  that was so obviously a slip, and judge hall pointed that out in her dissent. defense counsel too confused  was confused on the numbers. obviously, it  the  the prosecutor wasn't trying to say a grandmother is going to be excused  is going to be struck because she's young.
the vast majority have committed minor crimes. and it's not a rational 
well, we think that their analysis of the error was fairly complete. they refer to the critical aspect of it. they talked about the standard that should be applied. and they made clear, as they have  consistent with their holdings, that because all the other evidence that related to the burglary, felony murder, special circumstance, or eligibility factor and the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" eligibility factor, since all of that evidence was properly before the jury and the prosecutor, and nothing about the arguments or the instructions emphasized the independent weight of those eligibility factors in the sentencing, that, therefore, there was no harm.
but, i mean, you see the point. the point is i don't see how it's administrable in a law, particularly in an economic context 
i think 
if that opinion is read  and i think fairly it has to be  as saying only fraud and not errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't recognize that to be a judgment  it's not what congress thought it was giving you  then that would be  i can't tell you there's cases where this happens, but that  but the  the rationale for including fraud would exclude  include some other similar errors of magnitude. that's our only 
well that may be a very  it seems to me that those may be good arguments, or at least relevant arguments against the applicability of rico in the first place. but if rico is found to have been violated, i take it it would be an extension of qualified immunity jurisprudence 
is that the same as active inducement 
if the, if the object code itself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed, is supplied from the united states 
i'm 
absolutely, justice stevens, and  and the court's opinion suggests that even if it hadn't applied the miscarriage of justice standard, it would have had grave doubts about the exercise of that power precisely because it involved the extraordinary circumstance of reaching out and taking the case back from the state court system. the  the fact that the federal stay of execution was in place i think is especially important to  in addressing the state's argument, that there was nothing preventing the state from going back and 
i don't see where wesley 
 it really seems to me you're adopting quite an extreme position, because it does seem to me perfectly obvious if, for example, they got a lawyer or brought his parents in, and they talked it over for 20 minutes and said, "we think he ought to do it." 
well, that's the difference, not the lack of public interest 
your point, i thought, was that that would be the incentive for 
the statute. by statute.
yes, okay. now if you lost in the state court, could you then use that as a basis for asking this court to accept jurisdiction? and if they  if we did, we took it and we heard the case, reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under the statute?
well, i disagree, your honor. in graham in particular, the court was not just considering youth, the court was considering a troubled childhood, a difficult childhood in which graham's mother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his custody shifted from relative to relative. that's exactly the same kind of evidence we have in cole.
i don't know off the top of my head, justice souter, whether there's a specific document that says marketing includes pricing. but i don't think that anyone had any doubt that this included pricing. and indeed, the respondents, of course, in bringing their challenge, haven't framed this as a challenge to the ability and right of the joint venture to set its prices. what they've challenged is the subsequent decision that was made to sell the texaco-branded equilon gasoline and the shell-branded equilon gasoline at the same price.
pendent party jurisdiction.
yes. what percentage would you guess? just make a rough  roughest conceivable guess.
but the language does seem to say it.
it may be not in a 
would your rule apply in the case of a guilty plea?
and you don't dispute that the purpose of the knock-and-announce rule is not to allow the targets of the search to dispose of evidence, or anything of that sort.
may i ask this 
well, i think that the closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption area where the court has held that, you know, the removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is found by the district court, that functionally terminates the litigation. but i would point out that even in the federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate review of a district court's decision that the federal officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an action. so what the securities defendants here are asking for is something congress didn't even give to federal officers.
new legal  this is the part that i think we have to look both at 60(b) and the statute. new claims  new claims  are brought under 2244(b)(2). same claims are either going to be barred by (b)(1) or, if heard at all, under 60(b).
but i'm still puzzled 
 anything.
i mean in district 24.
to get the additional time for an opposition that would be considered here, you have to file the petition for cert. in other words, if you don't file after the 90th day it's no longer pending.
all i'm  all i'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. you don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on first amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. that's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. california does not adopt that rule. therefore, mr. tory can always  if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend 
mapp was a long time ago. it was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?
your honor, that's in the joint appendix at page 3, which shows that  official
the initial wait 
dod schools. what do you do with them? are they governed by the apa?
i understand that. i'm curious to know what your view is.
it was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong. one reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad. we thought that was a reason why it was wrong then. we think that's a reason why it is wrong now, and we would like the missouri court, but they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong for that reason.
what case is your closest one to support the view that the court should adopt some particular rule here, based on the scheme?
 held outside 
but you did say 1332(c) does not apply to the national bank. it's only one location.
where do  where do we find those findings? where in the record do we find the findings about individual people?
i don't care 
perhaps 
well, maybe if the warden says that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to accommodate.
the  the way the courts have addressed that issue, your honor, is they  they have looked to the  the initial phrase of the statute, in an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs not sufficiently closely enough related to the action or proceeding to justify an award. and also courts have applied the rule 54 reasonableness standard in ordering costs under this provision, and therefore, expert costs have been reduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the general requirements of rule 54. i would like  i would like to 
that might 
the way that california has interpreted that  in fact, there is a case that's cited in these briefs, people versus cain, and morris  which is on our merits brief, in page 27, and in our reply brief, on page 6  where a defendant in california argued that that reference to "special circumstances" ought to be excised from the direction to the jury of what they're to consider at sentencing. and in rejecting the idea that that should be excised, the california supreme court said, "an instruction not to consider the special circumstances would defeat the manifest purpose of factor (a) to inform jurors that they should consider, as one factor, the totality of the circumstances involved in the criminal episode that's on trial."
thank you, counsel. mr. joseffer.
well, not if it just refers back to the states, would it?
we do believe that it is entitled to chevron deference because they have delegated rulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the because of language in subsection 
isn't the problem, and maybe i'm missing, and i may be missing something here, but isn't the problem with your argument is that the statute didn't come out and say you can't remand. the statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy that you and i were talking with before. a court can say look, i know that i have article iii jurisdiction here, but in point of fact i am, i am remanding because what you and i are calling here the pendent claim does not support any of the government's theory. if that's the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling. but if on the contrary, the judge said, as i think the judge said here, i am remanding because based on this analysis, i do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is conclusive. that is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling, official and as justice scalia said, we have said over and over again, however erroneous it may be, it is not reviewable.
all right. now, my question actually is the  aside from 22 justice souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the 23 language here is different from daniels and different in 24 the other cases. the language is the date on which facts 25 supporting the claim or claims presented could have been 1 discovered. and facts supporting the claim prior to there 2 being a claim are not facts supporting the claim. and 3 therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the 4 moment when he presents the federal claim. no earlier 5 than that could it run. so you have a year from the time 6 that you present the federal claim. at that point, all 7 those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now 8 he has a year to call them to the attention of the court. and of course, for reasons that you point out, 10 this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered 11 earlier. he could have brought his motion long before. so what's wrong with that? it combines the 13 practical reason that justice souter mentioned with the 14 language of the statute.
i'm sorry?
on parole, or not on 
justice ginsburg, our position is that that is prohibited by the constitution absent past discrimination.
chief justice roberts, i 
yes, your honor, it does. and we would agree that it bears on the exercise of discretion. and, in a circumstance such as this one, where the attachments, the record itself, indicated that there was a discrepancy between the position the state was taking and what the record actually reflected, it was appropriate for the district court to raise the issue and then consider the interests of the parties. if the district court had been presented simply with nothing in the record, just a blanket statement by the  by florida that, "we concede," and there was nothing to raise the question, then we would  we would say that it's not appropriate for the court to simply pull issues out of the sky.
 we think it does, for several reasons. first, with respect to the constitutional requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. this  we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking  we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in the country. beyond that, even where the uniformity clause applies  and there's, for example, a parallel uniformity clause for bankruptcy  that's never been interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct under state law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and official that there can't be a variation. the state-law homestead exemption under the  under the bankruptcy laws is a good example of that. but, going beyond that, with respect to the issue of uniformity generally, congress has established uniform standards in section 1101, either in terms of identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was actually imposed. in this case, we think, with respect to drug-trafficking crimes, it  it's imposed a uniform standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has to be a felony. that's  that is uniformity. but the  to answer your point more directly, it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to state law, not to  not to a  some supposed uniform standard of federal law. and, for example, if you  several subparagraphs  and if you'll  1101(a)(43) is set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief  three subparagraphs  (j), (q), and (t)  refer to the sentence that may be imposed for a violation. well, when you're talking about a state conviction, that's clearly referring to the sentence that may be imposed under state law for a conviction. four other subparagraphs  (f), (g), (r), and (s)  turn on the sentence that was actually imposed. that means that  in the case of a official state crime, as we have here, that state law has to authorize the sentence, and that the state court, applying state sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime of  for  of at least 1 year. so, it is  it is infused in section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look to the consequences of an offense under state law.
so either definition could comply with the statute?
well, timbers cited, as the chief justice indicates, the interest section in 506. that's all it's about. i don't  i think timbers is misleading on this point.
your honor, i think it shows respect to the trial judge to require that the trial judge be required, in the first instance, to review this evidence that the trial judge saw, heard, and has the same opportunity, as this court has observed in cases going back over a century, to see, just like the jurors saw, and provides a perspective on it that is available to the trial judge, alone.
 it only goes uncontested if the only way you're going to contest it is to show diminished capacity. you could have contested this evidence by showing that, you know, he was a in a rock band, and he wanted to play the music for  to advertise the concert, not to lure the police. there are a lot of defenses you can present. what they're saying is, if it goes to diminished capacity, that has to be used to show insanity or not  - or nothing at all.
could we go back? because i'm still concerned with the fact that claim 1, which is a claim on january 2 that police arrested the defendant and didn't read him miranda warnings properly; claim 2 is a claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor, during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments. now, i think, just common sense, do those arise out of the same core operative facts? absolutely not. the facts are totally different. the only thing that brings them together is that there was a single legal proceeding. and, at the same time, if i adopt this approach that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, i'm running around congress' effort with the one-year statute. so what is your response?
what's your test, mr. shapiro?
the complaint  the  the intervention by the state claimed only a lien? is that what the 
that doesn't speak to the private right of 
i didn't hear the last part.
well, but does texas have a position in response to the president's determination?
the congress placed on school districts the obligation to identify disabled children within their jurisdiction.
here i think there was  why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? wasn't mr. cochran afraid of that  of that happening?
and i don't know that there is either, your honor. we'd be willing to concede that for purposes of this argument because even if there is, it doesn't apply here 
had rule 59 motions been made in those cases?
yes. the minuet may  may  will be most likely at a bench conference. in this case the two motions were discussed. one was discussed during a jury recess. the other was discussed the next morning before the jury was assembled. so it may be a minuet, but it's a  i'm not sure who the  there's a 1-minute waltz. so it is more like a 1-minute waltz than a full minuet.
requirements for labeling or packaging.
let me just ask you about the fobian, and i know justice breyer has a question. let's assume that you're correct in that the fees are allowable. can the bankruptcy court make the determination of the reasonableness of the fees?
if  your honor, if it was a crime, then, yes 
i've never heard of that.
is that true?
in this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. the first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title ix. that's cannon through congress, through sandoval, through  your opinion in sandoval acknowledges that cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. title ix is violated by retaliatory action against coach jackson. he's  and  and this is an important part of title ix because, particularly here, people like coach jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. they're not in the best position to know the budgets. it is people like coach jackson who make it work, and indeed, i think what is recognized about the  about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.
and one train that we didn't finish before. you were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000  that entire sum would be needed  would be necessary for the support of the debtors.
why is it that the sixth circuit rule requires the identification, for complete exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the first stage?
no, but in 
so, now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about. the parent hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get. now we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved person can go to court.
i'm sorry, your honor?
well, the question is  i mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a violation of section 1981, and the argument here is that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.
okay, i understand that. now, what specifically, since i think this is scientific, do i look at to verify what you just said, namely that a wet depression, even if there's no interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a dry depression wouldn't have? that's a scientific statement. where do i verify it?
i think the answer to the question, your honor, is that in order to follow the second circuit as you've described, this court would have to rewrite the interpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued in rose v. lundy. that's my belief because rose v. lundy  or the statute, as interpreted by rose v. lundy indicates that at a minimum, the unexhausted claims ought to be dismissed without prejudice and sent back for exhaustion in state court.
 to really undermine the regime.
well, the  the name is clearly not determinative. also, congress in the  in the 
i don't think that this is unusual, your honor. i think the court has to explain the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only does it have to do so in court, in front of the defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence that he is receiving 
 california 
ms. mahoney, let me ask you a question. am i wrong about this? it seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government. isn't that the way the statute reads?
who is  who is the tribe taxing? is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas? is that 
justice o'connor, we did raise the application of the severance clause below, although the court, both at the district court level and the first circuit appeared to look at the  the lack of a general health exception as a per se constitutional problem that rendered the statute as a whole invalid.
well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs. so i do think it's removed. i mean, this court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the seventh amendment extends to pleadings. and i don't think this is the case in which to take up that issue because i think it is quite clear that what at least we're asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the reform act is that you need to apply  that you simply follow matushita and monsanto, and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside. and if you take that particular approach, which clearly is consistent with the seventh amendment, then it seems to me you  the seventh that you followed under the constitution, is eliminated.
so that now the defendant will have the protection of his jury determining his guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm, all the bad things that will increase his sentence and might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the first place.
it's conceivable you could read it that way, although the eeoc has specified many times, in the quarter century since it enacted the regulation, that no, when we  and let me take us to the text to explain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue brief. they said  and this is the block quote. when an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on individuals. that's the reference to disparate impact. the regulatory materials cite to griggs. but in all events, i do want to come back to the bottom line, and that is the eeoc recognizes, we recognize that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the burden on the plaintiff's case. it's a  you have a higher hurdle 
that's 
did  did any judge say that, any judge on the sixth circuit say that that was the ohio law?
there were other documents. he said there were other documents and the district court said sorry, you came up with that too late, i'm not going to look at the other documents.
your honor, the time that those words were used, the common law, and we respectfully disagree with the solicitor general's office on the reading of warner, we'd urge the court to read that. the reason the court allowed the use of the term in that case is because they quite clearly said it did not have a secondary meaning. there is no trademark protection for descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in complete agreement with that. we're dealing with the secondary meaning.
that's not this case, your honor. that's not this case. we say that the underwriters made a horizontal conspiracy to inflate the prices and to inflate their charges as a result by requiring these laddering orders and jointly negotiating together the amounts of the laddering.
they've articulated that as an abstract principle that has no application on the facts of this case, because on the 
in this case it's the statute that was violated, but you are correct, justice souter 
well  well, even 
and you think that's invalid?
right. what are the instances in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some other statutory 
right. and in  in your argument, in your answer to the chief justice, you were pointing out a situation in which taking away the tv didn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.
yes, your honor.
yes.
adverse.
i know, but without getting to that point, it sounds as though the district court simply made a mistake, just forgot i suppose, the evidence that the witness didn't wait at all.
no, that's  official
well  but that is circular reasoning, because the whole  your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are  the numbers are so few  the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. if there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than filburn's use, non-economic.
but if we say that a likelihood  or that the  or substantial probability that the evidence will be destroyed allows the no-knock, why won't that be true in every drug case, other than for what we said in richards?
did they leave a notice?
i  i  not much, your honor. (laughter.)
but that  in  in the retrospective view that the court looked at in  in the  the casey decision, it went back and it traced the origin of a number of  of statutes and looked essentially to similar language, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of  of costs.
well, it might have been that 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't go down a public street without  so  and so 
i didn't understand the definiteness doctrine. i mean, all these things in 1854 i guess weren't so clear. but i think the precise claim in samuel morse's case was the use of the motive power of the electric current for making or printing intelligible characters. that sounds absolutely definite. anyone can understand it. i thought the problem there was that although anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad as that. you must intend to claim something narrower. and insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise. so insofar as it's broad, it's too broad, but definite. and insofar as it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite. okay? precisely the claim that they raised before the federal circuit and precisely the claim  with appropriate citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the federal circuit said nothing.
absolutely, your honor. one of the  one of the evils of the presumption is that there's nothing that says that the patent has to be on the entire product. the  the patent could be on a component of a product. and in today's world, as your honor says, television sets, cd devices, cell phones, all of those devices are loaded with components, one of which may happen to be patented. it may not be the one that makes the  it may not have to do with anything that makes that product attractive in the marketplace, but the presence of that patent would be relied upon to make the presumption applicable.
that's right.
what about in yosemite? i think there's a river down there too. is the river in yosemite owned by california or by the  the feds?
can i ask you a basic question 
then  then you have to get beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living trust.
it is the correct way to understand the 
all right, then he 
you 
no, but the burden-of-proof issue, as you've just answered my question, does not arise until the fourth circuit finds that lincoln is a nominal party. and if, in fact, that conclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of-proof issue that has  or no burden of proof that has not been satisfied.
well, actually at  at joint appendix number 183, officer allegra, who was one of the entry team, said it was pouring. so  and in fact, the stipulation of facts said it was heavy. so iris mena was being  was being demure when she talked about that. you can even see the rain on the videotape. and so they took her outside. they took all of them outside. they put them in this little room, which is not connected to the house. they had one or two armed officers outside. there was no place for them to go. they couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the search because they were in this room. they couldn't flee because there's only one way out, a door. there were two armed guards there. and  and if all they had to do was sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed that they had any connection to mr. romero, who had already been arrested at his mom's house 
you are  you are 
well, because 
there are several factors in that 8 regard, your honor. as to the argument itself, the 9 prosecutor called mr. rompilla a very strong individual, a 10 very violent individual. he asked the jury, isn't it 11 frightening the similarity between his past crime and this 12 crime? he sent the clear signal to the 
i understand.
what you need to look at is whether an objective person in the suspect's position would understand that questioning was going to cease, and there was  would be no more questioning. edwards 
of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me. but why haven't they gone out and got? so why  what you're pointing to so far is that congress has said a particular class of people get the attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the security will support it. it doesn't say a word about what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, where so provided by contract. colliers says they can get it.
let me give you two examples 
the question, however, though, is not whether they were trying to change that consequence. the question is whether they did so retroactively, because this court presumes that if congress is trying to change the consequences of an action that has occurred in the past in substantive ways, congress should say so explicitly, because, as your  you have said in previous decisions, it is a foundational principle of western law that primary  the consequences of primary conduct are judged as 
so you too then have to go, unless you can find a present policy to discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 years?
 of the party.
you don't  you don't have to engage in our dispute here. (laughter.)
not in rust, but in the court's subsequent cases, rosenberger, southworth  in particular, in velazquez  this court said that rust has come to be understood by the court as a government speech case, because the government prescribed the message, and it's government speech whether or not the government speaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the message.
brower versus county of inyo says 
do you agree that a state could adopt water quality standards that would, in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the state?
oh, i see. i'm sorry, you're right. yeah.
no, i take 
only in the sense that it would require the state to prove more than it had to prove for the elements of the crime.
what would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case? is there anything other than was it  was this interest usurious? the dispute between the parties  we're not told what the issues are that would be subject to arbitration.
of course they can't do it, but the justification is not that there is something bad about this particular individual or he's in some kind of limbo. the reason is that there's a policy tending towards release, which california has decided they want to introduce this as a condition. now 
if  if there are some factors that favor putting him in shackles and i guess others might not, what's the argument that the judge shouldn't at least have to make a finding?
they do count. but it ties into 25 the response  the second part of justice scalia's 1 question is, isn't finality served? isn't that what aedpa 2 is all about? we don't believe that the government's rule 3 that they propose will serve finality in the vast majority 4 of cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're 5 talking about claims that will have no merit in state 6 court. but because it's very difficult to complete the 7 state court habeas process before the 1 year in the first 8 paragraph, these petitioners will file placeholder 9 petitions in federal court and have them held while they 10 finish their state court review. so what you're doing is 11 you're talking about these six states, maybe 10 guys a 12 year, you're going to cause, as the brackett court on 13 remand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be 14 filed, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases 15 so that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who 16 happen to be in these states.
 i don't understand your last  your last answer. you think bopping somebody on the head in the course of delivering a package would 
under the act, it talks about the issue of discharge. that is the  that is the matter that is being regulated by the statute, an actual discharge into the navigable body of water. if you have an hydrologically isolated body of water, you cannot physically have a discharge into the navigable stream. it is an impossibility. and therefore, the act does not allow the speculation that the court is referring to here.
and if that's what percentile refers to, i just want to know what those things are that are being distributed. and - and that's where i find the ambiguity. and if there is an ambiguity, i guess we are going to take the view of the agency at least as i understand it. so  so that's why i asked the question.
i think it's much more speculative in the  in the fifth-amendment area, but i think 
there's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. but what i am suggesting is in  is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. for example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the internet, the only way to get that posting off the internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. and if it's  even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to  to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. there are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.
thank you. the case is submitted.
well, but  i mean, all you've got to do is 
they were allowed into the country under the parole statute that i just read, which makes  which makes it clear that they are admitted not  not in a way that confers any rights on them, but they are admitted in the interest of the united states for public benefits under circumstances which make clear that it is not an admission and that 
thank you, mr. porter. mr. chan, you have four minutes remaining.
that is a very difficult question, your honor, and i would 
you're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be. if there were a difference, i'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.
all right. well, then  then to get to the main point here, if we are going to get to that, the question that i would have for you is  is the following. if we accept your interpretation, it's pretty anomalous. i mean, someone who brings his bivens action first, of course, can sue the individual employee, and you agree to that. but if he brings his bivens action second, because he made a mistake and went into the wrong court or he brought the wrong action or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he didn't know how it would end up, that person is out of luck. now, there's nothing in this statute that says that the government  that the congress wanted to achieve that result. what order you bring the suit in shouldn't really make any difference here. the bivens action is totally different from all the other tort actions in that respect, and it's listed separately in 2679 to make clear that it isn't  it is different. so why? i mean, why read it your way? the burden that reading it their way would impose on the government is minuscule. the number of such suits is tiny, i would imagine. all right. now, what is wrong with my question?
theoretically. (laughter.)
no. we don't  you agree with 25 that or not?
if the mandate hadn't been issued, then i think no matter how the court decides this case, that depending on the circumstances, the court of appeals might be able to alert this court to a  a change in the facts that might lead this court to dismiss the petition as improvidently granted. these are not things that happen all the time. they are things that sometimes happened. and i did want to get back to the final reason i think that the state was not the victim of unfair surprise in this case, and that is there was a federal court stay of execution in this case. the state was perfectly well aware of the importance of securing a final judgment in the court of appeals before returning to state court. and as this court held in calderon, this court rejected the state's view that a federal habeas appeal is final when cert is denied. that was the view of the state of california in that case. this court instead specifically tied the state's interest in finality to issuance of the appellate court mandate. that's consistent with the unbroken history, we think, of drawing a sharp distinction between the moment at which the court of appeals relinquishes jurisdiction over a case and permitting the court to correct errors before then. in fact, this court also in calderon specifically noted that it was not a case where the mandate had been stayed pursuant to a (d)(1) motion. there is no reason to distinguish a case involving the non-issuance of a mandate under rule 41(b) from a case involving a stay of the mandate under rule (d)(1). those are both circumstances in which the court of appeals still has the case, and if the court of appeals still has the case and recognizes a clear error in its prior decision or wishes to apply a new precedent to its decision or discovers that new evidence bears on a question, it has wide discretion to reconsider that judgment before relinquishing jurisdiction over the case.
but you agree  you  in answer to justice breyer's question, he mentioned a drug that was a schedule 1 drug, morphine. or maybe 
i think within the  within the meaning of the confrontation clause, if those statements are allowed at proof  as proof at trial without the person coming in, then what we have essentially done is created a system by which people can create evidence for use by the legal system, by engaging those statements without coming into court. that's  that's right. and so i think one of the critical factors here is to imagine what happens if statements, such as the ones in  in this case, are admitted  are admissible, and this court holds  holds that they are, then basically they always can be admitted. then any state is free to create a system in which a statement to a responding officer comes in as proof. there's no need for the  for the  the declarant to show up at trial, and there's no doubt that  that that is what would happen. california and oregon have already adopted such statutes, and  and my state of michigan is on the verge of doing so.
but is it  is it defended by anything other than political motivation?
 that would be 
yes, you may. mr. feldman.
the whole point of the case is the  is twofold. each transaction is one in which there is a purchase if, and only if, there is already a contract for resale, so that when there is an offer compared to a purchase, you don't have two purchases. and when you've already got the contract for resale 
what else happens is that
ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of sherman act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up. now, you have to know that or you'd cut them. and that's called conscious parallelism. and i had always thought that this court had not said that that in and of itself is a violation of the sherman act.
 whether 
could  could we hear your argument on  on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point? what  on what ground do you say the united states has waived its  its immunity from suit in this case?
well, we asked for judgment, in our favor on their claim, that our current activities constituted a basis for secondary liability. i'm not sure if word "dismiss" was 
well 
yes.
and therefore was unlawful.
 unless it's registered.
my hypo is at the guilt stage, not the sentencing stage.
are you entitled to consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as the subsidiary brush strokes that are? in justice alito's example, if the pleadings don't point out that the library of congress and the capitol are also up on this hill, is the judge at the motions stage entitled to consider that?
assuming we only look at the public information at the time the complaint is filed.
it  it could be a clerical error, mr. chief justice, and we  we think that's exactly why the advisory committee note  notes indicate that an attorney who believes that a mandate should have issued should confirm that he or she has secured a final judgment before assuming that the court of appeals jurisdiction over a case is completed. that didn't happen in this case.
well, under section 5, the state went ahead and created district 25 as the offset because it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had been dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going to be able to be used for section 5 purposes. similarly, under section 2, the state saw that it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to make an offset district which caused its own problems. so the use of race here to achieve the 50.9 percent voting age majority was not to satisfy the voting rights act, either section 5 or section 2.
mr. smiland, do you mind telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the court of federal claims?
i understand.
could you  could you clarify one thing for me? i just want to be sure i have it in mind correctly. is it correct that the firearm has to be an operable firearm?
your honor, if the questioning itself results in the views that are the basis of the strike, that would present a problem. that is not the case here, however, where the  the disparate questioning on minimum sentencing, for instance, was based on the views that were expressed.
a determination of no discharge had been entered. however, it was an asset case, so it remains open, it remains open at this point, until the chapter 7 trustee makes a distribution to creditors or files his final report with the court. it has not been dismissed.
yes.
i think it may be 
i assume it's  i assume it's sort of a  a case-by-case inquiry. in other words, the county could be an arm of the state for some purposes but not others.
because 
it had  it could bring the  a suit for the damages of the lost revenue that it could have gotten from its contract. we believe, looking at state law, because we think it is a matter of state law, that here jwm would get its net profits. the wages that would be paid out would be recoverable by john mcdonald. different states may look at this differently, but that really wasn't the issue that this case had been 
well, has ferc said that this is a problem, that the states are interfering?
that was lafave. you cited lafave in your brief for that proposition.
thank you, mr. connelly. the case is submitted.
not under 502(a)(3), but certainly under other principles. equitable principles of subrogation, as mamsi repeatedly describes in their brief, is a doctrine that is governed by equity. it's created wholly apart of a contract. and we cite numerous cases for the proposition that you can limit by contract 
right, but my answer to that, your honor, would be that if it's a lie, meaning if they did get damages for medical expenses, you couldn't overcome it merely by saying you didn't seek them. and if it's true, meaning in the  in the tort action the plaintiff didn't actually seek those damages, then there would be an equitable theory called impairment of a subrogation right that could be asserted. but this is significant. this isn't  this isn't historical minutia. this is significant because it goes to the heart of whether the claim is equitable or really just a dressed-up claim to say, hey, you breached this contract provision because when you define in the contract  and this goes to your jurisdictional question, justice souter. when you define in the contract the very contours of reimbursement, all you're doing is mandating contract damages. and here, it's worse than that. mamsi expressly disclaimed the make-whole doctrine. they did it in the plan. they  in their motion for preliminary injunction, they cited in re paris, which is a fourth circuit case that governs, and you can do that. and even before this court, they have  their footnotes 19 and 20 of their  of their brief  they're not  they're continuing to rely on their ability to do that in their contract.
yes. it's essentially the same case kind of case in each instance. although the jury has to find intentional discrimination in the title vii case; under the equal pay act the jury has to determine whether the employer has shown that the present disparity is the result of some factor other than sex. and so in both cases, the jury always has to consider the basis of prior decisions that are the cause of the present disparity.
no, your honor. it would be precisely the same creature that happens every time congress makes a case removable on the basis of a federal defense. every time congress does that, which is not very often, the court has held that the colorable defense is sufficient to invest the federal court with jurisdiction.
yes, they're the kind of the  the ones i just gave you. in other words, if there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to  it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and limited group, but it's  they're  they aggressively try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious belief, that we should, in applying rfra, draw distinctions between the group you represent and that hypothetical group?
the result, i understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.
and  and then the  the other vehicles pay $100 for the  for the in-state fees, and so this seems to me that  that on  on its face shows that it's like a registration fee.
no, that doesn't work. i mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, you haven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it. i don't  i don't think "miscarriage" is redundant. but you  your construction of "negligent transmission" is so narrow that i'm not sure it adds anything to "miscarriage," which suggests it might 
what bearing does history have upon the definitional question of whether, when you sell a bundled offering of information technology and communications, you are selling communications?
i thought here there was evidence there was a pistol, but maybe i'm wrong.
no, that's certainly true, mr. chief justice. but congress knew, as we all know, that the practice of medicine evolves, that things change, that today's  acupuncture, the use of botox, things that were unheard of 30 years ago, are all accepted medical practices today, and they are all regulated by the states, not by the u.s. attorney general. and the question here is whether congress intended to enact a uniform medical practices 
that's part one.
and the judge says, you're both right. some people have excruciating pain, but there's been no alternative suggested. bottom line of that particular case would be?
that's not my understanding. the  it is not  the incidence  or the occasion for the payment of the tax isn't a sale to a retailer. you'd have  i can imagine the practicalities of that would drive everybody crazy. the distributor 
and he thought he didn't have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know? he's being picked on for drug testing all the time.
well, the  again, there are lots of situations where there are two purchasers. again, you go back to the  to the four specific transactions that were identified. for the 102 sales, 55 percent of the sales between 1996 and 2000 involve  i mean, 1998  involved direct-comparison sales, where we purchased from volvo, and one of our competitors 200 miles down the road  and on interstate highways, 200 miles down the road's the same as next door  and we  we purchased exactly the same product, and we got a significantly lower concession 
mr. minear, you know, i  i am just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible mess of a statute. i can't figure out what it means.
yes, but 
yes, justice scalia.
well, justice 
but in this case, you're  but mr. olson said the component is either the disk or the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded instructions are transferred.
now, erisa  erisa makes it very clear that  that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and  and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan.
that  that was part of justice alito's question, and i think there are two different senses in which a statutory list could be considered exclusive or comprehensive. that is, one would be legal exclusivity. for instance, the definition of racketeering activity says racketeering activity means acts indictable under the following statutes. that definition is legally exclusive in the sense that if  if congress enacted a new statute and it prohibited conduct that was classic mob activity, but it wasn't on the list of rico predicates, we would say that's out, it's not racketeering within the meaning of the statute even though it would be racketeering activity within a common understanding. i think with the definition of attorney general, what we have is a different sort of comprehensiveness. that is, it may well be that the definition of attorney general is comprehensive in the sense of actually listing all the people who could otherwise plausibly be regarded as standing in the shoes of the attorney general. it may be that congress, when it promulgated the list, got everything that would have been covered anyway. it's not legally comprehensive or legally exclusive in the sense of directing courts that even an official who would otherwise be regarded as an appropriate surrogate for the attorney general is not to be so regarded if he's off  off the list.
that's exactly right, justice scalia.
your honor, that has not occurred in reality. there have been several inmates that have moved from admission to level 5.
that's right. that's what i conceded to justice souter earlier.
i don't believe you are bound by that, your honor. for example 
no, that's 
if  two  two responses, if i may, your honor. and that is, if you  if that is the conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this case because there are an awful number of claims that are precisely those kinds of claims that the fifth circuit would not allow. secondly, i think you're wrong with regard to the scope of the clear statement requirement. there is no requirement that you have to have a clear statement to apply a u.s. law to a foreign vessel. there is only a requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that vessel. and here you're dealing with public accommodation 
our components of the foreign manufactured computers. those components are not supplied from 
well, not necessarily. you could interpret located to include principal place of business. this issue doesn't arise in this case because what  what you have to decide is whether the fact that the bank has a branch in south carolina means they're located in south carolina. south carolina is not wachovia's principal place of business or 
no. if  if they had said, look, the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief indicates, it's not a 
i don't know, i mean 
thank you, general kline. the case is submitted.
the district court's entry of summary judgment must be reversed, the ninth circuit did that because of its total disregard for likely to confusion 
all right. so, you're not making a 
so he does get the report.
i'm getting there. i'm not arguing with you. i'm getting there. then you think that whoever it is that they are the front for has  is a virginia resident. is that what you think?
 important exception. the exception which comes from silverthorne is when there is an independent chain of events such that it will be  not could be, but would be  in fact, discovered anyway, despite the unlawfulness  silverthorne  holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then because that's not going to impact deterrence. now, that's segura. that's silverthorne. that's case after case. of course, i accept that. and if you can show that this case somehow fits within that chain, fine. then i  then i maybe appear i have my mind made up on this, but i'm open to change.
right. if not visible, then that would be fine.
 that correct?
what the district court did is it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury verdict.
but congress could reasonably determine, under this statute, that there are  that there are  that beef has many things in common, that it is a generic problem  or generic food or generic commodity, and the industry 
and that's why 
 kennedy 
may i just ask your point on that? you are giving  your main argument is there are good reasons to retain this presumption. but then you said even if there aren't, leave it to congress. the court created this rule, the market power rule, not congress. why, when we're dealing with a court-created rule, should we say, well, the court has had it in play for 60 years, so it's the legislature's job to fix it up, instead of the court correcting its own erroneous way?
the 
notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. the  the point i'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. and whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming mr. cochran until he was paid money. we attempted to achieve that. we thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and i agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. but we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly i agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give mr. tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame mr. cochran. he  and  and this is  one point that i want to stress. we don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on tv, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. we don't view those as public forums under the definition that this court has provided. those are not public forums. we are not concerned about that. we do not believe that those events will occur. we did not seek to protect them. so we have given mr. tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. and with that, i would submit that while the injunction is broad, i don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this court believes it is overbroad, i believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. thank you.
your honor, i believe the most  the most important difference in the review of this court the last time and the review of this  of the court this time is that the court did take a big-picture look at all of the pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of appeals did and as this  as this court must do now, it must go, as justice scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the jurors who were challenged. miller-el 
i don't know one lunch from another often, but the  the eeoc might and  and so might a judge who hears evidence.
no, your honor, i wouldn't say that. in his sixth circuit briefs, he does  in a section that's entitled i hereby challenge my conviction, he does also note in that section that he's got some concerns about his sentencing hearing. so i don't know that he's waived that. but i don't believe that there's a valid due process claim that he has with regard to either his conviction or his sentence.
we do and that's the point. even more importantly, the reasonable observer knows what 
and may i ask you a question about the california statute, if i may, please? in subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact "shall" take into account any of the following factors, if relevant. and one of those is the existence of any special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1. and under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is number 14, "heinous, atrocious, or cruel." does that mean the statute required in the weighing process  that the jury take into account that factor? and is it not true that factor was held invalid?
page 77a as you said. but what is your argument there? i mean, that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the secretary's reinterpretation of.
and in  and in munsingwear, your honor, the united states cited that precise provision of the restatement of judgments to this court, and six justices of this court held, no, if there's no appeal, we are still going to give this judgment collateral estoppel effect. certainly a state court would not be unreasonable in following this court's lead, since this court has never retreated from that statement.
do you think the california rule is the same as the federal rule?
all right. no, i'm not saying that. i  look, until this minute, you might have been equivocal. you're quite right, i was leading you. [laughter.]
there  there is a  you say there  there are what? nine different manslaughter, did you say?
thank you, mr. phillips. ms. hart, you have 5  5 minutes.
should. now, you're not  how far are you prepared to go? you can't go more than your brief and your facts justify. are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park?
our defense on the merits to this claim, were we to get there, is that the government has paid the same doctor $17,500 three times for the same service, and that denise finn should not be required to reimburse blue cross blue shield when they have incompetently, in effect, paid out more money than they should have. the second defense involves the fact that some of the benefits which blue cross blue shield is seeking reimbursement for are not connected to the accident that injured mr. mcveigh. they're part of his normal health care type of services which wouldn't fall under the reimbursement claim. those claims are  are not the type of things that i think that the federal district courts want to deal with. this case 
well, to prevail, do you think you have to show that, under prong two of m'naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact, did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he seeks to prove under prong one? if it's  do you have to convince us of that in order to win?
he was. and judge weis, even in his own opinion, acknowledges that his subcommittee that wrote the language intended to overrule zahn. and so what he says is 
well, but it doesn't matter. it would still be a report of the tax court if you don't take that language literally. if you say any report coming out of the institution is a report of the tax court, you would have to make public the reports of the individual tax court judges, which is not done.
i thought your position was that aggravation must be reasonable. what the court in black indicates is that it is not going to consider anything reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless there's a finding of fact to support it. is that the position you take?
what is your position on what fees we're talking about. do you agree with your friend that money that's spent, that's going to have to be spent anyway in the state court proceeding, though, is not wasted, that that's not recoverable?
yes, i think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.
 "felony punishable under the controlled" 
 it's not mail-specific, because all delivery people have the same problem.
you mean 
well, then i'm probably wrong. [laughter.]
it's just a background question. i'm curious, was asarco sued here, or  and is its liability capped by workmen's comp laws, or?
perhaps, but not in this particular case because what the jury weighed in wesley was not only eastman's testimony, they weighed the fact that stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to death. that's a  i mean, that's going to lead to  i  i  maybe i'm off base here, but that's going to lead a jury to come out in a conclusion to find wesley the aider and abetter and not 
well, i think 
thank you, general. the case is submitted.
and in those cases, your honor, the courts also  appellate courts were undoubtedly exercising jurisdiction in those cases. and in eisenberg, for example, it was a request to recall the remittitur. it took months for the california supreme court to decide that case. and they said yes, there's a standard where you can do that there  the court. we find you don't make it, so we don't have jurisdiction. they came to this court and said out of time. you had to have sought our review timely, from the final judgment of the california supreme court, you could not wait for that period of time in which the california supreme court decided to not have jurisdiction.
well, i would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.
i'm not sure if they answer that precise question, but 
empire, et cetera. but aside from that, why is it different?
 the university 
now, that is not the test in an ordinary tort case in california, is it?
your honor, if the petitioner is not capable of going back to litigate the state claim, the claim is not unexhausted by definition. and 
but as i read your brief, you didn't really confront the question, s i understand it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a judgment at all. and i'm interested in what your position on that is.
well, perhaps 
no, no, no. it says, "who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle." i mean, he is  he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory.
it was, indeed, your honor.
okay. so we are not talking about anyone being born and living. they are not going to.
and it's no under our 
and that theory, which is the problem for your side of the case  that theory has all kinds of implications. i go out and i help the painter paint my office. we have a joint venture. i  so there's no problem. i don't take it in  you know, i get a  this is great. and so that i think, if i'm right, was the thrust of justice kennedy's question.
no. congress just wiped out labeling and only those labeling requirements 
there is a different matter. but as a matter of article iii jurisdiction, your honor, the  the mootness doctrine does not apply to a situation where you have a judgment and it doesn't necessarily apply the moment you get paid.
well, mr. dreeben, do you agree with his characterization that all the courts of appeals go the other way?
 word was "discharge." the reason we held it was not covered is not because there was no pollutant. it was clear that there was a pollutant. but we held there was no discharge.
well, i think it was raised, your honor. the validity issue was raised in the district court, it was raised on appeal. the district court had construed the patent as requiring  and part of the district court's claim construction addressed the issue as to whether or not one could patent a law of nature or effectively patent a scientific idea. the district court said this patent must require something more, and that is at joint appendix page 60. it must require something more than simple existence of the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiencies. and one of the places that the federal circuit did get it wrong, your honor, was in abandoning that limitation that the district court had imposed on the patent.
no. with all respect, your honor, that's the language that  that the separability rule in prima paint has been used to apply to. the first part of section 2 says this is how you create an arbitration provision. you have an enforceable provision if it's in a contract, but there is an exception for general state contract laws that provide defenses to a contract.
that is precisely the argument that we are making, your honor.
well 
 this  this court is a court of review, and to take a question that was never certified, even to the court of appeals, to have this court address it seems to me very strange. it seems to me to erode rather starkly the final judgment rule, which we don't have here.
mr. kester, would it 
 case.
suppose 
absolutely.
 think, mr. clement, the 200 years have approved of his adding additional crimes under the law of war. i mean, he has never  i don't think we have ever held that the president can make something a crime which was not already a crime under the law of war.
 separate tax in ohio, and we're going to double it, though, if your next investment is in some 
if you succeed you're going to get an order from this court to the state court say, saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been begun, and do it right. so the focus of it is still the state proceeding even though we may correct it under appellate jurisdiction.
i assume it's a benefit to consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased because of higher prices being paid for those needed goods, and i assume when a higher price is paid, more of those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit consumers who want those goods.
well, richards precluded a general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing in a specific case, and it's the fact that the prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you do not argue that is  is what i don't understand.
i thought  maybe i  i misunderstood you, but i thought that one of your points were even assuming that we couldn't send these people back into cuba without having a major conflagration, the rogue dictator is not going to be deterred by our tossing even into the sea the people that he doesn't want.
thank you, mr. baggot.
well, i'm  i'm assuming  and correct me if i'm wrong about this  that the bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion. it doesn't become a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the district court.
i think the language of the statute says that it's protecting the  the right of all  the same right to make and enforce 
 claimed would occur.
this court in williamson county said that before you could bring a federal takings claim, you had to go to state court and seek compensation under state law.
mr. frederick, this is  this is what concerns me about your answer. i know that mr. goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to  what percentage of its passengers are from the usa?
 whichever  for 924  whichever one would make it a felony.
thank you, ms. smith. the case is submitted.
we 
in terms of a trial strategy, your honor?
i take it from your presentation you think we do have to go through the teague analysis. we can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?
that's  that's  your honor, that's our position that  concurrent jurisdiction is a separate issue from the appellate review issue that rooker-feldman raises. justice breyer, the answer to your hypothetical is that appellate review is something different from having a parallel action. appellate review is probably best defined by two characteristics that i'll try to flesh out for you. the first is that the proponent alleges some sort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating, or otherwise nullifying that lower court order. when a party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the trial court, the most that can really be said is that you are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you are seeking appellate review. you do not have what looks like appellate review. you're not alleging errors by the lower court. you're not seeking an order that directly nullifies or otherwise undoes the state court judgment.
well, all the criteria are there, but failure to exhaust is not.
if we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second  a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?
did that  did that involve the employee or it was just legal argument involving lawyers representing the united states?
i mean, maybe this provision represents the judgment of the agency that griggs applies to this other statute, and  and i'm not sure that we owe chevron deference to that determination.
yes.
respectfully, no, your honor. and the reason why is 
i dispute that the court could do it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
why  why do you say mail fraud does  does not have with it the normal common law fraud requirement of reliance?
what the jury  perhaps i'm not understanding your point.
okay.
well, the policy  i thought the assumption was that the policy was in fact a policy which, which was sort of currently honored and intended to be honored by the company, whereas the case that we're concerned about is the case in which there was a discriminatory act, you know, 5, 10, 15 years ago. nobody remembers the discrimination now. it's just that it continues to have these ripple effect consequences. i would have thought that the subsequent explanation in bazemore would have been inconsistent with your position with respect to the current ripple effect.
 alito's thought, supposing there were no restrictions whatsoever, but this particular search didn't seem very offensive. would you still defend it?
that's correct. it  it's discretionary, and that's clear not just  not just from analysis of the  of the michigan courts' opinions, but from the provision of the  of  but from the constitutional provision that  that created this entire controversy, which was added in 1994. it's article i, section 20. and that constitutional provision itself draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and appeals by leave of court. so even if the michigan courts wanted to have a system of  of mandatory appeals, they're now precluded by the michigan constitution from doing that. and so  and so clearly, if this court adheres to the sharp distinction and  which i think is equally sharp and clear, that this court has made between  between appeals of right and discretionary appeals 
yes, certainly.
no.
yes, your  yes, your honor, because there's the  that's the second step of the analysis. the first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. if you don't  if the court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. but then if the court adopts 
exactly. because they had 23 conducted an objectively reasonable investigation into 24 anything else that might be in that file.
not necessarily, your honor. not necessarily. the debtor could move to another jurisdiction.
well, why isn't that sovereign interest in not taxing?
thank you, mr. lovell. mr. shapiro, you have four minutes remaining. statement of stephen m. shapiro on behalf of the petitioners
and the executive couldn't weigh that. you say, categorically, it  there's no  -
congress does have the power to deal with it. and at the end of the court's opinion in oneida ii, the court expressed confidence that, up to this point, has not been borne out, that congress would fix the problem.
no, it doesn't.
so that was in, in brewer. now 
he joined a public crowd on a private side  public sidewalk in front of private homes. the crowd happened to have some other students in that school there.
no. the state has  and the medicaid statute is quite clear. they have an entitlement to payments for medical care, but 
in  in your view, is the plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of- pocket losses?
 or manner.
well, let me ask you 
well, it  all those statements say  and there are advertisements in the record that say that the advertising is funded by america's beef producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they 
the regulation gives this example, which i think is on point, and that is, if you are told to show up for when the production begins  the meat's going to come across  and the machine breaks down or they simply don't start sending the meat until five minutes later, the fact is that you get compensated, because you're supposed to be there. the fact that they tell you, "be there for the" 
that's right.
all right. but that's  that's not in the  that's not in the text of this statute, is it?
yes, which gives and takes away.
if your position is all the economists say this is a lot of nonsense, i think maybe it's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in the tying product is what i'm suggesting.
well, then we have to have some per se rules.
yes.
no, your honor, there are 
thank you, mr. frederick. mr. roddy.
and all the circuits have just been wrong in their interpretation.
let's take specifically the words of the injunction. it's against orally uttering statements about cochran, just orally uttering statements about cochran.
it does not at all. it's  it's self-contained. and do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?
 whether in fact the section 112 determination, as made by the federal court, excludes all other possible use of this natural phenomenon. since i don't know that for sure, why shouldn't i tell the federal circuit, you know, your definition of correlate raises this issue and you should resolve whether it is true that there is no other possible usefulness for this, no substantial usefulness?
do you think congress really wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling concepts in these provisions?
i 
but they  let me stop you on that "real party," because, as has been pointed out, the "real party in interest" concept, as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be brought in the name of the real party so that the defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one day by plaintiff a, and is not home free when plaintiff b comes in with the identical complaint. so, it was originally designed with, who is the proper party, the assignee or the assignor? that's what real party  that's what the concept is familiarly about. who is the proper plaintiff, not defendant?
your honor, as to juror billy jean fields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty in general, but he did state that it was his belief that no one  no one  no matter their background or what they've done, is beyond rehabilitation. everyone can be rehabilitated. and this was a view regarding rehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed. it was a unique view, and in this case where jurors are asked to  to  the question, is this person going to be a continuing threat to society, is  is something that's going to go into their punishment inquiry. and if this person is one who the prosecutor believed could tend  if there's a repentant criminal defendant on the stand who testifies, that they would tend to believe that person and answer the question no. and  and again, this was not the only basis for the state's strike as well. the fact that his brother had been prosecuted in dallas county numerous times, the same prosecuting authority, contemporaneous with the trial, numerous occasions, had served time, and contrary to miller-el's assertions, the state did question mr. fields on this issue during voir dire, and it was a basis for the strike. there 
could you explain to me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem? you said this is an action by the administrator?
justice o'connor, that's 
well, then in that case, i suppose i should agree. my apologies. but what they did was to agree to remove, and in fact, that's what happened. if you look at what transpired immediately following the treaty, by 1846, all but 350 acres, down from 5,000, have been sold by the oneidas and very few remain. by 1920, there are only 32 acres. and the u.s.'s activities in the area also confirm that that was the understanding of the treaty, that it terminated sovereignty. there are some very sparse references in the records to some exercise of jurisdiction by the u.s. starting around the turn of the century, around the early 1900s, but those only relate to the 32 acres that remained occupied by the oneidas. there is no indication of any exercise of u.s. jurisdiction over the remaining 295,000 acres.
right.
is this an alternative argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two, or is this complementary to the argument that the evidence comes in under prong two?
well, your honor, again, i think that, at a minimum  even if you grant that there may  the prisoner may see some advantage in that, there is, at a minimum, a substantially smaller incentive than you would  than you would have in, for example, a habeas case. but i want to get to the second thing, which is, i think, the more likely incentive that existed before the plra. before the plra is passed, if a prisoner wants to get to federal court as quickly as possible, the prisoner, the day after he suffers whatever injury he feels he has suffered, can go about filing his federal claim. the plra, with or without a procedural default rule, prevents that. he can't do that, because, first of all, he has to wait until  if he's going to avoid the grievance system for some reason, he has to wait until that time has run. but he then can't just go and file in federal court. if he just files in federal court, he's going to get bounced back, because he still has a potential remedy in the grievance system that he hasn't filed. the united states says that we've conceded that in systems where there isn't some sort of discretion that's clear to consider a late claim, that, in that case, the prisoner is not going to have to file. we do not concede that at all. i don't  you can look at our brief, at page 43  i don't think we concede that. we do refer to the fact that california and many other states provide for discretion. but the fact is that, in any event, we're not talking, here, about  with  in  with grievance time limits, we're not talking about something like a notice-of-appeal requirement that's jurisdictional, that's going to bar it from being appealed. if  there's always a possibility, particularly since many of these systems are internal rules of the grievance system, that, one way or another, it can be considered. and i think 
and there is a reindictment.
that's fine. as long as you accept that the first class is a distinct one, and, as far as i'm concerned 
we think that the better way to analyze this is that in fact there was no transfer of the underlying cause of action, and so we think that  that we  that gets into a very complicated area as to how you value the attorney's fees at the time.
no, your honor. there are two different things. i mean, one  one part of it is that here his  he doesn't say that his contract wasn't performed, but he also would have to show that domino's was the direct cause of his loss. and the common law, under section 766, for instance, says, look, if a  if a third party or if the defendant just made it more difficult for your employer to perform or for your company to meet its obligations, its contractual obligations, by causing it to have less money, that doesn't count. that's not inducing a breach.
well 
justice kennedy, as i read the holding in united states vs. williams, the court found that there was an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity in section 1346. and observed afterwards that a person like mrs. williams did not have a meaningful remedy. i did not read that to be  that the construction of the statute was driven by the equities. it was an observation after the fact.
it was. yes, yes. no, it was. it was adopted for witnesses under ten. this child actually was quite articulate in the preliminary hearing and was able  was able to talk about the fact that she remembered talking to the police officer, that she remembered  but then, but then in terms of trying to recall the incident, she was unable to recall the incident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the same detail that the police officer testified to. so it wasn't  you know, it wasn't a circumstance in which you had a child who simply couldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had occurred.
but following 
frankly, your honor, other than rfra, it's the only time congress has gone this far. and so to say that there's a lack of case law on this is more to suggest that there's been settled understandings that we can't go this far rather than 
justice o'connor, i think  i will address the negligent testing and, of course, the design defect 
it's true, justice souter, there are a lot of possible clear lines. what i'm describing to you is why the difference between matlock and this case is one in kind, and that is that matlock, i think, reflects an administrable rule, and that is, if you do have permission from someone who has the authority to admit you, you don't have to go ask anybody else.
 market the exemption?
well, you can move, as a party to the case, to dismiss somebody who's sued for some reason, but that isn't what happened here.
how long had the  the detainee in, however you pronounce it, mezei lived in the united states?
just can i ask a technical question here?
no, justice ginsburg. we didn't. and  and 
yes.
 whole purpose. but could they do that?
thank you, mr. flaxman. ms. solomon.
well, what the sec says is that if the conduct is ordinary book building, communications about future transactions, at future prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed. it is perfectly permissible.
okay.
would you agree that if the  if somebody with property on each side wanted to build a dam  i'm sorry, wanted to build a bridge to connect his property, and he needed to put a post in the middle of the river to support the bridge, that there would be no discharge of water occasioned by putting the post in there?
if they were 
 will be the same.
all that establishes is simply that if the state were operating this bridge and if the state were on the hook for any judgments and if the state had control over the people who were making the decisions, that there might be an issue of state sovereign immunity.
well, they would have just said during the time of the application for state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it.
if  to answer the first hypothetical first, if that's a matter of conscience, absolutely 
you are correct that our view is that yes, the attorney general can certify in that case. the issue is really one along a continuum as i think your honor has recognized. of on, on the one extreme, one might say that the attorney general must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations as true. and, and i don't think that anybody here is arguing that.
we had asked for the records and had requested the records that would specify and any written procedures and protocol, as well as the records from  from prior executions. they fought that and prevailed in the trial court. and in the florida supreme court, we had also sought records from the medical examiner that does the autopsies on executed individuals, as well as various other officials we thought might have information. we were  we were given nothing and they objected to us receiving any records whatsoever.
that's correct.
and that's what section 77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b), is referring to. so the district court analyzed those factors and it came 
right. but we're talking about comparative negligence here, where there's negligence on both sides. and i just don't know how you say one party's 20 percent  contributed 20 percent to the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using different causation standards.
no, no.
no, your honor. every time 
but this is also a jurisdictional. they decided it on a jurisdictional ground. they decided that no coa lay, for the reason that they said. now, i guess, though we wouldn't necessarily have to, we could simply say they're either right on that or they're wrong on that. and if they're wrong on it, send it back, and then you can argue whether there are other grounds; in which case, they could go into waiver, they could go into whether "constitutional" means to embrace "treaty," and all those other interesting arguments that we could write law-review articles about that were not, in fact  they swirl around in this case, and you would not, in fact, be able to  you wouldn't, in fact, have to pronounce on them now, here, when they really haven't been thoroughly gone into, below.
i know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what i said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day. what have you is a ticket to conduct discovery. now, that's what's bothering the department of justice and so i'd like to know the answer to that problem.
no, your honor. i believe that the cca misunderstood the federal law of the relationship between penry i and penry ii. the failing in this case was a verdict form that made no mention of mitigating evidence. the nullification instruction was the state's flawed defense to that failing.
i couldn't either.
and your honor, that is how the court, lower courts in the third circuit, where the collinsgru rule prevails, that's how they apply it.
but let's get the 
i would suggest, your honor, that his speaking, his invocation of a particular code section is an objective manifestation of an essentially subjective process. and that's illustrated by imagining three stops on that road that night, three mr. alfords, exact same facts. in one, the officer is engaged in the process that he engaged in here. in the other two, the officer chooses in the first to say nothing, and in the third, to say  hold up the code book and say what you did is in here. everything in here applies to you, wise guy. now get in the car. in those two other circumstances, complete silence and the table of contents approach, we wouldn't be here. these officers would not have been in litigation for 4 years. that to me demonstrates that it is essentially subjective because it is driven not by the facts, what the defendant did, but by the nature of the police officer. is he clever? has he gone to law school at night?
well, but this is a good question, and what is your position? that the ship could engage in racial discrimination while in u.s. ports on the selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations while in u.s. ports and within the 3 
who are you kidding? i 20 mean, everybody knows that comes from the ten 21 commandments. and what that message says is that 22 these commands that are engraved on the human heart 23 come from god. why put it that way? you know, 24 instead of that, just quote the state statute against 25 murder. that's not what they're doing. they're saying these basic principles of human behavior that we're governed by come from god. and that message would be conveyed so long as you use the terminology of the ten commandments. that's what the ten commandments stand for.
well, how about the rule of lenity in the criminal statutes? if this thing is so confusing, how's the business person supposed to know what they can do? how's the lawyer supposed to know?
there is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a senator from california when there was a proposal on the table to make the fcc the federal review forum. and that was rejected, if i understand correctly, because there was a concern that municipalities would have to travel all the way to washington, d.c. to defend in the fcc's forum. and congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the cost of transporting their representative to d.c. well, that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that would be awarded.
well, i don't have an empirical answer to that question.
seeing the errors of their ways, i guess.
that may be  that may be a very difficult question to answer, and maybe the respondent had that obligation in the district court, because they have the obligation to prove that this enhancement has that substantial or that serious potential risk of physical injury to another and of course they didn't do that. but if you look back in this court's decision in 1985 in tennessee versus official garner, this court was talking about completed burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a person would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the percentage i think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time. but that's in a completed burglary. that's not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the risk 
how can you reconcile that with your concession that if the person who  who buys it at an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit? you would not allow recovery in that situation.
if you intend to aid and abet robbery, you intend to aid and abet robbery, you can be held liable for an unintended rape of another. if you aid and abet 
well, bear with me for a minute, your honor. she has to choose a portrait of her beloved husband to hang in the law school. these portraits were taken at different times, they have different qualities, different features. and she has to choose one. and this decision proves extraordinarily difficult for her to make. and she compares the relative qualities of the two portraits. they're both good. she loved her husband. and she simply cannot choose between the two. and so, she does one of two things. one is that she just can't bear to debate with herself anymore about which one is the better-quality portrait; and so, she becomes agnostic about it and says, "i give up. pick one." and so, she picks one. the other is that the decision is simply too difficult for her to make; and so, she abdicates that decision and says, "let the dean pick." and you can analogize that to the ways in which this statute can operate. and the jury can arrive at equipoise by becoming agnostic about the decision on whether  on the balance between aggravating/mitigating 
may i just ask, what  if the proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant considered the police officer to be an alien, why would he have any intent? why wouldn't your argument go, as well, to second degree?
well, they're in exactly the same position as the bartender in  or the beer vendor in  in craig v. boren. they're representing prospective clients, prospective patients as in singleton v. wulff again. this court has over and over again  in fact, in triplett itself, this court recognized that  specifically said that in triplett that it applied to prospective clients, that the  and it said that in triplett that  it quoted the three factors. and it said that  excuse me. i'm looking at the wrong page. it said in triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a due process right to obtain legal representation falls squarely within this principle. and that was the principle of third party standing that this court cited 
so it is literally within the plain language of the statute.
i'd like to pursue the question i asked you earlier because i really didn't fully understand your answer. it seems to me, as i read 2680, it simply says that if one of the exceptions applies, there's no waiver of sovereign immunity, basically. that's what  what the scope of it is. and therefore, none of the other provisions of  of this chapter apply, and if none of the provisions of this chapter apply, clearly the judgment bar provision is one of those.
thank you, ms. lovitt. mr. nolas, you have about 4 minutes left.
you tell me yes or no. was it  was it consistent with the confession?
most of the time, a plan is  i don't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a plan at the same time as they file the notice, the motion to convert.
well, if we conclude, looking at the treaty, that it prohibits hoasca, covers it, and that it provides that nations that enter into the convention must avoid importation of it, then is that a compelling interest under rfra?
that part is a federal issue, but what michigan 
well, as an abstract theoretical matter, the government could reach back many, many decades. as a practical matter, though, that's never happened that we've gone back, say, 50 or 100 years and there are practical reasons for that. first is that the agency does not have enough resources to audit  official
it always  it always does, yes. (laughter.)
 does the gravamen  well, i'll let you finish your answer.
what  what the  what the court was doing was  the  the standard that the court announced at the beginning of its opinion was a reasonable  a reasonable time limitation, the application of which is subject to court review. as applied to permanent resident aliens, the court saw a  a constitutional problem and, in that situation, came up with a presumptive 6-month rule.
that's right. we have no problem with a voluntary waiver. we certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in michigan, as everywhere else, unless  unless you agree to waiver 
but, you're coming up with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up with.
no, no. i thought that the provision that was  what is the number  - where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.
i have  i will take judicial cognizance of the fact that such proposals are sometimes politically controversial. isn't that the place to fight out this thing? isn't your basic objection here that you don't agree that a state should give tax credits to business, and that's something that, you know, is in the political arena, and let the people fight it out?
may i just interrupt for the one  you said "the only significant use." there's a footnote in the red brief that says the figure is some 2.6 billion legitimate uses.
and the objection in the feet first is that you want fewer instrument passes and so on.
well, erisa has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us.
now, in  in city of chicago, we did not give that meaning to the term civil action. now, then you would say, well, city of chicago is a federal question case.
well, i'm not sure that one is completely formalistic. the court said there, that gives people a choice. they can still take it out of the state if they want to, and they may have good reason to. going back to the trash argument, the trash example, you could provide it for free; but a consumer might say, you know what, i'd like to have more days of pickup than you're providing me. or i think their trucks of this private company are a lot nicer; i'd rather have a van stopping in front of my house than your beaten up municipal truck. so a case like wunnicke establishes that that's the way it works. that it's okay to have alternatives. what you can't have is forcing people to do this through regulation.
supposing there was a lot of evidence introduced in the district court that there were schools like yale and new york university that did include this as part of a curriculum, could the district official court disregard that finding and make a contrary finding?
and you should not, because what those courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate that congress has already spoken, in two different ways. first, congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted aedpa, it did not amend 2242, and it did not amend rule 15(c). and, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is really the only set of cases where there is an incentive to delay, congress specifically spoke. and in 2266(b)(3)(b) congress said, "amendments to petitions shall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the petitioner can make a showing for a second or successive petition." now, this is lindh versus murphy all over again. this is a case where congress has spoken as to chapter 154. in lindh versus murphy, it said, "that chapter will be  the amendment will be applied retroactively to cases then pending." they did not do anything with chapter 153 cases. the negative implication, when congress so specifically addresses this issue for one limited, narrow set of cases  and that really make sense in death-penalty cases, does it not? when the state gives the death-penalty petitioner lawyers for state post-conviction review, then all of those claims are done in state habeas, they are brought together, it fulfills the claim-gathering function of the antiterrorism act; and then, very logically, congress determined, "we should have a very, very strict restriction of amendments."
i have not  i've not looked at them to see whether they correspond to 1920, your honor.
is there an entry  is there a time entry on the dock  on court's order?
right.
but, surely 
may i  may i  i just want to make sure. there is then a direct disagreement of fact between you and the attorney general. i understood him to say they got the form that starts at ja-58, and i understand you to be saying they don't.
and until there is an order of exclusion, even now the parole statute is the only statute that governs the detention and release of the alien. and i think it would be impossible to read into 1182(d)(5)(a) any 6-month limitation or any limitation at all on how long someone can be detained because that statute sets up a presumption of custody with release only in the discretion of the attorney general, or now the secretary of  of homeland security.
the flashing headlights which was  there was a citation. there was an arrest for the tape recording and a citation for the flashing headlights. could there have been a  an arrest for the flashing headlights, or is that a lesser category of offense that's not an arrestable offense?
well, except that he's not permanently barred, because if he  if he hasn't exhausted, he gets sent back and has to at least file the last appeal. thank you, your honor.
they would have had to have made a probable cause determination in good faith and conveyed and communicated 
well 
mr. sullivan, you refer to the disclosure as being the key point and when you measure the  the loss and so forth. what if the information leaks out and there's no specific one disclosure that does it all and the stock gradually declines over a period of six months?
 to my colleagues, but i'm very much interested in hearing what ms. bunn has to say.
no, but (k) says you can consider it under (k).
that's right, but i guess what i'm trying to say is it's not that the judge said, you know, ms. prosecutor, you've appeared before me many times and i'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt because i know the way you are. we have nothing like that here. also, as far as it being instinctive, batson and miller-el require the prosecutor to give the reasons and stand and fall on the plausibility of those reasons. and  and here 
but what about the fourteenth? i thought that was one of the absolute restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people on the basis of their race. you can pursue the objectives that your school board is pursuing, but at some point you come against an absolute, and aren't you just denying that?
well, under i guess the government, you can bring everything under 60(b). by the way, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b) because of change of law, they're almost bound to lose. there are hardly any cases which find that an adequate ground under 60(b). but they let you do anything under 60(b), i take it, as long as the claims presented do not  as long as they are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new legal claims or new evidence. now, i just noticed there's another one here. do not support habeas relief. maybe that's the problem.
none of which mentions an overt act.
because that 
correct.
well, but the  the whole point of the district  correct if i'm wrong. this is your area. the whole point of the district was to make it easier for the united states to know with whom it was dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well, that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the district.
well, i think that that is the  whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require us to answer that question because i think that the examination the court would undertake would again 
so if the causation standards are in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't that right?
i think as  as  in the examples i gave, knock and announce works the same way. these are not prerequisites. they're rules of conduct. they are principles of behavior. it's not do this only if you behave in this manner. it's do this and behave in this manner while doing it. and if you don't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the question is what flows from that misbehavior, not from the achievement of the end.
it's the rule.
but then you were denying them, as i understood the argument.
no. that's not correct, justice souter. in fact, there was no particular ratio that had to be followed of cement to sludge. there was testimony that different individuals who worked on the pondcrete used different amounts of cement. and as i said 
so you're telling me you don't have a case.
i think i'd have to  i mean, i think it would depend 
mr. niver 
 or the grievances 
why?
with regard to a narrower swath of land than what's at issue here. and in any event, the court expressly did not pronounce on the effect of the buffalo creek treaty here. if that's the case, what could well result is a patchwork quilt of jurisdiction which this court has said poses tremendous governance problems. it's governance by tract book. this is not just hypothetical. there are already difficulties that have started to arise as a result of the second circuit's decision. for example, another tribe relying on the decision here purchased land within its original land claim area that's just 300 yards from a local high school and have begun operation of a gaming hall there. the locality attempted to enjoin operation of the gaming hall, but was unable to do so in light of the second circuit's decision below. we anticipate there are will be many other problems of that sort that will arise. the residents of the area here have long settled and justifiable expectations. the settlement patterns are clear here. the absence of any exercise of u.s. jurisdiction outside a very small plot of land is not controverted. these are factors that this court has repeatedly held in cases like hagen and yankton sioux are relevant to the question of both what the contemporaneous understanding of the treaty was and what the result should be today, and we submit that they should lead to the same result here as well. if there are no further questions 
all of the fees under subsections (1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier 
are punitive damages available under title ix?
agreed, your honor. but some of the cases suggest that the issue of federal law, in order to be deemed substantial, must be one that is in good faith disputed. that is to say, undisputed issues of federal law are not substantial enough by themselves to confer federal question jurisdiction. so i point out that the disputed federal issue from a different statute, 6339(b)(2), is in the nature of a defense that darue asserted. notwithstanding the strict  the lack of strict compliance with the notice provision, 6339(b)(2) allows substantial compliance.
i can't really answer that, and that's at the heart of 
so then, you think there are instances in which the state can require that a official procedure be used, even if it's not the safest procedure?
 who found it was not voluntary?
what i'm saying is, for double jeopardy purposes 
mr. rosenkranz.
at most  i mean, they could certainly make the argument. at most, preclusion would give way on the ultimate lucas question, not all of the subsidiary issues that were resolved en route to that determination, issues akin to the ones that we recited at pages 10 and 11 of our brief. that is, if the district  if the state court finds, you know, that the property is in such and such a place and on such and such a year, this thing happened or that the ordinance, as it applied, had this effect or that effect, there certainly would be no possible argument that issue preclusion wouldn't apply because they  those were necessary determinations and they had a full and fair opportunity to determine it. as to the ultimate issue, this would be  the full faith and credit act directs the federal court to ask what would the law of california say about this. if they tried to then bring their federal constitutional lucas theory in state court, would issue preclusion or claim preclusion principles bar a second bite at the litigation apple? the answer ordinarily  and you've asked me to assume that the tests that they have  they purport to be stating the federal standard. ordinarily the answer would be no if the argument simply is they made a mistake. i mean, that's  that's what happens in issue preclusion. that's what in allen v. mccurry and  and all of the cases in which this court has applied full faith and credit, kremer and  and  i'm forgetting the names of the other cases. the argument was, yes, they thought they were adjudicating rights under the fourth amendment, but they were wrong, and issue preclusion shouldn't apply. i'm  i'm qualifying my answer a little bit because i do think that if you came to federal court and said, look, this was a sham or they  they  their analysis was so skewed that it can't fairly be said that they were really applying the federal standard, something like, you know, the  the aedpa standard now that  that you get review if it's an  not just an incorrect determination, but a wholly unreasonable application of law or fact. then i think you would look and see, well, would a state court say, well, that's right. i mean, if your allegation is that they were so far off the reservation that it really wasn't a determination of that issue, i think you get a new review. i mean, i do think 
may i just  i'm sorry. may i just take you back to the point of the objective being protection of election integrity. as i understand it, so far as the protection of election integrity is concerned, with respect to these contributions, that is simply the obverse side or the flip side, if you will, of protecting the right of the dissenting union member or the non-joined  strike that  the non-union worker, to control the use of the funds that would be used for the political purposes. the one is simply the obverse of the other. do you agree?
there's no other creditor.
well, he  but whatever that person's position was, vis-a-vis its customer, doesn't affect the relationship between reeder-simco and volvo, and that individual and volvo.
that's right. no discussion whatsoever, your honor.
right.
the right to initiate a suit solely on the basis  not that i was denied procedures, not that i, i paid money for private schooling, but i do not believe the outcome, the education given to my child in the public school was enough.
no, to the extent you're talking about dollar liability, i don't think that's true. i do think it's fair to say that in recklessness generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury that could result, can  we'll tolerate less risk. if the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to somebody, we'll  the law will tolerate a lesser degree of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or maybe even a dollar injury. and it's not set. it's a variable calculation. so in that sense, it is. i don't think that when we talk about a high and objective risk in this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, that a company would have to pay, although i'm sure they are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers. what we are talking about here  and this is a very unusual statute the way it's written  the liability itself, not just the damages, but the liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from law. you have to  there is no recovery here like there is in almost  or commonly in federal statutes for just a violation. that isn't it. you have to show either a willful violation or a negligent violation, and that requires a determination not only that the defendants violated the law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how many standard deviations from correct their position was and that is an objective determination. once an objectively high risk has been found by a court, then  then the case can shift to looking into subjective things. i think a plaintiff would be entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to infer the existence of willfulness from that. and that's often when defendants  i'm sorry.
they'd like to have a monopoly, and 
 it happens.
i didn't mean in the leasing context here. but in the leasing context, one  there are a couple of important points. one is that the government does not have enough resources to audit all of the current accounts in all of the years, which is one of the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther when we catch the violation. as a  but as a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50 years ago, there's a reason that's never happened. in addition, the farther we try to go back, the greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the companies have the information that shows what royalties they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go back, because of proof problems.
no. your honor, first of all, this is, i think, an unusual characterization, namely for this to be called political speech. we would 
the likelihood of?
we believe it is, in part, because this is an affirmative obligation on the state. miranda is a rule, for example, that requires you to say what the  the rules of the game are and this is how it works. this is different. this is fundamentally different. this says, you've got to tell him individually to go out  you've got to tell him that he has a right to go out and ask somebody for help, and it gets him access to resources that are uniquely within the possession and control of a consular officer. the government immigration records. the consular  the lawyer could not have gotten those records. they were crucial to the defense. more fundamentally, the lawyer didn't even know those existed. so even if you would assume that an ineffective assistance claim could remedy violations  and  and we certainly believe this case and a large category of other cases could never be remedied through ineffective assistance claims as a practical matter. even then, all it does is breed ineffective assistance claim after ineffective assistance claim because the trial lawyer doesn't know what's in the embassy's file.
part of 
how is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?
well, what else had he provided beyond  did you use anything that came from him?
 we, neverthe-  i'm sorry, justice 
it  it does not rely on the proposition that there's a situation in which there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly okay.
you may answer.
in the civil context, you always have a question of, do we let in other loan transactions in a breach of contract, or, do we let in another pattern or practice or  of similar products? i mean, there's line-drawing, when it comes up in the civil context, all the time, every day in district courts. but, justice kennedy, in habeas there are more than ordinary principles of finality at stake that aren't  that just aren't true in any tort or contract action. and this court said that in the calderon decision. and the reason is because of the interest in not just the prosecutor in having adequate notice 
you  you seem 
if it is a covered class action, that is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth 
so far, you're halfway into your argument. i thought the basic question here was, first, whether a court of appeals, or anybody, can grant a j-  what used to be called a jnov without your making its  whatever it's called now  and without somebody making it a motion. and from your not opposing that, i guess the answer to the question is, of course not. of course you have to make a motion. you have to make a motion for everything. the judge is not a genius. he can't  is not a mindreader. and if you don't make a motion, you lose. okay? now, is there any argument against that?
but in 
if you say you're not going to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to discriminate on the basis of race.
well, i don't think the court affirmatively decided the issue. i think the distinction didn't matter to the majority. i think the majority is focusing on the consequences of putting up barriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes and local processing requirements. and you could take almost any one of the court's cases and just substitute in public ownership. take, for example 
right. no. our  i mean, we think there are two related points. one is that a genuine opt-out of the waiver and a general opt-out of the act, an attempt to obtain time that's not excludable under the act is not permissible because that would thwart the public interest in a speedy trial. but where the error is a purely procedural one, a failing to record findings in the record regarding a continuance that is permitted under the substantive standards of the act, then holding the defendant to the waiver, under a theory of either waiver or estoppel  in our view doesn't matter which 
yes.
on 
no, justice breyer, it does not, because had he left in 1996, upon enactment of iirira, he would have been inadmissible for 5 years 
it is equivalent to that, in the following sense. they understood that if they  if they didn't get a license, that they would be exposed to genentech's claims under the  under the infringement laws. and in order to avoid that exposure, even though they had all the information they needed to assess the validity of this patent at the time 
 there was extensive testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison setting.
it is a post-notice and comment rule.
was that a case about article iii case or controversy?
may i interrupt you? i thought you said that, in this case, as distinct from givhan, there would be cognizable employer interests in incompetence, the truth of what was said, the capacity to do the job without roiling the waters unduly, and so on. and that, i take it, is not necessarily so in a givhan situation. or is it?
i'm sorry?
well, the circumstances that you were given was a traffic offender.
he files it electronically.
so you're 
i 
the blood did not deteriorate. the enzyme did not deteriorate. but there is no such testimony. instead, you seem to be relying on the difference between the word incomplete and inconclusive, a difference that dr. blake says is inconclusive or incomplete.
that's correct, your honor. and his affidavit describes his meetings with the fbi and epa beginning in 1986, and that's at joint appendix 180 through 181.
 it says to look at the  the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. we don't think the term expenses in  in that provision can fairly be read to somehow dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of the costs. we think it's much more naturally to read that as just a reference, as this court noted in casey, to the common practice of including out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for things like copying costs and  and necessary travel expenses and things like that as  as also being compensable. and so we don't think that that  that term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning of the statutory provision at issue here. and as far as subsection (b) of that provision related to the gao, we think it's clear that it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases, and is instructing the gao to do a broader study about the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and others on both sides in these cases because congress was very concerned about the amount of litigation and the expense of that litigation and the diversion of funds away from the core educational services of the schools. as this court noted in schaffer, that's one of the primary concerns congress has had, especially in the more recent amendments to the act. and we think, in fact, that the  the fact that congress instructed the gao to study that is, if anything, more consistent with the idea that congress decided not to legislate on the question of expert fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had the benefit of that study at a minimum. now 
 you say your answer is, you don't make the concession?
 there are a hundred purchases by each of them at different prices. what more do they have to prove, other than that they were in the same relevant market?
right, but i'm saying the scope of the problem is  is much more narrow than what is suggested by simply describing how often it is that the  that the complaining witness is reluctant to testify. that doesn't stop anything.
well, it seems to me that's what we're back to, that it's long been treated as jurisdictional. but you just said that it's not sufficient that it's been enacted by congress and it's not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court to another. so we're back just to history, right?
are you going to address the mid-con question?
no, but there's no  there's no probable cause until the triggering event. when  when the triggering event takes place, you've eliminated the 16 others and you do know that it's  it's  there's probable cause. how is that different from this case?
well, it would be accurate 
but if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing.
she is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case. she starts out even, and it builds up over time.
in your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?
brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari. you  you did not raise this.
but  but then you get to the 
it may  it may have been but it would be something that would be evaluated under strickland, justice stevens.
correct. there's no  in an issue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim for the request for information, and there's no allegation of wrongdoing. so, it's just not a complaint in those ways. also, it doesn't  it's not really fair to say that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an audit and an order to pay. so it doesn't  and plus, it's, of course, not filed in a civil action. and, in that respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the  any of the elements of the  of the ordinary definition of "complaints."
again, i could point to the  the prosecutor's response in the motion to vacate. i can point to the court's judgment and sentence, which i don't have the cite for right off the  my head, but it is in the joint appendix. on that form, as is common in washington, there are two boxes for the court to check. one says that a verdict regarding a deadly weapon  or excuse me  that a firearm other than a deadly weapon was returned. the other says that a  a  excuse me. one says that a verdict form for finding that the person was armed with a firearm was returned. the other says that it was merely the verdict form for being armed with a deadly weapon other than the firearm. the trial 
it was not, and we are not suggesting it is, although it's entitled to chevron deference. but if you get past the minimal level of objective standard, the question becomes what indicia and markers were out there that would have guided this company as to whether there was a high risk that they were violating the act. and certainly the ball letter, which was sent by the staff specifically to address this exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than the best available rate based on their credit score was an adverse action. and in addition, there was 
well, they could be expenses of the attorney. but if they were to be  be set aside separately, that's no indication that  that congress intended that expenses of other individuals be shifted to the cost  shifted, rather, to the school district. it's a direction to the gao to acquire data 
justice scalia, that's 
well, it isn't that  isn't one of the answers to justice breyer's questions that you  you never know exactly what a fact finder would do. what you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods and reasonable possibilities.
 the implied repeal analysis is not the proper analysis to apply here, because the proper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses resort to the more general remedy, when two things are true.
why is  i'm trying to find out  i understand what you think of gratz. we can agree or disagree about that. but the overall view of the constitution, that interpretation that you have in your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, i mean, basically  all right? think  go back to cooper versus aaron. go back to the case where this court with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to get those children into the school. that's because the society was divided. here we have a society, black and white, who elect school board members who together have voted to have this form of integration. why, given that change in society  which is a good one  what  how can the constitution be interpreted in a way that would require us, the judges, to go in and make them take the black children out of the school? see, my objection to your approach to the constitution is primarily a practical one.
but that's because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental way for the following reason: that under the barnett bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of preemption that applies in the context of national banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or incidental powers of national banks  and one incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be the power to conduct affairs through an operating subsidiary  that the grants of those powers are normally preemptive of rather than preempted by state law> and so once the operating 
and  and their  their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the  that the nonreduction clause refers to. they are saying  i think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. yes. and if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. i think that's what they're saying.
well, as you have observed, virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities. then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates the whole function, is  can fix prices, fix his, what are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of the antitrust laws. there are other reasons why a manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid the prohibitions of the antitrust law. it is also  so, this is old and well settled. unlike the schwinn rule against territorial restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it was established, or the albrecht rule against maximum resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years after it was established, this has a much more settled pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up around it. second, it was endorsed and relied on by congress, not enacted by congress but endorsed and relied on by congress, when congress repealed the fair trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this court is now asked to interpret.
mr. chief justice, that's why i finished off on that. let me just focus on the important part of my statement. and that is, we are talking about a search of the home, at the core of the fourth amendment. this court's doctrines are quite different about situations in which you share information with third parties. let me step back and do the case before lopez, and then explain how it was extended to lopez. cases like white say, "if you give information to someone else, you  they can give it to the police without conducting a search of you." this is a very different situation. the police are clearly conducting a search of a premises that i think, justice souter, it has to be agreed, he has a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to. now, justice souter, it is absolutely right that there are instances in which people have expectations of privacy, and yet searches occur, notwithstanding those. and there is an argument to be made here that says, "look, he has a reasonable expectation of privacy, but the police came in for a different reason." that would be true, for example, if there was a warrant; they would come in, notwithstanding his reasonable expectation. that would be true if there were exigent circumstances. but the theory of consent is very different. schneckloth, zap, all of the court's precedents 
mr. goldberg, may i ask you to clarify one thing about your argument? you say that you should have permitted  been permitted to introduce this evidence to show that this act was not  - the "act" being, kill a police officer  was not done intentionally or knowingly. but you seem to indicate that clark could have been convicted, under the arizona code, of some degree of murder. am i right about that? and, if so, what degree?
 let's think 
can i pick "trivial impact"? [laughter.]
that rule can be ignored by state prosecutors?
you would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually  eventually ordered?
based 
yes, what it says  that's what  it says, to review legal materials, one at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a mini law library in hand. all right. why couldn't you have a  if he wants to see the newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't there be a copy there, only the parts that are consistent with the censorship policy, just like a news of the day.
thank you, mr. rovelli. mr. marcus.
can you 
well, that would mean that the inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers, but not  not the christian science monitor.
i thought what your argument was  and if it's not, forget it, it's just that i don't understand it. that here the government says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own action. and then later on they say, they define it differently. they talk about prevailing party. the parents of the prevailing party. but you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase. because it wouldn't make sense for the government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant. that's your argument?
would that be a plan then?
well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here. i mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. they know there's risk that this is unlawful.
and if he is, why isn't it a lesser-included offense is my next question.
mr. draper, correct me if i'm wrong. i  i looked at these papers a while ago. i thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the  the relevant amounts in the 10th year.
 true adversity? i thought the assumption underlying the  everybody's hypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be invalid, that the license  then the license agreement is also invalid. is that  is that right?
i 
you can't use red if the statute says green. green doesn't include red. i understand that. and that's why, in fact, i wondered if the presence in this bill of the gao section suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the word cost means something special. and if that's so, then i would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to the legislative history. it's not like using the word red and arguing it includes green.
and it's not 
your honor, at this point, and for some 
but i thought we were basically dealing with conflict 
then it may still be reasonable. it may still be reasonable, your honor.
my question is the following. in puerto rico and in the philippines after 1916, and in alaska, were there any instances in which they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value? they either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to find out.
the 
no, he  you're right, mr. chief justice, that it's  that he's illegally reentered. but he wouldn't be covered by this provision, because all this provision seeks to do is to remove him. and then, once he's gone back, this provision simply ceases to have any relevance to him at all, because he's, in some sense, self-removed. and so, he  any ineligibility wouldn't stem from this provision, it would come from somewhere else. and, as far as i'm aware, he wouldn't  he wouldn't be subject to the 5-year period of inadmissibility that's imposed by a separate provision and that would attach if he were removed, because, by hypothesis, he wouldn't have removed, he would have gone back on his own accord.
and that's because it's a local  it's a toledo city property tax, is that the distinction you're making?
your  your friend in the  in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that counties were not subject to suit.
and when you do that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for the harm to others? you're going to award a higher multiple with respect to the damages 
there is no opinion of this court that talks about orders per se. there is, however, what i would classify as a more quirky property interest, and that was the logan versus simmerman brush case. that case dealt with the situation where there was a statute that provided a cutoff for when somebody could sue for unemployment benefits or discriminatory allegations in the state of illinois. and the court there held that while there is really a right in this process, to go through this process and by cutting it off without any opportunity for notice or a hearing, the state of illinois 
and my  my second question is i noticed you quoted from a minnesota law review about 250 cases, and the  your opponent pointed out that the  the next sentence of the article said the holdings don't support the generalization. and i would just like to ask you, apart from the markham case, what is the case  what holding of a case lends the greatest support to your probate exception argument.
 think that the treaty  the convention entered into in 1971  makes clear that hoasca is covered, then does that provide a compelling interest for the government, because it requires the government to prohibit the importation? if we think, as a matter of law, the convention covers hoasca.
well, i'm saying, that's how the statute works.
i  well, that harassment limitation is sufficient to protect the residuum of an expectation 
and that there was a significant overlap in the three charges in the three cases. the prosecutor had been told in two of them, you went too far. in this one, just in terms of what the prosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less offensive or would you say they're all on a par?
i mean, what's bothering me about this case is, i don't know that the government needs to argue that there is a different rule. as i read the lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words "core operative fact." core operative facts in a tort case, where the engine of train a runs into the caboose of train b, is that collision. and the decision that the front  the locomotive should have been lit, as well as the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the same operative fact. core operative facts. but to say that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a different set of core operative facts from the fact that the defendant was questioned before the trial. now, that seems to me related to the nature of habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, "core operative fact," the same words, work differently in the two situations. and to adopt your approach also strikes me as running around the one-year statute of limitations. now, those are my concerns, and i would appreciate your addressing them.
but the 
because text  as this court has said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context. so you have to look at where the provision is placed and what congress meant by that provision and look at the statute as a whole. if anyone  if we look 
well 
none that i am aware of, your  your honor, but 
 that's a wash.
is it, is it clear that he can go to district  i mean, i'm not familiar with how these things work. is it possible that when there is an appeal or certiorari pending here there can be proceeding in district court a habeas action on the same, on the same matter that we are considering on certiorari?
no. but has  has the 7 prosecutor got to use a phrase like future dangerousness 8 or a synonym for that phrase?
well, i'm not sure. if there's data earlier, at the ind stage, as a result of the lab tests and the animal tests, i would think that would be part of the exemption.
suppose, in the memo here, the assistant district attorney had said, "i think that this deputy lied, and i think the deputy should be fired." now, whether the deputy should be fired or not probably isn't within the job duties of this  of this employee. so, would that be outside of your rule?
well, justice scalia, i think that the rule does permit this practice, and if you look at the history of the rule, it makes it even more clear. the  the advisory committee rejected a rule, akin to what the state is arguing today, that a mandate should be effective when it should have issued. and the reason they denied that rule was because you can't tell from looking at the docket whether the reason is a clerical error or the act of a judge delaying issuance in the mandate. that alone makes clear that the committee had in mind circumstances in which judges would delay issuing their mandates without issuing formal orders to that effect. numerous courts of appeals have come to that conclusion, and we think that's entirely consistent with the rules, in addition to the reasons i  i stated earlier, that i think in this case particularly, there were reasons that the state was aware of the fact that the court was engaged in sua sponte reconsideration of its decision. if there are no further questions.
yes, your honor. i think we still don't know which definition new hampshire would use.
that's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere. that's what preclusion doctrine is all about. we respect the judgment of the court that rendered it. we, therefore, give it full faith and credit. that's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit. isn't that so?
so, why is it mail-specific?
thank you, mr. meczyk. general madigan, you have i think about 3 minutes left.
yes, your honor.
and what i don't understand is even  even if we agree with you that it should be done annually, why  why wouldn't you propose that it be done annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can use the previous 10 years? i  i don't understand why we have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'benefit of  of this methodology.
well, it's the same warrant i believe, your honor, in terms of  we don't have  there's not a lot of information in the record about 
i don't think it would, justice o'connor, at least not since 1994, because in 1994 congress passed a statute that i think is best read as ratifying the practice of lethal injection. this is 18 u.s.c. 3596. and that statute authorizes the federal government to use the method of execution in the state of the sentencing court. and at the time that was passed, in 1994, the overwhelming majority  something like 25 of the 38 states  had already used lethal injection. so, i would read that as 
didn't  didn't that case involved the  a violation there  involve the addition of a pollutant? and there was no addition of a pollutant, because the water was equally polluted on each side. wasn't that the 
how many lawyers  you're talking about a very refined assertion of a constitutional right. i mean there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lawyers, and what you're saying is that if he doesn't get choice one, choice two is just not going to do, no matter how close, no matter how similar their approaches are going to be. it's not like he's, you know, wants a rolls royce and he gets a  you know, whatever  a yugo or something. he could choose, you know, the next best out of hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
you mean 
i'm not talking about the expenditure. i'm talking about the contribution limits. i and my friends have the following thought. we don't know who the candidates for state rep are, but we want a republican slate or we want a democratic slate. so we get all our $5 together, give them to the democratic party or the republican party in vermont, and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than $100 in an election to a state rep, et cetera. now, to the  to the ear, that sounds as if a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that wants to challenge is going to have a really tough time. so i want you to explain it.
yes, i 
that is correct. let me make one last 
that would be the argument in favor of an expansive reading of the language in the hypothetical example to cover that case. but it would not be consistent with the general policies of antitrust law.
congress didn't care.
well it makes  it is linguistically logical to say that we're, therefore, going to assume that a pollutant is not needed here. but when congress has replaced the "discharge of a pollutant" with a "discharge into," it seems to me congress has actually moved in the other direction of reinforcing that we're talking about 
that's true unless the california legislature does what most states have done in response to booker, which is not that route at all. they did maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just required the jury finding. that's what i think seven out of nine states have done.
so we write that this is an additive thing?
if that's so then  then on the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what would have happened if there had been gold because it might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most, $50. but if there had been gold, because of the gold market in the world, it would have been a lot more valuable. and you're saying he can't do that? i don't know. maybe that question isn't in the case, but that strikes me as a difficult question.
 no question 
so that  that would take care of the four claims. how about the other four?
when we have this happy agreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove what you  you have to plead what you intend to do, that is, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my theory. i would like to know  maybe we won't get beyond this, but in looking at this, i wondered now suppose that the stock goes up in value because of extraneous things. can you recover because it would have been still higher?
it had all those documents.
your honor 
 with this question? aren't you really saying that when the deprivations get beyond some point, some serious point, the issue is not properly analyzed under turner and safley, can they do one thing more? the issue really becomes one of cruel and unusual punishment. is the totality that they have taken away so great that it is cruel to maintain these people under these circumstances? is that the argument you're really making?
yes, that's right.
in the  the one case involving a change in the opinion, where the tax court judge said, i don't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge, there was no published opinion of the special trial judge. so i don't believe there's a procedure for the dissent. but the point is the court of appeals 
 certainly can. but there's no  and, as a practical matter  i mean, because the government bears the initial burden of going forward, if the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on balance, going to be in its favor. but, in addition, there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the secretary can require they be kept for longer. in addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof issues in situations where the statute might, because of tolling, be much longer. so, there's not a strict official congruence. there is also no indication that congress enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was thinking about a 6-year limitations period. there's never been any linkage between the two. if i could briefly cover, then, also  i mean, in addition to all the textual points, this is also located in the judicial code. and, although it's true that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly. every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code  and petitioners identified no examples  every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers to a suit in court, and only a suit in court. when a provision of the judicial code applies to something else, it will say so. for example, 28 u.s. code 2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding." the federal tort claims act is very clear that what it's talking about is submitting something to an agency. so, if congress was going to legislate against the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the provision in the judicial code, i mean, that just is a totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially official clear  especially a clear intent, when it's trying to govern administrative proceedings. the committee reports also strongly confirm that, because they not only say that the statute defines the time limitation for bringing an action in the u.s. courts, and not only use court terminology from front to back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings. the committee has explained that the reason for that provision was the great number and variety of administrative proceedings. so, in other words, congress was saying, "there's a great variety of administrative procedure. we're just not going to deal with that here. we're taking it off the table by saying this limitations period does not expire until a year after those administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have expired." there's also some relevance in the fact that this legislation was proposed by the justice department as part of an overall package of reforms that would govern the civil litigation that the department was handling in the courts. it was then referred to the judiciary committees, not to the house government reform committees official that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, as i mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial code. from start to finish, this legislation has never had anything to do with anything other than court suits, which is why congress has expressly provided for context-specific administrative systems  limitations periods  which make sense in the context of the relevant administrative procedures.
it can be brought if there's state law and evidence to support the state law that doesn't attack the labeling. and our 
 within his job duties.
but form 58  i'm  i'm looking at page 58  says that the prisoner will be given this form that says you were referred to the classification committee for the following reasons. and that leaves space to be filled out. what's the matter with that?
i'm sure there's an example somewhere, but i  i practiced law for over 40 years, and i never heard of it.
i'm not so sure about that because why doesn't the theory that  that applies to the lawyer equally apply to the wife? i mean, she took care of everything going on at home, and that enabled him to go out there and make all that money. so without her services, just like without the lawyer's services 
do you think it becomes unconstitutional when  when you have one more test? what did it become unconstitutional? the first test was not unconstitutional.
are there cases  are there cases on that?
i  i think it is flimsy and i'll tell you why because i think paternalistically the state of oklahoma is way off or the republican party, if they thought that way in alaska, would be off. if you really think about it, a party, particularly at the general election, wants its loyal voters to get to the poll. actually this would be a benefit to the republican and democratic parties in oklahoma or the republican party in alaska because it allow them to find out which of their voters had voted in their primary and which had defected to another party. when they're sending out mailers or doing phone banks or driving people to the polls, they're going to want to take their loyal voters. so this will actually serve to help them to identify some of their voters who aren't loyal, and they won't want to bring them in. so i'm saying that 
he's present in the court while they're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating evidence. the judge is quite careful, saying okay, if he doesn't want the evidence, i want to know what it is. and he called the two witnesses. and all that this defendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to present the mitigation.
right.
twice at the head from essentially point-blank range, your honor.
what the house committee 
just take, for example, the  the palm print. the chief mobley said he found it in  in the apartment, and that would be very strong evidence, if in fact that was the case. but his credibility was contested. so how can you conclude that the palm print is strong evidence for the prosecution without implicitly making a determination, a credibility determination?
we  we think the more direct  i don't think so for  partly for the reason that i  that i gave to justice breyer is that  that that would not protect against discovery and  and the sort of chilling inquiry that this court has recognized in its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial function where the prosecutor would be required to disclose. even though the prosecutor is absolutely immune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and his communication with law enforcement agents would  would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny in a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.
that's always true in every edwards case.
okay. so you mean by allowed that plaintiff is  one  he's from the same state and destroys the diversity.
and that  it goes further than this. that's viewpoint discrimination. but this is content discrimination and the court has held in consolidated edison and a number of other cases that that is also a constitutional problem.
i think, first of all, the  the question presented in this case is whether there's a cause of action. those  that question really goes to the amount of money that gets recovered in the cause of action, and actually the  the question presented in the petition doesn't squarely present that. but insofar as where you're going on to that further  because this case can be just answered by saying, yes, there's a cause of action under 502(a)(3). now, insofar as the court goes further into the make-whole doctrine, i think generally courts should  courts have recognized that under erisa what they're supposed to do is enforce the terms of the plan.
it was an issue that was resolved by the jury in this case and i don't understand you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.
right.
has a duty to cooperate with the assignee to the extent that it does not impair the assignor's interest, that is 
they have chosen not to.
except we've rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. eleven circuits are in agreement as to what rogers required. you 
there are a number of responses to that. first, as a factual matter, with respect to welcoming into the united states, what gets cited for that proposition is a statement by president carter in may 5 of 1980. 10 days later, before the aliens in this case came to this country, he made clear that people should not do this. he encouraged people not to go to cuba. the ins brought enforcement actions against people who went there. there were criminal prosecutions that were brought. so people were not encouraged to come to the united states in this way. with respect to the regime that you say  i believe you said they're  they're admitted just like under any other regime. that is not correct.
decided by the court  the texas court of criminal appeals.
and 
 justice souter's question, which is that (a)  2680(a) only applies to a failed execution. there has to be at least an attempted execution. i'm not sure that's true. it says "an act or omission" in the execution. and i think a total  i just don't do the thing at all. i think that's an omission in the execution.
thank you. mr. nathanson, you have about 3 minutes left.
okay.
on the merits, i think that their claim is  take company a and company b. both are located in toledo, both hire a certain number of people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount of property, and have a certain amount of business. identical. and they're charged a tax. and now, what  company b, when it's thinking of building a new plant or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all those things that were already in ohio. and, therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought, because that old tax, which really had nothing to do with this new investment, is now less because of the new investment. so, that hurts businesses in wisconsin. as i understand it, that's their claim. and if i've got it wrong, i'm sure you'll correct me.
right.
i just learned this morning that some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert for explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber in a tire. they didn't realize that. and i think it's entirely possible that dogs would  there will be false alerts by  by dogs because it's triggered by something that  that is not really anticipated.
your honor, but for the alternative minimum tax, there would be an  a miscellaneous itemized deduction 
i think  in  first of all, it's just dicta in kosak, which, in fact, construed the customs exception to include both  you know, not to turn upon the type of damage that ensued, so we actually are asking for the sort of same analysis of the holding in kosak  the dicta in kosak about motor vehicles is different  i think if i could just  for the logical reason, if someone rear-ends you, you don't 
i understand that's your argument, but you agree that if  if that argument is wrong, you're done.
 produced.
the plaintiff can't know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.
are you going to apply a different standard there than you would apply where  where the reason is some first amendment reason?
well, mr. chief justice, i'm not arguing for any proposition that i think would raise concern. i do think that a general tenet of abuse of discretion review is that the court of appeals can affirm a result that it would not necessarily have reached itself.
one 
 because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping. so i suppose you're telling us that if we find that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's not part of  of united states constitutional law, what we should do is remand to the ninth circuit so that they could determine whether there was probable cause on the other grounds.
yes, justice souter, i think that's correct. i think that there could be meaningful discussions between the defendant and the accused that can help the lawyer represent the defendant at trial.
okay. because we're 
the cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera.
no, do it. do it. make the reasoned moral choice. and the facts are that we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not  we have by the balancing made a determination that anything for the bad that distinguishes this person from the ordinary is  is equally balanced by the good. now, make the moral choice.
the pony express.
perhaps you can take us through this chronologically. you  you began at the end.
right. but that  the  i mean, it's a different claim. the judge has an independent responsibility. it's not the lawyer's responsibility.
because justice thomas' opinion was accurately describing the holding in bazemore on the facts of bazemore, because in bazemore there was a claim, in contrast to this case, of ongoing intentional race discrimination in classifying employees on the basis of their race and paying the black employees less than the whites. if the court would look at the remand order in the bazemore case, they'll see that the court did not remand with instructions that judgment be entered for the united states merely because there was a disparity in salaries.
but i have the same question justice scalia had. i mean, the  the question is you  you have limits here of $100 per election. it's $200 per cycle.
i mean 
well, that is not  we did not stick it on asano. nobody stuck it on asano. they picked asano because it was the prior art of adjustable pedal designs. justice scalia, you 
nancy temple was not a defendant in this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, after having immediately recognized that an sec investigation was highly probable, nancy temple sends out a document reminder saying 
no, justice souter. and that is, the government has argued, and this court has accepted, again  and this is a different point; and that is, you have to have a clear line for police officers that is administrable. and the line that is reflected in matlock and rodriguez is: if you get consent to come into the house from someone who has the common authority to do so, that will be sufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some  and so, you don't have to go around and  finding other people and asking other people. it's just as if you showed up at a house, and you were invited in. you wouldn't say, "well, let me check with everybody else" 
so there's no reason to believe that the same secretary  that the secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?
no, justice scalia. in fact  -
this is  this is a pretrial hearing on whether the  the  there's been intimidation. couldn't the judge just find it more likely than not that the defendant has intimidated a witness?
and maybe  maybe i'd have a harassment action against him if he does it, you know, blatantly. but is that a search?
well, it's a policy decision either way. i  i suppose if zadvydas had come out the other way, the congress could have responded as well.
i  i am not trying to avoid your question, but i'm trying to clarify that i am not asking this court to determine who has the income in those cases because there is a large body of law and a large body of statutory law that answers the questions for each of those examples. all i'm suggesting is that we do not get to those answers. we should not get to those answers through the assignment of income doctrine.
correct, but with respect to the question of racial gerrymandering, this court's question is, is race the predominant motivation? there's a direct factual finding by the district court that it was not. indeed, the district court said that the  that the measures of compactness, examined in relationship to the geography and population, reflect the sheer size and population distribution of this area, rather than a calculated stretch to find voters of a particular ethnic makeup.
 30 minutes. we know that. but, it seems to me, when 30 minutes passed here, there were curative measures. now, you say, at the outset, there can never be a  curative measures. that  i don't think you have anything to  any support for that in the case law.
under  you think 105 is an affirmative grant of power?
 trying to reduct you out of 
but  but, with respect, the court did not construe any word in this statute to impose the limitation that you're describing. the  the way the court posed the question was does it  does it affirmatively grant a power for detention of these aliens in these circumstances. at the very beginning of the court's opinion, the court put to one side 
the code is not patentable. the expression is copyrightable. at&t has not sought to get a patent on the code. at&t has a patent on a system that can be practiced, among other ways, through the use of software.
counsel, before you change subjects, isn't it more accurate that the trial court actually found that the evidence met the gregory standard?
so it  it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.
well, the  the lawyer here did have alternatives. he  he could have put the state to its burden and consistent with the not guilty plea that was entered in the case. or as an alternative, there could have been an inquiry on the record of  by the judge with the lawyers of mr. nixon to determine whether or not he was consenting to this  this sort of  the opening statements and the closing statements, which  which were extraordinary, particularly the closing statement because  and in the closing statement, he specifically said that the state did prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each and every element of the crimes charged, first degree, premeditated murder, kidnapping, robbery, and arson, had been proven, which is truly extraordinary. here is a situation where the lawyer who is the only person in the courtroom, because mr. nixon was tried in absentia, who  the only person in the courtroom who was there as the trusted advisor and counselor for mr. nixon, stands up in front of the jury in the opening and the closing and concedes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. i would submit that upon doing that, the  the whole adversarial process breaks down because it 
they're not assailing the validity of the mark.
ms. blatt, your time is almost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are available to the united states under your reading of the provision? injunctive relief, yes. what about  is there any monetary relief that the united states can seek under rico?
so you draw a distinction between two cases? if they illegally entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it was supposed to be 15. they say, never mind. they go back out. there's another knock. they wait 15 and they come in. then it's all right. correct?
that's true.
i know there is no discussion of burden. but when there is no discussion of burden, isn't the reasonable assumption for us to make, as a reviewing court, the assumption that the california supreme court followed its own law, and its own law is that the burden is on the defendant?
it depends on how it does business. a state bank is a corporation and it is 
our only point, justice breyer, is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court to look at a particular filing deadline in a prison. most of them, incidently, are somewhere between 14 and 30 days. but if there were, for example, a 24-hour filing deadline, our submission is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court to look at that deadline and say, "we think that that's just too short, and, therefore, unreasonable." it would only be appropriate to say that the remedy wasn't available if  regardless of the length of the filing deadline  in a particular case, the facts were such that literally the prisoner were unable to pursue that administrative remedy. if he were literally unable to do so, the remedy would not be available under the plra exhaustion provision. the case on which respondent places 
what was the criterion?
my understanding 
the statute gives the attorney general authority to promulgate regulations for the dispensing of drug  821  and that seems to me to describe precisely what the attorney general has done here.
he did not seek an administrative remedy. he went through the school system itself at every level. he went through five different levels, following the chain of command.
 case, they never claim that ceballos did anything improper, that he exercised poor judgment, that he was insubordinate. they just said, "we didn't retaliate." that was their defense of this case. and that presents a fact question for the jury.
i don't understand. it seems unreasonable to me. he was trying to spare his mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court? that's what he had in mind?
plus 10 percent you say.
it's pretty harsh, but do you think this court would strike it down?
you cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. that's what that holds. but a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. and that's what i understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.
no, no.
excuse me, mr. chief justice. i'm sorry to interrupt. i think in each circumstance it depends on the status of the school system.
that's why we're wondering how to write the opinion. (laughter.)
assuming that it is a violation, what's an example of where it wouldn't be harmless error?
and  and there's no need for the ninth circuit's rule unless there was probable cause because if there was no probable cause, you win on that ground. you don't have to get into this closely related offense doctrine. is that correct?
but if he doesn't have to, he's got to have some reason for doing it. this is not a matter of whim. and if he's got to have a reason and his reasons may not legitimately be those speculations on what might be a legitimate basis for the challenge, but which were never raised by the state, and you can't think of any other reasons  and i admit i can't right now  then it seems to me that he would pretty  it would  it would follow that  that he would be required to  to uphold the challenge.
well, congress has taken a different approach. in some cases, there would be a textual problem. title vii, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. title  and  and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. title ix speaks upon  about discrimination on the basis of sex. and here i think to  to allay your concern about the coach, we have had  title ix's retaliation provision has been the established law. it was the law at the time congress  it was understood, at the time congress enacted title ix, that the identical wording of title vi had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. congress enacted title ix against the background of the sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. so that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title ix. in over 30 years, there  at most we can find 140 reported cases in the federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title ix, and under title ix and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and  in  in dealing with retaliation cases. now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. when it singled coach jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.
 capricious searches.
then why isn't this  this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion.
well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.
i do not believe so, but you should not expand totten in the dramatic way the government asks. and it does not counsel for you to expand totten when they cannot define a clear line as to where this jurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon here  they cannot explain to you why in webster  they argued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the same interpretation of totten that they are arguing now. they specifically said that it should not be up to the courts to look behind the scene of the privilege in reynolds, and yet the court rejected that position. in hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret proceeding with due process and the courts cannot review whether we've made that available, and the court rejected that. things have changed since the time of totten. that does not require overruling totten, but it certainly does not counsel expanding totten in the dramatic way that the executive asserts, a way that basically says to the court you have absolutely no role in determining whether our assertion that the state secret is an essential element here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a state secret. we  if there's anything we ought to be able to decide it's what our case is about. we may have loosely used bargain in the complaint, but the district court and the ninth circuit have now made it very clear that we cannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due process, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a contract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim. the ninth circuit has decided all of that against us. what we still have, though, is a claim to a fair, internal agency procedure.
i think a challenge to the sentence necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. but a challenge to parole is much different because you're not affecting the sentence if you win your case. and the term necessary is completely necessary to the heck analysis, as this court made clear most recently in the nelson case from last term.
mr. chief justice, i think, in this case, there is no other purpose to be served by this statute than to preempt. to the extent that embedded in your honor's question is a question with respect to the so-called presumption against preemption, we don't think that those concerns, or the concerns to which your honor just referred, apply in this case, because the statute is clear; there is no ambiguity in the language that congress used, and hence  and it would have made no sense, mr. chief justice, for congress to have 
exactly. that's what they 
yes, and the  and the judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the parties.
is  is the failure to extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a state just a historical relic? it depends on semantics. or is there some normative or good government policy that dictates the distinction?
this  the trunk of the car didn't have to be opened here.
so the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?
so it's a historical relic based on the dignity of the state, or the king in one case, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the entities on the other?
the complaint  (laughter.)
yes, because that is part of the form. with the court's permission 
no, but are you going to  i mean, is there any light you could shed? and that's why i asked in my question initially. i thought maybe there were some jurisdictions somewhere that  that survive without the rule they want, but maybe i'm wrong. and  and how do i judge this? i would be concerned. i don't  the  after all, these other cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and  and they don't involve the criminal process. and when we get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on selective prosecution that are designed to screen out all but the very worst.
mr. moran, you have 4 minutes remaining.
mr. castanias, suppose the court agrees with you that the response here is not proportionate, and, hence, that the prophylactic aspects of this statute are invalid. there remains the fact that the statute covers actual constitutional violations for which you don't need any special proportionality. certainly, the government can allow the states to be sued for constitutional violations. and the plaintiff here claims that some of the acts he's seeking damages for do amount to constitutional violations. how can we possibly say that that suit does not lie?
mr. phillips, the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injuries." you didn't want the direct relationship, you didn't ask for that. you asked for one that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to his injury." now you are saying that that was  what you asked for was an incorrect charge.
yeah, the word "knowingly."
okay. the standards are that a prisoner must file within a reasonable time. and that requires a two-part inquiry, justice o'connor. the first part is, was there substantial delay? it's determined based upon a set standard, when the delay begins. but california's never articulated any standards for what period of time constitutes "substantial." that's the first problem. it's essentially an ad hoc determination that's made by individual california courts. and that's why former justice brown described that as "an abstraction," and former justice moss described it as "vague and indeterminate at its very core." but that's what the ninth circuit is dealing with when it reviews these cases. so, to put it context for a moment, the way the state courts do enforce this on a case-by-case basis, to be practical, is, the state supreme court often summarily dismisses cases on procedural bars, including timeliness. and, to give you some statistics from the warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,223 unexplained summary denials  in other words, just denied  and there were 1,174 denials with a citation to a case. and this is significant, because this means that, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to the california supreme court, they enforced one of their procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was timeliness.
yes, it  it discriminates and it  it has an exclusory effect on trucks  out-of-state carriers that want to compete in the  and bring their trucks across the  the border of michigan and compete against local carriers for intrastate hauls.
i wonder if you could focus on one question for me. if you have a state law cause of action and the law to be applied to some aspects of that cause of action is federal law, is that sufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction or not?
what does the government contend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation of section 3729 is committed?
it would, your honor.
it assumes, i think, that  that the  it assumes the correctness of the judge's  of the trial court's assessment of the facts rather than simply accept the  the jury's verdict for what it was because, again, as a matter of washington law, mr. recuenco could be found guilty of assault two with a deadly weapon even if he used what appeared to be a handgun, absent some proof of capacity. and again, as a matter of  of sixth amendment jurisprudence, even had the state put together evidence establishing the capacity of the instrument to fire, the jury would have been free to return a verdict on the lesser offense of deadly weapon, even if it were to contradict washington law on that point. the jury would 
 the jury doesn't have a free-falling moral judgment to make. it accepts the judgment of the majority of the people in kansas that certain aggravators, and only those aggravators, shall be counted against the defendant 
oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.
i agree.
well, the question is whether the state can compel us to, to obtain that authorization for this limited type of speech.
that's correct, your honor. but in addition to all of that, the state court was looking at penry and graham when they decided this case and there was no penry ii yet. there was no tennard or smith. and so it was reasonable for them to compare the evidence, the weight of that evidence, the strength of that evidence, to those cases and decide that it fell on the graham and johnson side of the line rather than the penry side of the line. that's the only thing they could do at the time.
rogers said, in whole or in part. now, i agree with you, that i don't see how that does it. but rogers said that it did it.
and it 
well, what i  what i tried to say, justice breyer  maybe i should change my answer to no. what i tried to say is  is that the facts at the  at  that are involved in the creation of the joint venture  all of them can be considered as part of a rule of reason analysis. but what i tried to go on to say to justice scalia was no one doing that rule of reason analysis would care about what the specific price is. that isn't what they would look at. what 
that  justice scalia, that's not what i said. the question was asked about a post, like a bridge, the pilings for a bridge. in certain cases, depending on the size, it might result in a discharge. i'm not saying every  a stick in the river is, certainly not a swimmer. we have a de minimis rule. we're not saying that. it needs to be 
 automatically.
yes, for purposes of jurors  at jury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it would be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely 
and on your reading of 1367, there's the  the  there's no accommodation for that. so you'd either have to have the whole lawsuit in the courts of puerto rico or you'd have  let the child sue in the federal court and the parents would have to bring a separate suit?
well 
 then i would say that it is waived, if it's been answered 
this is a different question. we've been talking about willful up to now.
and 
 operation rescue did the same kind of thing now that they did then, the petitioners in  the plaintiffs in this case would be able to get relief under that statute. is that right or wrong?
if he, if he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to go outside the government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then i suppose that there would not be standing. but i think 
chickasaw said when the tax was imposed on the tribe, we would take the state at its word. it said it's taxing the tribe. if the state put the tax on a non-indian, then there would be balancing. and that's what chickasaw 
well 
it was, but the case has been relied on by several subsequent decisions including in the second circuit in the attica case, inmates of attica, for the proposition that there is just simply no right to an enforcement against somebody else, that there is no entitlement. now, i'm not saying that the colorado legislature never could create such an entitlement, but given the backdrop of linda r.s., and also given the backdrop of traditional law enforcement discretion, i think we need a much clearer statement from the colorado legislature itself, both that it's written in terms of the beneficiary  getting her an entitlement against the police, rather than in terms of what the person restrained is.
the evidence  i see my time is up. little me briefly answer this question. or  i want to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal. very quickly, the overt act has to refer to the attempting to enter the dwelling. and so 
yeah, but the revenue  the revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-extraterritorial enforcement. it has  it has other rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue rule is; the  you know, the problems of policy; there are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we certainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on. it's not just extraterritoriality. and those  those policies would be just as much implicated by the  by the restitution as by the out-and-out enforcement in justice breyer's example.
 was conceded in this case, that there's the effect on the competition. there are two separate things. there is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored dealer. in respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that doesn't count. i'm not focusing on that. i am focusing upon the truck that he did not purchase. the reason that the disfavored dealer did not purchase that truck is that he had a rival  maybe there's only one case of it, but there's at least one  he had a rival, the favored dealer, who got the purchase. he got the order from the customer, and then ordered the truck. now, in that one, i take it, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored dealer.
yes.
that's right.
can you tell me, how is race used? do the administrators have discretion in the weight they will give to it on a case by case basis?
i don't know, i don't know what municipalities can do in new york. you say they've got to have a good reason. i assume you're referring to new york law for that purpose.
 the same way 
yes, your honor.
your honor, that is correct.
if  if the question you're asking me is what does it mean to probate a will 
well, your honor even if that is a case that would be removed without jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this case because this case 
yes, your honor.
it's also critical here to your case that it was a school event. if it, if this had have been two blocks down the street there would have been no objection.
i think the only point i would make there is this court said in strickland that counsel should consult with their  with their client, with the accused, and that that's an obligation on counsel. if there was a failure to consult, perhaps that would be argued that that failure to consult was deficient performance.
yes.
thank you, counsel. mr. srinivasan.
for each  any claim that you're raising, yes. it goes claim by claim.
justice stevens, there is certainly  government has demonstrated by  or congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in certain cases. however, i return to my original argument that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party refund suits, and if congress has not made 7426 exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to coexist. this court has held on other occasions that it will not preempt statutes without a very clear expression from congress. and congress, once again, knew how to do it after the williams case.
that was part of that. that was  that was one of the  was it one of three aggravating circumstances?
were you taking a position on this issue prior to the election time frame?
 on the advertising, itself.
i don't understand that.
all right, cattle, then 
no. i didn't say  i wasn't suggesting that. abela is one case stating one position. mckenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.
now, congress has said that  the doctor, you can achieve that result through method a, but not through method b, and you're saying congress had good reason for doing that. i take it congress also agrees that if method b, which they don't want, were to be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the constitution would require it being done. i didn't see anything here about congress disagreeing with that.
well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark. you have to  it depends how big the words "best buy" were in relation to the word "mark's electronics."
but, but juries don't look at punitive damages in terms of a multiple. they are not asked to multiply anything and they shouldn't be. they are looking at the misconduct. they are looking at how you deter others from similar misconduct. they are looking at profitability here which is a statutory requirement to them.
why should  why should they put in strickland evidence if they've won under cronic?
did congress intend to cover, which i guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution. their children hire a companion to look after them. now, that's a third party.
this case would necessarily impair the validity of the conviction. if 
well, but at some point in the statute, congress has to give an indication of their intent, and this is where it is. for example, there's another limitation immediately following it which says it shall also not include any state offense which is described as a misdemeanor in the state and carries no more than 2 years.
that's right, justice ginsburg, and in part, that's because of the historical chronology. the word located was first used in 1887 and the current version of section 1348 was enacted in 1948, which was 10 years before the concept of principal place of business had any jurisdictional salience. that was the first time that congress  this was in 1958  that congress enacted a specific provision dealing with corporate citizenship, and that's the first time that we see the concept of principal place of business having relevance in the jurisdictional context.
well, and 
it says "dmt." and then it has another  and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says "dmt," means what it says: you can't import dmt. it's a drug importation statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the substance dmt. otherwise, we'd have  throw out bananas and  or mimosa, anyway. and we're not looking to intent on that. now, that's a possible interpretation that doesn't contradict anything. and 
mr. johnson, your  your citation of the  of the portion of the  of the trial court opinion, which says that there was no corroboration of the  of the confession, that was not stated in  to say, and therefore, the confessions were weak evidence. that point was made in order to say, therefore, the confession cannot be admitted because the  the rule was it's hearsay, but hearsay that's corroborated can be admitted. so i think you're misdescribing the 
the government is wrong. it continued.
you conceded that out.
it would  could.
the line that has been drawn by the department of labor, is where i will start, and the department of labor  and let me give you some citations  says that the line is between whether the employer requires you to do the donning and doffing on the plant or not. the citations for that are section 785.24(c) of the regulations, 790, note 65. and then it contrasts clothes-changing that's by your own choice, in 790.7(g). i think that's a sensible line, but it's not presented by this case. justice breyer, it goes to your characterization of the final sentence of footnote 49, and that is: sometimes. the reason i think it's sensible to draw the line that the department has in required clothes changing is that the employer will only require you to do it onsite if it is truly integral and indispensable to your job; otherwise, it'll be optional, or they'll let you do it at 
that would arguably be the case if on remand the court of criminal appeals had applied procedural default and refused to consider the case  the claim, but not what it did.
well, i think it's a common practice in those circuits which have indicated that a 50(b) motion is required to preserve all rights to appellate review. whether or not it is the common practice in other circuits where that is not required, i'm not sure. certainly 
but it  it's not just sales. it's always been lost profits, as well. and if we are paying more, we're losing money, vis-a-vis our competitors. and then every day after that, we're competing with our  one arm tied behind our back because we have less money. and is there any reason to doubt that 
 required.
okay, but 
i'm not sure that would apply to other states.
and if there's this initial review, he says, you know, i think it's really pretty incomplete until you do x, y, z, please do it over again, is that a violation of the rule?
well, the  the stated aggravating circumstances didn't, but the point of  one point of the argument is that by shackling the man in  in this complete and visible way, you are creating the impression that no one could fail to  to perceive that this guy is so dangerous that they can't even depend upon courtroom security either to protect him from the  protect the jurors or courtroom personnel or to prevent escape. that  excuse me. that may not be a verbal argument about dangerousness, but it seems to me that it is an unmistakably visible one. what is your response to that?
well 
thank you, mr. hungar. mr. coughlin.
you  you go and you fill out a form that says, as this case did  and it's on page 4 of our brief 
we 
okay.
well, if the motion is reserved, and the court has declined to rule on it, then the  it would seem to me that it follows that the court can grant that motion.
but the attorney general's directive, if i remember it, does not identify any particular controlled substance. it just identified a particular kind of conduct by the doctor.
would it 
to get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to mr. tager's point that that's difficult to  what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company? is that covered by the commerce clause cases or not?
it is  yes, your honor, that's the shorthand of rule 11.
but you did use the word inquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it seems. this is not a magistrate judge or a police officer coming to a person for an interview. this is initiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's initially a cry for help.
isn't it  i'm sorry. go ahead.
 that's absolutely correct, that this court 
don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?
i must say that  that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.
he did not make it, but you assume that the judge did by granting the motion, and nobody else said anything about it anyway. i reserve the time.
but what about  i think the principal argument that ms. bergmann made was your reading means people  you're encouraging filings that inevitably will be thrown out because the right will be made retroactive?
i would agree with that, your honor.
he's not been sentenced yet, your honor. and he was explicit throughout. he also said  he never testified that he even thought that an sec proceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it was possible. nor did he say that he ever consciously tried to hide the truth or hide the facts. what he did say is that, "yes, part of what was on my mind at the time that i asked for compliance with this policy was that the sec and others might want to look at these files someday, and i'd better get them in compliance with our retention policy, because i know that drafts and notes are the kinds of things that could be misused and misconstrued at some point in the future." that was the basis of his guilty plea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case. and the government's interpretation, the instructions that were given to this jury, deprived the term "corruptly persuade" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning. under the government's view, for instance, of "corruptly," bribery becomes irrelevant under this statute. i mean, if you look at this statute, and you say, "what was congress trying to prohibit here when it says"  it's a got a list of wrongful means of interfering with witnesses. it says "intimidate" and "threaten" and "use of physical force," and it says "corruptly persuades." the first thing that would come to your mind is bribery. but bribery is irrelevant under the government's interpretation, and let me explain why. because they say that, "well, yes, it's true, it says'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you  is if you had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a proceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking. it doesn't matter whether you used any money  monetary compensation in order to extract this behavior; you're automatically guilty. but if you use bribery 
i don't understand your response to me about vastly different standards of review. i would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to get judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.
yeah 
that's the way you would phrase the 
let me take the first question first, and then i'll address the second one. there were three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the negligence of the railroad. not just that the one driver drove the other driver off the side of the road. there was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given adequate safety instructions. and there's no way, given that this was a general verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that theory might line up with a causation theory, based on the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's arguments in this particular case. so it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, and that's it. they were more theories in it. and you know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to official me the answer is there's no way for the court to make a harmless error determination. it is also a question of state law. it ought to be decided by the missouri courts in the first instance in any event, i would think, rather than this court trying to sort through the record. with respect to the argument at the close of the case, i don't remember any specific arguments that either side made with respect to the burdens, because the jury instructions were what they were. and i think each side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything wrong. and so that's basically the way that it was presented. but i think given the way the jury instructions played out, that there's no way at this time to unscramble that.
they routinely take appointments. they are on a list of 
well 
and so you're arguing not only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient to prove a violation, but it also was not even an anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?
it does not 
mr. flaxman, one starting point. you say that this case should be just like heck, but in heck the core problem was the line between 1983 and habeas, right?
preclusion.
 to get them all through the holmes 
absolutely not.
in any event, the difference between getting the  the complaint dismissed on the pleadings or having to wait for a  a 12(b)(6) motion because as soon as you, you know, ask for the  the proof of the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to have, if  if your analysis of the case is correct, you're entitled to have the drop in  in the value of the stock shown.
you were not considering that.
reluctant or not, that witness can be  can be subpoenaed.
he did? where is that?
the case is dismissed.
 for rebuttal.
 california is a "weighing" state 
no. that tension that you  that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a result of the fact that the antitrust rule  law does not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. it prohibits agreements that are anti  that restrain competition. and so it will often be the case that it is possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that line because of a different value, a value in preserving the independent action of individuals. it is, however 
that 
well, no, that's not 
yes, your honor. he  the prosecutor, in fact, stipulated to the admissibility of the eastman and the wesley evidence from wesley's trial back into the stumpf proceeding in the original trial court before the two judges  the two of the three judges that were remaining at that point, and then 
that's what we're asking.
i'm sorry, i'm not sure what your honor 
it could not follow this court's dicta under this court's statement in williams v. taylor that only the holdings, not the dicta, of this court establish clearly  clearly establish supreme court authority. i believe that the rule, if there's going to be one, should be the rule that was applied here. a general rule of fundamental fairness considering the totality of the circumstances before the trial court. i think the rule works. and it worked in this case.
in this case, it's our position that the legislature has done so as well.
 may congress, consistent with the establishment clause, say that we will create an exception for peyote, but not for this other church, which has far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been found to be a genuine religion? the problem of preferring one religious group over another, it seems to me, arises once there is an exception for the native american church. and i heard you say, "well, the indian tribes are special," but is that  that's it. it would have to be 
this is a layperson. he said, "i tripped in the intermediate appellate court, because i didn't do any research. and so, i wanted to do better, but they gave me a job where, during the hours that the library was open" 
is that a reasonable proposition?
as long as they're not in jail pending trial.
the slightest cause.
where there's not sufficient evidence in the record to go to the jury under the proper jury instruction, the proper outcome is for the claim to be dropped from the case.
that's correct, and oftentimes, trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology. the fact is it is suggestive because "micro colors" is the protected trademark here.
yes. that would be my preferred instruction on remand, yes.
okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple. would you have any objection on establishment clause grounds?
why can't they just have an order to the bankrupt  to disclose the asset in the chapter 13 proceeding?
but that doesn't  but that 
mr. waxman.
 nothing in the act that prevents the universities 
i think 
but i take it congress did not refer specifically to  or did not include a specific authorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little construction to get to your point.
 operating it in perpetuity.
 which took the view that the court should, in any event, retain the presumption where a patent is being used to impose a variable or a requirements tie. do you have any comment on that view?
in the government, you're including the court in that.
what if the defect that he identified turns out to be entirely different? what if there is no dispute, it's completely different from the defects that led to the false claims on which there were recovery?
it's a merger of both principles, as this court said 
justice scalia, you're correct, and that's precisely why they have 
thank you. thank you, mr. draper.
i know i could find this out by looking at a calendar. do you remember what day of the week february 24th was, or 26th?
well, a narrow, targeted  i guess the point is, your honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation would be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus approach to accommodation.
yes, but i don't think i'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty. and i don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed. it could say there was a serious risk of it.
what i'm saying, it seems to me that the government speech doesn't seem to me to advance your argument very much, because it has problems of its own.
do you think there's a realistic possibility that this person is going to be readmitted? a realistic possibility?
 would allow complete chaos.
thank you, mr. hungar. mr. goldstein.
 that it's up to the states, i take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth amendment.
that's  on the basis of the record then before it.
well, don't worry about it. (laughter.)
 get a fair  because any judge can make a mistake 
what of mr.  mr. moran's point that this  whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's  it conclusively determines the issues presented?
well, i would think 
okay. and that's  i don't know that justice brennan's citation to coray, or coray's use of the language carries you any further than that. but that's as far as mr. phillips wants to go.
and so, for example, if 
 wasn't the only one.
they may, but that wasn't a definitive ruling. so do you agree that if we accept the position that you are taking, a remand would require for that  for that evidence to be considered on the straightforward question did counsel perform adequately?
promptness. and i think that the united states has told us it's generally done here somewhere between 24 and 72 hours. a suspect who has been given miranda warnings as here  the conversation with the police, the interrogation, could begin before that 24 hours or 72 hours expires.
all right. then where does your efficacy criterion go? you're saying they may make judgments, and apparently they may  may make judgments and maintain them even if those judgments do not, in fact, advance their interests. here, you're saying they  it's not going to advance their interests, so they can't do it. in these cases, you're saying they don't advance their interests, but they can as a matter of judgment. and i don't know how to draw that line.
do you think that the 
one 
 a favored purchaser that is the effect of such 
in 1996, we had a conclusion of an ocr title ix investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. so we  we know about ocr, and they're in atlanta. they are about 167 miles away and when  and when they come, they come, your honors. if i may, i'd like to get right now to what i had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title ix for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. he's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.
i think there's  i mean, there's  the constitution is  has no difficulty with such a statute. it is this statute. as i say, there's  if you want to think about it being preferential entry into campus, and then, at that point, equal access on terms of the  the terms that are extended  however you want to think about it, though, there's no difficult constitutional question here.
since they have not contested our pl-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the reply brief, we have never had to face this question because there has been no question that we are pl-110 resettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our identity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike totten, there is no state secret that is  is at risk.
but 
what  well, what is your answer 
i'm saying less. less. it  there's less of a divergence under the new map than there was under the old one. the only difference is this divergence is in favor of the majority.
right. but the fact of  let me  i think we've got a terminological problem  the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of aggravated murder is not tantamount, as i understand it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be considered at the penalty phase have also been found. is that 
yes. we believe that that's  we're entitled to do that to rebut 
and if you wanted a cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection (7) of the corps' regulations where they have no interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the united states. if they act in the way that you've been postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they don't.
well, i guess a litigant can read decisions from other courts, as a lawyer can.
first, they have to be convicted, justice scalia, of capital murder.
but you're still asking us  i 4 mean, even  even in your fall-back position  your  5 your principal position asks us to  to play games with 6 the  with the word facts, and your fall-back position 7 asks us to play games with the word discovered. you want 8 us to read discovered to mean either discovered or 9 obtained, which discovered just doesn't mean obtained. it 10 just doesn't.
it is not pure form. any  what  what congress did was say that in order to qualify a carrier  they were concerned about the burdens. when istea was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the burdens on carriers of individual state registration requirements. and they sought to  to alleviate that by making it so that carriers could only  would only have to register in one state so they could do business in all states on an interstate basis.
well the conviction generally does stand with  the battery generally has nothing to with the conviction.
we don't know that. it seems likely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad thing. leegin is obviously not dominant in the market. it's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is offering at a higher price is what consumers want, and that is a good thing under the antitrust laws.
thank you, mr. olson. the case is submitted.
so that you're saying we cannot  no court can decide definiteness in this situation without hitting the patentable issue.
so do you concede that if shall means shall, that it creates a property interest?
but then 
thank you, counsel. mr. steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 in the first instance 
and this is liability for what? in  for 
or do you take the position that they're free to impose shackles in every case, even a traffic offense, if the prosecutor wishes to do it, without any justification? that's your position apparently.
mr. stewart, let me just be sure i understand. in the government's view, is it a personnel action or is it not?
i don't know if it's exactly the status. for instance, in a settlement after litigation has been filed, i think that lear would say that you can't even repudiate that. but certainly  so, there might be some differences  but from 
i'm not talking about future dangerousness. i'm talking about  i would be repeating myself. you've taken that, i'm not talking about future dangerousness. the jury's decided that matter in your favor. i'm saying does texas law allow  you understood what i said, didn't you?
that would be fine if burglary were the only thing that congress said there, but it also said extortion. and i think it absolutely fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically  characteristically  involves a risk of physical harm. i just don't think it does.
well, your honor, we disagree with that for, it seems to me, at least three reasons. the first is that at the time the client entered into the fee agreement, he certainly had control then. he had complete control over his cause of action. he was 
 well, they do today, i'm sure, but  [laughter.]
thank you, mr. machat, the case is submitted.
and if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment. now, it may be that administratively this is just too expensive. that may be  that may be a very valid argument. but so far as saying that there's no basis for apportionment, i didn't understand your answer.
and that's my threshold 
yes, there would be standing objection  objections at that point, but we think, in terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a person would have a first amendment objection to paying an excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis in cases like abood and keller, which have to do with private association  an association with private speech 
no, because it has no morally-based, conscious-driven reason for refusing to disseminate that message.
it's their argument anyway. let them 
that was essentially done at the public records hearing on december 19th whenever they came in and said it was  that it was sims.
well, the party is here because it has the  the possibility, for those who are not voting, of changing the elections of the candidates. and i think also by 
oh, yes. they  they searched the individuals. they  they  you know, they completely made sure that  that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. there was nothing on the individuals. there was nothing that  that could cause them danger. and  and the jury, i think, was entitled to  to look at those facts and  and to hear the facts and to see the facts 
it certainly approaches that, but again, what we would maintain is there probably has to be more than simple shouting. if  if it's accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence, then certainly they could go in.
absolutely not, because they're not making the decision that's required at the selection stage. and to follow up on something that general kline said during his argument, that the provision is for a hung jury, there's no provision for a hung jury in the event the jury finds itself in equipoise. the only provision for a hung jury, under the kansas statute, is if the jury is unable to reach a verdict. but equipoise, does not prevent a death verdict. in fact, the statute requires a death verdict if the jurors are in equipoise.
i see.
it's ordered.
okay.
well, there's a lot in that question. let me just try to address it one step at a time. with respect to whether it attaches new legal consequences, i think you were right, justice breyer, earlier, in asking about what would happen if he had gone back voluntarily. now, it's true that if he had been removed, then there would have been the consequence, in the sense that there would be a period of inadmissibility, at least presumptive inadmissibility, a period, which, by the way, is subject to waiver, which he could apply for. but if he had just gone back voluntarily after iirira's enactment, or, indeed, in the 6-month window between iirira's enactment and iirira's effective date, my understanding is that there would have been no presumptive period of inadmissibility.
it's just limited to terrorists, convicted terrorists.
that is correct.
but you had already drawn the line at a different place than justice breyer suggested because in response to justice scalia, you said if it  if it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff for narcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissible search.
youth was the central point of johnson, but graham involved youth and a distinctly troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases. and so if that evidence was relevant within future dangerousness and did not amount to eighth amendment error, then this evidence has to be just as relevant. and in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of this because we are looking at the state court's decision under aedpa.
well, mr. van amberg, is the statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest? it says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile of local education agencies, does it?
if he'd entered this order on february 12 or 13  i forget which day it was  the appeal would have been timely?
yes.
but it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.
it  i haven't mentioned it. i'll take this opportunity to mention it, justice ginsburg, because it is a very important point. we know that in the statute  (a)(4) we're talking about  section (a)(3)  these are numberings before 2005 amendment to the act. the language stayed the same. the numbers were  are different. but there are two that work together. the (a)(3) priority for wages for the employees and the 
i suppose you can do that under modern computer technology. you couldn't have done it 20 years ago.
if you have an enforcement proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether or not the agency's interpretation is consistent with the statute with chevron deference and so forth and the court looks at it and says, you know, i have a real problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic statute when it first issued the regulation, the court can't get into that merely because the parties didn't present it earlier?
you don't  you don't have to define what  everything that's necessary. all you have to define is one indispensable element. and all you're arguing is that a hydrological connection is an indispensable element, whatever additional elements 
but isn't that something that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree with them on brooke group, we've got to do it in the course of making a choice between a brooke group instruction and something else, and the only something else we've got right now is what we have in this case and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that is good enough.
i don't remember.
with  with violent words, generally not, though if it's accompanied with a show of immediate force or violence, then yes, in that situation. in this situation, i believe that officers could have entered prior to the punch being thrown. what they witnessed is  is this violent struggle between four adults and a teenager. they had no idea whether or not they were trying to molest the  the teenager or whether the teenager was an intruder or what happened. but they could tell that it was violent. they knew that alcohol was involved based on the circumstances as they approached.
that's certainly possible. i just wonder why don't we look and see what they intended, since they told us. in the conference report, they say the conferees intend the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding. so why are we metaphysically trying to guess what congress intended when they told us what they intended?
the reason they don't believe you is because you're willing to take the money. what you're saying is, "this is a message"  [laughter.]
you can write them a letter and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; i want you to see the whole list here and i'd like you to do something about it. and if they don't do anything about it, you go to your senator. maybe you can go to the newspapers. i mean, has any of that happened here?
would you say the same thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 19 on page 9? the bottom of page 9, it seems to me ms.  ms. nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16. they're talking about 16 and 6, and then ms. nachman ends by talking about juror 19. that seems to me clearly to mean number 16.
no. and the courts of appeals that have considered that question likewise hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable decision appealable under waco or not. but  but that issue is not presented. but what is significant is that had congress intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of post-removal events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that congress believed that in the absence of that provision, the court would have been limited to two alternatives. authorize the joinder  or deny the joinder, or dismiss the case.
well  i mean, sandoval is very clear. it's a very clear opinion in my view. very clear. and the key language i thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. so they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority  i was in the dissent  did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. i can understand that. but i apply the same  i didn't agree with it, but i can understand it. the  the  i apply the same reasoning here. the reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. this is about victims. retaliation and being fired is about victims. and so given sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from sandoval. and all that suggests  it goes into 1681(a), in which case sandoval says, a private right of action, given cannon, would be inferred. now, what's  what's  that's how  i'm tracing out the logic of the thing. so i want to see what you say.
well, your 
in this case, notwithstanding the limitation of in section 271(f) that the components, there's  liability of the components are created here, and reassemble the broad. the federal circuit held that foreign made tangible reproductions of computer operating code installed in foreign-made computers may be components which are deemed or essentially supplied from the united states, because copying is part and parcel of software distribution, and thus subsumed in the act of supplying. under this ruling, u.s. companies may be held liable for patent infringement whenever their products are copied or replicated abroad. this  the court of appeals decision and the position of respondents requires reworking several words in the statute. the statute says supplied from the united states. the court of appeals said, well, it might be deemed supplied from the united states after it's copied abroad. the respondent takes the words "such components" in the statute and reads them as not the same components.
 text and still be holistic?
absolutely not, because under tinker that is political expression. let me be very specific. this case is ultimately about drugs and other illegal substances.
and that language has to be read against the backdrop of the holding of kosak, which recognized that when you have exceptions that are written in these broad terms, the form of the injury, the particular type of personal injury  there, it was property injury  that ensues doesn't change whether the exception applies. motor vehicles are different. if you're rear-ended by a truck, you don't jump out and say, "hey, you negligently transmitted the mail." you say  you jump out and you say, "you didn't  your brake lights weren't working," "you didn't signal." those are  there are not judgments about the handling of the mail being made that the claim arises out of. you're not suing about how we handled the mail; you're suing about how we handled motor vehicles. yes, at 
i think that's what this court has said. the other thing i want to get back to is the question about the length of jury deliberations. sure, this was really wrong. now, they changed forepersons in midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction repeated. who knows what happened. but what i will not concede  i will concede it's long, but i will not concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations says anything about if this one particular error in applying a balancing test substantially affected the verdict. i think the length of deliberations is so incredibly speculative.
why wouldn't there be an assignment? why, why would the prior owner have any  any interest in not assigning it?
 but what does on account of modify?
but the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.
it  it would not, your honor, in this instance because the  the operation of that statute does not affect their right to reimbursement under their contract provision. it affects the 
to put in 
it's in our appendix, page  the appendix to our brief, i'm sorry, the appendix to our brief, page 2 and 3.
well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted ira's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. that's my best guess.
it's final as far as the application for state review is concerned.
see? and, as justice scalia indicates, the coa is a jurisdictional requirement.
you think that under this instruction, a kansas juror could say, "you know, i'm not interested in deliberating more. i'm not going to participate"? that's what you're want  that's what you want us to believe, right, based on this argument? i  that's just  any juror  any jury can ignore its instructions. there's nothing i can do about that.
your honor, it's  it would not throw a monkey wrench because it's exactly what happened in prima paint. in prima paint, this court started off and before it enforced the arbitration act, before it got into what it called the main issue and started talking about what does section 4 mean, this court first went and did the entire interstate commerce analysis. this court said, we've got to figure out if we're in section 2 first and described that. it's not the monkey wrench. it's exactly what's happened. and in the efabco case, it was a issue for the court. to say that now, whether or not section 2 exists except for the assent agreement, but everything else about a contract and everything else about interstate commerce would suddenly be for the arbitrator, that is an exact shift from what this court did in prima paint, and it's a shift from what chief justice warren burger said in the  in the southland case, that this is a prerequisite.
mr. chief justice, the voluntarily provides prong requires the relator to be honest and truthful and submit all the information he has. and mr. stone did that and the government has never said otherwise. in fact, he met with the fbi agent 
well, district 23 was created by the balderas court pursuant to a finding under section 2. so it was a remedial district under section 2 when it was created in 2001. and in 2002, when it was used as a remedial district, it  it elected a latino-preferred candidate in 13 out of 15 elections, according to the state's expert, and came very close to unseating congressman bonilla. the state's response was essentially to punish latino voters for voting against congressman bonilla by slicing them out of the district. so the state used race to achieve its end of  of incumbency protection.
he can't do that under the 
 the more that the  the questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to think that it serves, in addition to its protection purpose, an evidentiary purpose. i'd hasten to add, justice scalia, that that kind of information is very important for the officers to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to respond effectively. so it is reasonably necessary for those kinds of questions and that information to be elicited. but i also agree with your honor's suggestion that not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be regarded as per se non-testimonial. not everything that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded as per se non-testimonial. and naturally, the court is going to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to the actual questions and answers that are given. but if you look at the protocol in this case for the 911 call, if you look at the kinds of questions that were asked and the information that was given, it is all reasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a person who has really called in a state of extreme stress. thank you.
would have to 
so that would not be good enough, but are you saying that this is worse because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards specification. and the specifications that they have made affirmatively show that they don't have enough for the agreement.
 or at least your opportunity is.
well, your honor 
no. it  it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. the second hearing was still wrong.
 that are no good, but there are other matters that are perfectly okay.
well, yes. i  i am  i am saying that 
what do you mean by connected? is it  i got  i'm getting the sense that you think it's enough that he says, look, rockwell is just lying to the government in this area, and you say well  what if what if you added a count in your complaint when you intervene on tax fraud? you found out also that they didn't pay taxes. would he be able to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes. is that sufficiently connected?
mr. casey, was it a younger abstention 
does ferc 
 message of the property tax is, "pay the  pay for the" 
yes. well, not only that, if the state's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the state could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts. you can't have the waiver of the filing fees. in fact, the state could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.
did he  did he make that suggestion or did the other  did kansas make that suggestion?
it's  it's one possibility. isn't that all?
well, whether there is a difference or not, justice alito, the point is the union here is using this money for purposes that it has every reason to believe is in the interest of the vast majority of teachers, including 
that  that situation would not fall within the emergency rule that the government is arguing for today. what we're arguing for is a rule that deals when people's safety is 
the california courts 
i think when we talk about the burden of proof, we're talking about the essential elements of the claim, whether there's been a violation. so i think 
and you say dr. bigbee discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.
what is your definition of the test under 15(c)(2)? i mean, on the one side, the argument is  felix's argument is, it's the entire trial episode, right?
but you 
and it was widely publicized among the judiciary then.
it might be part of the picture of what this person is like.
well, i  i think the point is probably both would have some kind of claim in that i don't think the state can pursue and convict two people on necessarily inconsistent theories because at that 
the argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use  growing for personal use, under prescription 
so their, their rights  so their right to proceed in federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?
it could be. but it could be a different trial, such as we would propose in this case 
secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the veterans administration. the veterans administration had to reprogram. from where? we don't know, but the veterans administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the congress for that reprogramming action. congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. there is no protection for inherent federal functions. it may have come from some other hospital budget. it may have come from some other activity of the veterans administration. no doubt everything the va does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. there is no rule that has an iff exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the national chamber explains. secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. this court's decision, justice brandeis' decision for the court, in sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. there was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. we understand that the contractor was on notice. everything is square. here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and i'd like to give the court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the government had to do it. just as in blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. but then there's a remedy. where could the money have come from? in 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the cherokee contractor. no other contractor was apparently shorted. there was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. there was 55  $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. there was $25 million in inherent federal functions. they couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? not that they had to. they could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. that was their decision. but the contractor didn't take the risk that the secretary would say, at the end of the day, i've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. no contractor takes that risk in dealing with the government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. there is no limitation to the secretary's theory in this case. the secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the secretary. well, the secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now i've made my decision and i've made my judgment. i don't have enough money to pay you. there's no limit here on contract support costs. it could be the secretarial amount. they could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. and we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. now, that's not what the  that's not what the statute permits. that sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. with regard to the tenth circuit decision, justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the tenth circuit. there was a declaration in the tenth circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. so for all these reasons, we believe the tenth circuit decision should be reversed and the federal circuit decision affirmed. unless the court has more questions.
he will get the  there is a form that is completed, a long form that is completed by the prison officials that basically stipulates the predicate act or the predicate acts that really result in the reclassification action.
yes, but we are not a court of first view and you know that very well. we are a court of review. so no matter how well it's been aired, we wait to see what the lower courts have said on a question. we don't take it in the first instance.
maybe i'm not  i thought  are we in the world in which you agree the government can do it even though their reason  or is your basic argument, no, they can't do this at all? in which case it's not a compensation question. it's a question of whether the constitution of the united states forbids them from doing it. period.
your honor, i think the alternative that the state proposes presents an even more troubling illustration. a district court, of course, can proceed at its own  at its own rate, grant a stay, grant the terms of the stay as it sees fit, and i believe that takes care of the consideration that  that your honor's question indicated, justice kennedy. the suggestion of the state sets up a situation where, according to the state, they want rhines to purge his  his claim  his petition of the unexhausted claims and proceed in state court at the same time, which is unseemly to have mr. rhines proceeding on 27 exhausted claims in federal court at the same time that he is proceeding on 8 claims in state court. now, south dakota is a little bit unique. it  it allows a second state habeas action. there's no time bar to a second state habeas action. in fact, the south dakota legislature has made a policy decision that indigent prisoners are entitled to representation of counsel in their first habeas.
are you going to address the mid-con question?
the absolute immunity, justice souter, that i'm most familiar with would be prosecutorial immunity. i think there can still be exceptions for prosecutorial immunity. i think a prosecutor, depending upon the type of actions he's engaged in, can still be subject to liability.
that certainly changes the argument. so the notice of appeal that's filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order.
we can only charge something that's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the service that we provide.
that's correct.
weren't 112 and 101 combined at that time?
the england case held that when you're required to do two separate litigations, the first in state court and the second in federal court as a result of pullman abstention, that in the second case there would be no factual or legal issues that were decided in the state court that would be preclusive in deciding the federal 
it doesn't matter? hamburgers are just as good?
well, i think i would  i mean, i  i guess i would do two answers to that, mr. chief justice. one, i would point to the fact that, at the genesis of the harrison act, it really was displacing state medical judgments about the opium trade. i would point to two other examples, one under this statute and one other the  under the fdca. the idea under the fdca  the example that comes to mind is the fda's treatment of laetrile, that this court addressed in the rutherford decision. in that case, 17 states had made a judgment that laetrile was  could be available, for prescription use, to treat cancer. and the fda, by refusing to approve laetrile 
if  if it's the fact that you go to the web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in mcconnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they  the first thing they're going to see when they get to the web site, which i agree with you  four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad  in 3 of the 12  it says, befair.org, visit befair.org, go to befair.org. and the first thing that they're going to see when they get to befair.org is a big headline in bold  gold  bold letters which says, feingold and kohl continue to support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees. so, in fact, if befair.org is brought into the picture, that makes this ad look much more like an effort to  to defeat senator feingold than the ad that we considered in our previous case.
but  i'm sorry. even in the case of  of housing in cells, what's the justification for it? the argument is  excuse me  on the initial intake, we don't know enough about them. well, on  on the transfer, you've had plenty of time to know about them. why is it justifiable even for 14 days on  on the transfer?
without any qualification for disability, illness. no. i just want the money. give me the money and i'll pay you 10 percent. is there any plan that works like that?
there aren't any funds that are available here in our view because 
yes, there is no statute in michigan where one can go to the judge in advance and say, "here are the facts, known to me already, before i even get to the scene, that should justify a no-knock." that doesn't exist in michigan. michigan follows richards v. wisconsin, and, in  had case law, even in advance of that, which simply said, "whether known in advance, or whether the facts occurred at the time of the execution of the warrant, if the richards exceptions are met, you can go in without knocking and announcing." so, we do follow that rule. you just simply can't get advance judicial authorization. it doesn't exist. but it is certainly permissible, and it  as mr. moran indicated, it happens on a fairly regular basis, because, unlike mr. moran, i believe the notion that  even in this case, i'm not saying there was no violation; there was a violation, because the police didn't know in advance that the defendant was sitting in a chair with the cocaine in his pocket, on the chair in front of him, and a gun by his side. i think that he would have answered the door. it's highly speculative, and somewhat fanciful, in that circumstance.
right. and  and if the court finds that the legislative history adds the clarity that the statute otherwise needed  is needed, i do not see why that would not comply with the spending clause, particularly since, your honor, this statute has been on the book for 20 years. there are dozens of opinions finding that expert fees are compensable. no spending clause argument has ever been raised in this kind of issue even though the statute has been on the books for 20 years.
they did. they received them 3 through discovery. and this is  there's some testimony 4 during  during the court proceedings, attorney dantos 5 does not have the transcript with her, and she clarified 6 in the testimony at post-conviction 
in the united states, justice ginsburg.
if, in fact, the allegation of handgun is sufficient to bring it in the context of neder, then there  there was no error at all. there would not have been a blakely violation in this case. and the wrong  the state was wrong all along to concede that there was because apprendi doesn't just involve  doesn't just say that sentencing elements are the equivalent of elements in the traditional sense. it says they're the equivalent of elements of a greater offense. and the state concedes and the washington supreme court has found that, in fact, there was a blakely violation in this case.
f 
well, it would be prohibited to tell somebody to do it.
it's on 166 of the joint appendix.
thank you, counsel. mr. kise.
well, within limits, i think that that's certainly true, mr. chief justice. but, of course, this case and many of the cases that raise this issue do not involve a situation in which the defendant is deprived of retained counsel with whom he can consult and whose strategic decisions he can control through his role as the client.
i still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. how  how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? if the  if your clients can take the money  just take the money out of the ira at any time, then why is it on account of age?
but there is no evidence of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in that case.
and the  justice alito, the government has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their charges together on mr. hamdan. at this point, that  you know, what you have before you is the charge. and that  and they've stuck with this charge, of conspiracy, which is not a violation of the laws of war. and, indeed, the  and the  it's not just conspiracy isn't, but that the commission is operating in totally uncharted waters, because it's charging a violation in a stateless, territoryless conflict, something as to which the full laws of war have never applied. indeed, justice alito, all 10 people facing military commissions today, all 10 indictments charge conspiracy right now. seven only charge conspiracy.
well, there it is, 803(1).
 decided mr. recuenco's guilt on a greater offense.
your honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area  era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests. from that, we step to the reasonableness clause. from the reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith analysis. so what we find is we're stepping further and further away from the original principle. and the  on the original principles, he was arrested without a warrant. wrong. under the constitution we have reasonableness. okay. he's arrested. was it a reasonable arrest? the court has said we generally say that if an arrest has probable cause, then it's reasonable unless there are these exigent circumstances, excessive force, et cetera. then under qualified immunity, it's even a step more attenuated, that even though there might not have been probable cause, if there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a violation, but no one is going to be liable for it.
and there, i don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law.
i was about to ask, 20.
why? i mean, the state can punish people for not doing what the law tells them to do, and here the state is saying we tell you to keep us  you keep us advised of your  your address. if you don't, i guess we could throw you in jail for half a year, but no, we're not going to do that. we're just going to say that  that your  your punishment for violating the law is that this kind of a notice will suffice.
so what we have  now, this has clarified it, but i don't know what to do. i think if i read the opinion the way you're saying, i would say the california court, which is a good court, conscientious, managing a huge system of criminal law in the state, probably bigger than the federal system, reads blakely and they see that those guidelines in california as previously understood were violated. and they're thinking, how do we maintain this system as constitutional. and therefore, they write 1261, which can be read as saying we're bookerizing it, and we come as close to booker as necessary to make it constitutional. now, that would be an understandable judicial reaction, and i can read the opinion as saying that, at which point i'm not certain what we're supposed to say, because i have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to black, in california, it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender. but i also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the california system. all right, so now what do i do?
it's just one more condition, good faith is not enough. you can have a good faith quack.
that 
well, it  it might be that there would be no justification for further evidence, but there would have to be a strickland ruling on the merits of the strickland issue, wouldn't there be?
i would hope not, justice scalia. i think 
i  i don't read the ninth circuit's opinion as saying there was no exaction. i think the ninth circuit held that the exaction was imposed by legislation rather than by an administrative proceeding, and because of that, it was subject to a different standard than exactions imposed in administrative proceedings. but i think there's no question in this case that an  an exaction was imposed and was actually paid. this is not a  this is not a case where there's an issue about whether the exaction was imposed. the issues were what standard was used to review that exaction and whether the exaction was constitutional.
yes. if this were  particularly if this were 
well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but i think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. period.
we do  our position is that they do occur when they happen and they must be filed within the limitations, yes.
can i make a suggestion as to why, even if it is covered by the treaty, it may not be a compelling state interest to comply with the treaty?
true, justice ginsburg. the difference, however, between the immunity in those cases and the type of immunity here that the court talked about in hishon  immunity for a police officer in a civil rights case with qualified immunity will depend upon a police officer's particular actions in that particular case. the police officer, in general, can be sued under section 1983. the immunity that's present here, with respect to small employers, has no relationship whatsoever to the actions of that employer. an employer who employs 12 people at most can engage in the most egregious employment discrimination and harassment possible, and the congress of the united states has said, as a policy matter, on balance we would rather accept that kind of awful conduct because we don't want to impose these burdens on small businesses.
i mean, that  that would be to overturn the reasoning of smith. it would say 
your honor 
it looks just like this monument. let's take this monument and put it in the rotunda of the court because the judges of that court choose to have it there. is that all right?
yes, that's possible.
well, does the fact that discrete or individual property rights are being affected and, indeed, taken justify some higher level of scrutiny than we would apply to general economic regulation by the state?
that  it goes to the next point, which is that there still has to be a coercive choice. you have to choose  there, they're choosing to give up constitutional rights in order to avoid jail and imprisonment, arrest and prosecution. here 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
that is 
is there any evidence that the death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in fact, had any deterrent value?
how do you tell whether it's used as a mark? i mean, is that  that certainly seems to be central. is it used as a mark? and if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.
well, that  that's 
no.
 about delivering 
that is correct.
on the whole 300,000?
i mean, i think it's clear  it  it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was advised by the flra that the grievance procedure was his available remedy and declined to invoke even the initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore 
right, but that wouldn't affect  that wouldn't override the net  the net effect on the  on the person. the  the real world effect on denise finn and other people like her would still be different.
so you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?
sure, that's another way to 
well, when you say  when you say relevant, i think that if the law enforcement officer  if  if it's a statement to a known law enforcement officer in the line of duty, it's  it's almost always going to be testimonial. if it  if it identifies the  the perpetrator or describes the crime, i would say it's clearly testimonial, or if it's in response to the  to the officer's inquiries, it's clearly 
i guess you 
so you're saying the summary judgment simply, in effect, says, "they're not doing anything wrong now, but we have left open the question, not merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but whether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward into the future"?
that's correct, justice scalia.
i thought there was something about nelson having assigned his, the right-of-way that he had to the government.
i don't agree with your earlier statement that what  what this defendant expected was a contested trial in which, you know, the state's evidence is challenged, blah, blah, blah. that's to the contrary. he said this whole thing is  is just a big railroad job and that's one reason i don't want to be there. go ahead and do whatever you want. he wasn't  he wasn't expecting  in fact, if you're  if you're talking about is subjective expectations, they would reinforce the lawyer's belief that he had no objection to conceding guilt because he was referring to this as  as one big railroad job.
 out the job duties.
why was it critical?
you've never sued a spy to  who hasn't carried out his mission?
well, justice scalia, it is the first document, which is recognized in the regulations, which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against it, the first one that's required by the regulations in order to commence the proceedings.
it was  it was the  it was a search only of premises with respect to which she had, supposedly, common rights. i mean, we take the case on that assumption.
that's correct. just as, for example, the employees did in the nffe against weinberger case on which you sat in the court of appeals where the government again there tried to argue there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court really gave that argument the back of its hand because traditionally the way that someone who wants to allege, someone who is an employee or not who wants to allege, that there  that he's seeking injunctive relief for a constitutional violation, goes to the federal district courts under 28 u.s.c. 1331, not to a negotiated grievance procedure that was not intended and cannot operate in the way that the government seems to hope 
i say, the trial court could have done that pursuant to rule 59(d) without a motion being filed.
justice  justice kennedy, we don't believe 
i didn't.
thank you, mr. kneedler. mr. olson, you have four and a half minutes left.
 in justice breyer's example.
yes, and they say sure  sure i am. i'm saying i had terms. you know, i was going to be here under conditions a, b, c, and a, b, c in my opinion mean i will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me d, e, f, and d, e, f means i'm likely to be released later. i can't guarantee it. that's what he'll say. he says i can't guarantee it, but i wouldn't be bringing this case if i didn't think at least it was a shot.
is it true that michigan is the only state in the union so far that denies counsel on a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?
thank you, counsel.
but it's not no reasonable probability, that's not the standard. the standard under smith is whether the juries can consider this mitigating evidence in some manner.
the  i'm sorry. the  the file 10 itself, the  the information the file was going to be 11 used.
if it's  if it is put into a plating charge as opposed to a registration  part of the registration of a carrier for the privilege or the opportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in the state of michigan, that is the flat fee that we're talking about. under the ssrs we believe that $100 charge exceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted. if they put it into the irp, that  irp is charged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the secretary of  paid to the secretary of state. it is not a qualification under  for the privilege of engaging in interstate trucking in the state of michigan. the ssrs sets up the standards by which a carrier becomes qualified to operate in the state. michigan exceeds those standards. if you put those fees into the irp fees, then the carrier  or then the owner of the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on his mileage in the state.
mr. katyal, you've addressed the detainee treatment act in its  in its capacity as, arguably, removing jurisdiction. might not the act also function as a retroactive approval of what the president has done?
no, it doesn't.
yeah.
and how long  do we know what the average period of incarceration in level 2 is? is it a matter of weeks, or is it a matter of years?
yeah. i see. is that clear in the  in the specific senate report that is referred to here?
i think we agree with respondent, mr. chief justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the word such communication practices. and to understand what that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and see the universe. now, the beginning of 201(a) is what we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the official act. and that's the core of 201(b), which says that when a common carrier is providing service, it needs to act justly and reasonably. here  and with accounting and rate making and all the rest, those are things that affect rates and service to customers. what we have in this case is something very different. this is a carrier-carrier relationship. so you need to look somewhere else. and what respondent says is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about physical interconnections between carriers. but the problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships are governed only when the fcc has ordered physical interconnection.
you  you made the point, in answer to justice o'connor, that a police officer in washington is not required to divulge on the spot the reason for the arrest. what is the point at which the arrestee under washington law is entitled to know the cause of the arrest?
i thought one of the objections to the sixth circuit rule from your friend was that this requirement of naming the individuals came out of thin air. and now we have that requirement articulated in the grievance policy. does that make a difference?
you're arguing a preclusion question, and if the ninth circuit thought it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say about texas law. there's no finding in this record of what texas law is other than what you have just told us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not. but the ninth circuit said the federal door is closed to this probate exception, and that's what we're here to decide.
this plan  and the federal courts have held for years school districts do have an interest in avoiding white flight. and as i said, this plan has prevented  has stopped white flight and has stabilized enrollment in our schools. but this  this plan was adopted, your honor, for the purpose of providing the compelling benefits of racial integration, some of which this court identified in grutter, some of which the district court found were not present in the university of michigan law school case, but are present in an elementary and secondary system of schools. for example, the district court found that this plan makes our public schools more competitive and attractive and results in broader community support for those schools.
well, i don't think, consistent with the position of the executive, that the geneva convention applies in this particular conflict.
well, suppose 
very well, mr. machat. now, ms. millett, we'll hear from you.
well, i think it is true that it doesn't seem to be involved in this case. in this case, we're under 4.420.
thank you, counsel.
absolutely. first of all, the  the court of appeals correctly says  in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against jackson for complaining about perceived title ix violations. but for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not  had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. he is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. he's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. and this is not a case in which  that has concern  i mean, justice kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and i understand the special sensitivity that the court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that states understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the federal funds. this is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. at that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title ix's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. we had had 30 years where both the department of education and 
no, no, no. they're going to show exactly the elements that we write in our opinion.
i  i don't  i don't understand what you just said.
that's right, cases in which there is a final csrt decision; that is, that the government's argument in the d.c. circuit, justice scalia, is that there are two different ways in which the dta truncated the review of guantanamo cases. one is the claim that the jurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases. that, we reject. that, we think the senate rejected on november 15th when it passed the bill. the other is the claim that the e(2) provision governing final decisions of csrts, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as the plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast  majority of the detainees' claims. that is the provision 
and in fact  and i  i think that would be the appropriate thing to do.
how many prisoners pay the filing fee in the first place?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
yes, although i  i certainly do not want to leave the misimpression that  and there is  there is much more.
who would they attract? they would attract libertarian-oriented people who would be drawn by their philosophy because the libertarian party, as with most minor parties, is an ideological party. they take positions oftentimes ignored by the major parties, and that is one of the reasons that 
i don't think that's the way that they're presenting their case, justice ginsburg, and this is important because what the government is saying is the right itself is not violated until we have a breakdown in the adversarial process at trial.
how  how can you reconcile that 
and  and that's quite different than sending a case to the jury.
and seizure 
involved economic activity.
now, is there any excuse they're making for that? because if you don't tell me, they're 
they've got a presence there and they're doing business there. i think they would be deemed located there.
no. under our  under our theory, the  theory, the states are bound by the automatic stay. the states are also bound by 
i still think that in this case, given the entire context and all the other reasons given, including the gender reason, that it would still  that those demeanor and youth reasons would still not be persuasive looking at the context 
that's the 
do i remember that 
there's a wide variation of privilege grants and withdrawals even at the highest levels of security. the aclu's amicus brief points to three other states that  that have the same program as pennsylvania, and frankly, i'm not even sure as to those, that it's identical. but the court has recognized that  that these sorts of variations, particularly when we're talking about high security prisoners, are precisely what turner contemplates.
 that said look for them. that's about as specific as you can get.
well, no, i don't think that that's true, and i do think that the 
well, i  i would grant you if  if they  they are so tight that it's causing pain, you've got a separate problem, but short of that, does the so-called capacity to participate suffer simply because he's  he's in irons? i mean, the only participation that he's going to do, i presume, is  is sit there and  and communicate with his lawyer. it's going to affect his capacity to write a note to his lawyer. what else is it going to do?
thank you, but apologize to him. (laughter.)
well, was there any problem of that in tennessee versus lane? i thought the courthouse officials there said, "there'll be a trial. no problem there, just whether you have to walk up the steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below." was there  it's the right of access to courthouse, specially?
is that an appropriate consideration to take into account in determining whether to grant an injunction or not?
yes.
so they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries? or what about dumping heavy metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because of what other countries do, but epa tried to regulate that. acid rain they tried to regulate. you're saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.
absolutely.
but a different theory of invalidity.
oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, i could understand it 
the history is that the board had both narrowed the use of the integration tie breaker in '99 and 2000 and then continued it for the 2001 school year. we were  in 2000-2001 school year, we were enjoined in 2001 to use it in that year, which was considerably disruptive. but the board was also, the measures that it had implemented, implementing magnet schools at rainier beach and chief south high schools in the south end, implementing it in 
if the law was so anti-removal, then one would expect there would be some kind of threshold check once you get to district court. but the removal process is: you file your notice that you're removing. that's it. there it goes. and the district court doesn't do any kind of initial screening to let it in. it just gets there 
there are any number of areas in which 
well, you're saying every  i mean, everyone got a seat in brown as well; but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race, it violated equal protection. how is your argument that there's no problem here because everybody gets a seat distinguishable?
mr. shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it? because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor. i mean, judge dawson could have said, yes, they  these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.
but again, if  if under washington law, a handgun were automatically a firearm, the instruction wasn't erroneous at all.
well, your honor, what i'm saying is, under the  under this court's jurisprudence in the first amendment, it's actually relevant whether the reason for refusing to disseminate the message lies at the heart of the first amendment.
there's a question i would like to ask you about the state. now, if everything worked ideally, it would be the police officer, along with the miranda warnings, says, would you like to call your consulate. you could do that if you wish. if it  if the state has an obligation to give this information under the treaty, but many police officers don't know anything about any vienna convention, do judges, federal judges, state judges, have an obligation, when they see that an alien defendant is before them, to, on the judge's own motion, ask the prosecutor has he been told about the vienna convention, and if not, the judge would have an obligation to do so?
he wasn't forced to go over. he did it on his own. it seems to me that's 
it doesn't require you to  to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.
right. but, justice kennedy, i  i concede that. the issue for this court is whether the constitution requires that as a matter of law, not as a matter of the application of law to a particular defendant, the line has to be drawn this way, and 
okay.
i don't think congress did intend that. when we looked 
well, the government is often quite confident that it's correct. and i think if you put yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this case, you can see why that's true. but there are myriad rules and sub-rules of substantive law that this court will never review, that require the government to conform with various pleading obligations. they're all below the radar screen. but when you have a rule of automatic reversal like this, they jump up to prominence. and the reason that they do is because the entire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the judge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors, everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was conducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply because there was a mistake at the charging phase. and the petit jury's verdict we submit makes it clear that that mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say let's throw it all out and start again simply as a prophylactic mechanism.
i  i have two comments about that. that was a position which actually a footnote in our brief in tyler against cain i think suggested, although that wasn't the issue before the court in that case. but since that time, this has been litigated in a number of courts of appeals and district courts, and as far as i'm aware, no court has accepted that. and the reason they haven't 
justice stevens 
as a matter of constitutional error, no, i don't believe it would have been. but as  but under washington law, it was a verdict they couldn't  as we know from recuenco now, it's a verdict they couldn't have returned.
 "or a car without a car seat."
one could certainly compare the preceding district, and with respect to the preceding district, the differential is  is not great. it is somewhat more compact. but there were other policy agendas the district court 
whether the people they were afraid of were  were on the premises?
what is the source of his obligation to do this? i mean, why does he have an obligation under the eighth amendment or under any other ground to tell the state how to execute people?
why do you concede that? you've got a case in which, as i understand it, not only was the evidence but the warrant itself an indication not only that drugs were present, but that guns were present. it's perfectly true we don't have a general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific evidence that there were firearms there. and based on what i've seen in the case, i don't know why michigan did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in without knocking. and i'll be candid to say you  to tell you that the fact that michigan does not make that argument suggests to me that michigan is trying to structure a case in which it's going to have the best shot to  to get the exclusionary rule out of the way here. why don't you claim that the search was lawful?
i mean, you're 
but nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.
because your reading of it requires a look at the underlying conduct. it actually requires. and the document here that was selected to exhibit the underlying conduct is as far away as you can get from an adjudicatory document.
and do you have 
and the states have immunity not just from damages but from suit.
okay.
that's right.
that's correct. and in this 
your honor, you  i think it's important to keep in mind that in this case, they have not challenged the arbitrator. the reason 
i guess it really depends on whether you think the language "if the government proceeds with an action" is equivalent to the government's bringing the action.
justice breyer, it is fair. and it's fair for this reason, that in the williams case the very 
 and  and whom you continue to pay. right?
and the jury found all five.
well, whether there was a cure, and whether he initiated, it's the state's position to be a mixed of question of fact and law. what was said is a historical fact. whether what  detective johns cured it and allowed blake to initiate should be reviewed de novo. and with respect to initiation, it's important to note that, in bradshaw, the court said that there's a two-part inquiry. you look at, one, did the defendant initiate? and, two, if he did, that's when you get to the voluntariness analysis.
i believe it intrudes on the parties' interest and work product and opinion work product and attorney-client privilege and perhaps even the defendant's sixth  sixth amendment right because it may require divulgence of those types of confidences.
right. but again, you've licensed it and there are certain rights that, obviously, arise out of the licensing. none of these factors is alone, i don't believe, sufficient to say you don't get injunctive relief. but i think what the district court said, and i think that this is why the court ought to affirm the district court's under  under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been applied to this case  what the court should say is, look, and where you have no practicing of the invention by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness to license not only to the world, but also to ebay specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary injunctive relief, under all of those  and where  and where there's serious question about the lines to be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by  in the way of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of which the district court identified, then it's not appropriate to grant injunctive relief. we'll allow enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential down the road, obviously, of  of an injunction to serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.
under that rationale, justice stevens, every time a district court judge changes his mind, after giving further thought to a case 
there is not.
but that  this is a peculiar effect on one person, but for most people 
it might be  it might be closer to that, yes. i think, again, it would depend if she was  if she was vice principal for administration or something, i think  i think it clearly would. but the purpose of the pickering line of cases is to protect employees when they go outside of their  of their job, that they shouldn't be penalized for having taken a job to be able to participate in public affairs, as the court put it in pickering. that does not suggest that the  that the employee brings the first amendment into the job workplace and can use it as a shield or a sword in the day-to-day interactions with his supervisors, and to do so would constitutionalize, as i said, the day-to-day operations of employment. and this is a classic example, where somebody wrote a disposition memorandum in the course of 
or at least where  where the limitation  you make a big point of this in your brief as  as i  as i recall. at least where the reason the candidate would have to spend so much time is the very small contribution limit established by the same statute. it's  it's rather like the  the murderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan, having killed his parents.
yes, he does generally. it doesn't give any evidence. it simply is 
the bankruptcy court did reject it, yes. but they rejected it because, as i say, up to that point the case law had held that we did not have standing to object to the claims, so we were bound by what was there.
what about oregon revised stat 163.150? it says, "in a capital sentencing proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all evidence previously offered and received may be considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing." now, that's oregon law. it's long been there. what possible reason could oregon have for having that provision, which is, "jury, you shall consider all the evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the trial"? what reason could that be? how is it supposed to be relevant, "all evidence," unless it's relevant to the question of whether there is doubt?
 not if the prisoner says, "here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption."
they've identified them all already? (laughter.)
mr. andre, didn't you have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail. then the answer attached every piece of paper that came up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, i'm going to copy all those documents and make them my own. and nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the record made it plain that there had been exhaustion. the rule that you are opposing would operate that way. if you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't matter that the deficiency has been made up by the answer. you go out. wasn't that the decision in one of these cases?
he brought two claims in his criminal case. he lost them both in the illinois circuit court at the time of his suppression motion. he pursued only one of those on appeal to the illinois appellate court, and the circuit court made findings that the confession was voluntary. so at the outset, there were problems with that claim going into federal court.
yes, i would agree.
so if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of federal bankruptcy law, the fobian rule doesn't prevent that?
that's right.
yes, your honor. well, it's kind of a combination of both. the treaty directs give effect to these rights. and we are asking the court to exercise its authority to remedy the breach because suppression is a creature of this court's authority, common law authority.
your honor, the  the state concedes that the  the prosecutor did make misstatements, but i think that the bulk  as you pointed out, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the weight to be attributed to payton's mitigating evidence, and actually most of the argument by the prosecutor indicating that payton's evidence didn't mitigate the seriousness of his rape and murder is  there were similar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in boyde and which boyde found were not objectionable. but again, the important scrutiny is that the california supreme court evaluated the prosecutor's statements within the correct analytical framework matrix established by boyde. they considered all the correct principles, the  the effect of argument of counsel. they considered the instructions, and like boyde, they found that factor (k) facially directed the consideration 
but it is included if it's  once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk from one station to the other. that walking time, i think it's conceded, would be included.
that's correct.
well, because the congress has enacted a statute 
you want a constitutional rule 20 that in pennsylvania counsel must look into these records.
absolutely, your honor, and 
that  those were the facts of lear. but  it happened that way in lear, but that wasn't the reasoning of lear. lear would not totally cover that situation, but we would submit to this court, it shouldn't make any difference. the reasoning of lear is the same. the licensee cannot, by contract, be estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent.
so  so then you admit that you have to go one by one. i had thought you would  would have said that if the black jurors are questioned in a different way and more intensively, that alone suffices even though the questioning in each case disclosed the basis, plausible, non-racial basis 
only when it's perfectly clear that we didn't know it. [laughter.]
i think 
why?
 tort in 
the odd way to 
and maybe the 
i'm asking if it is your position whether or not he properly can do that?
thank you, mr. kellogg. the case is submitted.
but you have to 
 cases  were those cases of a miscalculation on the part of the state? the judge's view was that the state had miscalculated under eleventh-amendment  under eleventh circuit precedent.
 was asserting 
that's  that's correct, justice o'connor. however 
oh, you mean, oh, you mean more? you have to be more strict for foundation after hurtz testified? i was suggesting the opposite.
there wasn't a need to disclose the point that morgan ii made. it was he who hears must decide.
but you do have a brief here. you have a brief filed in the d.c. circuit, which is brief for industry petitioners on actual emissions definition.
but that is simply another way  when you say it is the choice that's being denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis, that is simply another way of saying you may never use the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the educational objective. you're saying the same thing in a different way.
just for the few of us who think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it possible you could say a word about why congress would, or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate all state water quality standards into a permission to build a dam?
well, that  that 
your honor, two  two things to  two things to point out there. first is that that eliminates only one possible hypothesis and that is the hypothesis that blood was directly spilt onto  onto the  onto the jeans. i think the example that the expert gave was these are not stains, for example, the pouring of a  like coffee  pouring coffee onto the lap of your jeans or something like that. these are simply transfers: one bloody object wiped against another. so while she gave a hypothesis of guilt  and again, your honor, it comes to the could and would distinction. yes, it  that could be considered evidence of guilt, what would a  but, however, that's not the inquiry. the inquiry is what would a reasonable juror who heard that on one side, that it didn't spill directly, but on the other side, heard the evidence that we began  that i began to discuss with justice breyer, which is the evidence of the tbi agent, the photographic evidence, the evidence of the fbi agent, the evidence that the styrofoam box was opened during transit to the fbi and that objects were removed from it during transit.
but is the condition, that there is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the  - in the application of state supreme court? is it 
i think we can 
that, mr. taranto, is something i find very puzzling. there is a statement  one could take it as clear  "capable of substantial noninfringing use." that would be very clear, i agree. but sony goes on for 13 more pages. if the standard were all that clear, it would have stopped there. and usually when you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read on, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant. that doesn't sound very clear to me. or if you then read back, as a careful reader would, then you find this statement that the primary use of the sony machine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the court found either authorized or fair, and, hence, noninfringing. so i don't think you can take from what is a rather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say, "aha, we have a clear rule."
 from the legislative history when the text is clear.
that doesn't seem like such a burden.
that would make them just as happy, i believe.
it must be on there. it is a requirement under the particularity clause that it must be on there for the officer 
is that what you mean? or  or are those just minimums and  and the united states would  would comply with those minimums?
no. it would be under brett. it would be a different standard. but texas law for jury instruction claims clearly states that for preserved error, the standard is chapman.
well, i don't think it's so difficult to 
it  it certainly would be a permissible  permissible argument. what's  what's notable here, justice scalia and mr. chief justice, is how robust this consensus is. we're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in which our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line below which we preserve  presume immaturity. but the line with respect to executions, the trend is very robust and it is very deep.
is it possible  i was worried somewhat about, i think, the problem justice scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable. and then i thought, no, but tell me if this is right. that they're going to fall within 201(b) only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable. now, we could say, and moreover, the fcc has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination. and then, of course, that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation. in other words, it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable 
i do think 
that's correct, chief 
and it wouldn't 
but it says "or."
there's butter on the cake, not in the cake. [laughter.]
it certainly includes it. there's no question about that. does 
well, it  it says located. i mean, do you  what about an atm? does an atm make them  that's all they've got in wyoming. does that make them located in wyoming?
 relishes and 
was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as  to encourage people to study the bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting. nonetheless, religion is important. is there anything like that on the document itself?
did you understand the government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to do that, then the doctor is not liable?
but 
i knew you would. (laughter.)
no, but if you say the arrest was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize the reason why he did.
mr. flores, when i asked you about the sentence on page 10, i intended, not the one that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and that is, "the questioning arising in this case is whether the preclinical research"  that is, the research on animals, as distinguished from humans  "conducted under the scripps-merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of integra's patents." now, if you just took that as the question, then you would say it  this circuit is drawing the line between clinical and preclinical. it's not a crystal-clear opinion, by any means, but that is one question presented that they've identified. and how do they answer that question?
i may misunderstand the hypothetical, justice stevens.
well, mr. chief justice, we think it's often rare that there is no private-person analog, given this court's decision in indian towing, which stresses 
to my knowledge, we have not brought crime  prosecutions under 924(c)(1), based on the circumstances you posit, but that's 
you may. thank you. mr. himmelfarb.
now, if we look to the official other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it isn't safe, there i'd have to say there are probably many more in congress than there are  who say it isn't safe, there are probably many more in congress; and then there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly any in stenberg, not too many.
yes. i  well, i  he didn't talk about not having access to the library. it's implicit, if you look at the joint appendix at 
if i may 
even if they file a cert petition.
but what do you  what do you say to the argument that  that you simply cannot follow that logic ultimately, because when you get to the point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a thousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you can stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a thousand, you're dead. i mean, they're making an argument that this is quantitatively so different that it is qualitatively different.
if he  if he were kept under these restraints, legirons and the  what do they call it  belly chain, day in and day out in prison, would that constitute cruel or unusual punishment?
right, it's "the"  well, it's "the," in the sense of "the activity of purchasing and selling securities," yes. it's  and that's how this court has interpreted, in the o'hagan case, for  if that interpretation  if "the" were read as "his or her," then it's impossible to see how the sec could bring an enforcement action, or the justice department could bring a prosecution, in a case like o'hagan, where the  where the court specifically said that the purchaser or seller was not defrauded. it's not that  it's not true that section 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be defrauded. and so, we submit that this would be 
i'd like you to address that. you said there was a lot of legislation in congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with serious regulation by the fda. and in this case, i don't think congress is opposing the notion. i don't know anybody there who's in favor of global warming. and it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is actually, that would be significantly interfered with by the epa trying to do its best to deal with this problem. or am i wrong?
your honor, first, we  we believe we have  have shown that it's clearly erroneous. second, even viewing the blood evidence separately, even saying, well, mr. house has put up some evidence of  some evidence of innocence regarding this blood evidence, but not enough to really sway me regarding that, that evidence itself has to be viewed in light of the entire record. and in light of the entire record, that blood evidence, standing alone in its even somewhat compromised state, no reasonable juror would be able to come to the conclusion that mr. house was guilty because the remaining evidence of his innocence is also very substantial.
that's  that's the problem.
they wanted to get rid of the state tort suits 
so you don't think it would be enough for the  for the government to prove the discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the act has been violated.
thank you, ms. blatt. mr. porter, we'll hear from you.
now, that was 
thank you, mr. tribe.
may i go back to the cleveland school that justice alito mentioned? an i correct that there were 16 percent whites under the plan? and i'm just wondering what happened to it during the last couple of years?
well, i haven't seen a consensus. a consensus? isn't, doesn't sherer and all these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?
even  even conceding all of that, which i  i think is  let me take a step back. even if you reject that submission, the next provision of the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the handicapped children's protection act, which was enacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(b), and if you look at that provision, it is clear that congress intended the word cost to have a broader meaning. section 4(b)(a) directs the general accounting office to study 
well, the creditors suffer, mr. chief justice. and they suffer because there are additional administrative costs that are incurred that compete with their distributions. we're already talking official about dividing up an inadequate pie to satisfy all claims in full. having a second set of procedures prejudices the creditors. it prejudices the court. bankruptcy judges can have thousands and thousands of cases on their dockets. to have to have a second set of procedures, a second hearing, it burdens the court unnecessarily. and again, it also implicates, again, and i think this is fundamental, the integrity of the process.
yes.
does  does that include a quarrel over offer and acceptance?
what about 
then it isn't the exiting that you're getting at. and i 
i  i wouldn't want to characterize 
that  precisely. just normal principles of litigation counsel that it is appropriate to have a real party in interest. the criminal defendants whose rights are at stake in the statute litigate that case. if you take the step and allow standing for an attorney, based on speculative claims about future clients and economic harm to the attorney, as the dissent in the sixth circuit says, that opens up the possibility of vastly expanding the doctrine of standing beyond what this court has ever said.
your honor, i think it is no different than a basic attorney fee award. there's not, there's not a claim that  that, you know, if someone else, if the uncle pays the attorneys' fees that didn't negate the award of fees on behalf of the child.
justice scalia 
or want to impose a higher tax.
even though the jury has made a finding that the only reason that was done was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.
so that's why he's different from the croupier then, isn't he?
what was the quote from the sg's brief? i didn't 
so maybe that's 
we do defend the judgment of the ninth circuit.
sure. sure. and what i would say with regard to that is that you're right that our broad view is that the ada applies if that  if they're offering public accommodation here in the united states. but if you reject that, i think there are several ways you could approach that. one would be to apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are  that are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient contacts here and whether or not 
basically, justice breyer, but the  the letters 
otherwise, the state immunity, it seems to me, can be  can be fractionated.
yes, if there was a judicial finding that any statement given was 
i guess the straightforward answer that i would give to your question i think is that the constitution does guarantee that the government cannot take your property for public use without just compensation.
your time is expired.
but if you  if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?
 discussion that's figured so prominently in my colleague's argument. it's very, very important to understand that unlike in sprietsma and medtronic and so many of the  and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims in cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. we couldn't have with respect to at least one of those two claims. we filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect to  let me take design defect first. with respect to design defect, it is possible under texas state law to state a claim for products liability under defective design without impeaching the labeling. and there is a brief filed in this case by dean powers, the university of texas law school, for the  the texas chemistry council who's an expert on texas tort law, and he goes through the texas torts in detail to show why they are all preempted and all invalid under independent and adequate state grounds. but what we did is we didn't move to dismiss. we filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this case to this court's decision in celotex v. catrett, and we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think that what you are complaining about does impeach the labeling. therefore, show us what you have. now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives. they could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule 56(f), as this court referenced in anderson v. liberty lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. we don't know how this was tested. we don't know how this was manufactured. we're entitled to discovery, and district courts recognize that all the time. what they did 
 in essence, he did, when we 
well, that's because the court conceived of there  there being one entity, so you couldn't  you couldn't change  split that one entity into two fictitious persons.
as far as  as far as the  the ripeness issue, it's not  because of the way florida chose to do their procedure, it was not ripe, and it doesn't comport with this court's basic ripeness doctrine that we are going to presume it's going to be done a certain way when the state can come in and say, it's not ripe for review, we  we still have the ability to change this rather than us coming 
in state court in the 
yeah, but there is a first amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution, people other than the state, who is bringing this prosecution.
the punishment for the invalidity should not be the  the inadmissibility of all of the evidence of the crime that was found.
well, two answers to that, justice breyer. first of all, that seems to be a  a place for state doctrines of tolling to apply, not federal law. second of all, this court in  in heck against humphrey, which we cited in our brief, solves this 
but here's the problem with going public. it's perverse to create an incentive for employees to go public, especially employees in sensitive position  in a sensitive position. the first amendment consequences here are especially grave, because ceballos had no realistic alternative channel for communication open to him. had he gone to a blog, web site, podcast, and so on, as petitioners say in their reply brief, or held a press conference, or gone to los angeles times, and so on, he'd be fired, and he'd lose any first amendment case that he brought. so, what avenue does a prosecutor who wants 
well, and edmond also said it's not a search.
but it was not so long ago that the department of justice took a different view. and of all of the vertical restraints, this is the only one where congress has been a player. i mean, congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. and then it withdrew that. there's no other restraint where they are has been congressional action, where the argument could be made, well, congress is well aware of this, the court should allow them to make the change, if they so will.
i wouldn't put it as strongly as that, justice scalia. what i would say is that the further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals should look more critically at the reasons that the district court gave and ensure that the constellation of reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to be a disproportionate sentence than 
isn't that the problem? on the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up without even the procedural rights, because you're saying the only person who can basically invoke a violation of procedural right is the person whose been denied the substantive right. the parent hasn't been denied the substantive right. therefore, the parent cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly on your own analysis, the parent has been given. that can't be correct.
your honor 
mr. clement, if we reverse as you suggest and the state supreme court said, well, i guess we were wrong under the first amendment, we just realized our state constitution requires the same result, would that judgment stand, do you think?
okay.
i  i like justice ginsburg's answer better. (laughter.)
they aren't unambiguous. they contradict each other. the agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice. even if i assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake. one or the other had to be the mistake. we decided it was this one. why shouldn't we take their word on it?
five, five weeks?
well, whether or not the state has that obligation  it may very well have that obligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that to one side, it does seem as if the critical question is whether or not the state, in fact, has adopted a method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and where a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling to identify a permissible alternative to bring that claim besides 
it's pretty flabby.
 a malicious prosecution claim. you'd have a malicious prosecution claim.
well, but don't 
 the legal incidence of the tax, i would think their side would win, in my mind. now suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.
no, but isn't  isn't the problem with your analogy that counsel do not advise their clients about brady rights because, by definition or in the normal case by definition, counsel doesn't know whether there's a brady violation. but counsel does know or, it seems to me, can properly be charged with knowing that when he's representing a foreign national, the foreign national has a vienna convention right, just as much as the foreign national has a miranda right, and he can advise him of that. so it seems to me the brady analogy is  is not apt.
 constitutionally compelled to do so?
it  if it's running as a party, it should run somebody who  who shares the views of the people in that party, which is somebody who is nominated by  by the people in that party, or at least those people, joined by others who are not affiliated with another party. that seems to me to make a lot of sense. and it seems to me to destroy that system if  if you say, hey, we're  you know, we  we're going to allow the libertarian party to say, you know, we don't have any real views. we're just going to  we want to nominate somebody that most people like. so let the republicans come in, the democrats come in. the only thing we want is to win. we don't really care.
 as opposed 
that  that's true, but again, if it was just a matter of who has access to the relevant evidence, then that would  the burden should have been on the defendant, that it wasn't just a matter of that. there was this other principle which is that the  there was already a showing  there's already a showing that the government has taken wrongful action to induce the crime. and that's why the burden shifts to the defendant  to the government to show that this particular person wasn't predisposed.
in the federal circuit's 
do you agree with the government, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is violated when a school which uniformly applies to all employers the rule, "you can't come in if you have the discrimination against hiring gay people"?
i presume it could lead to lower consumer prices too. if you have a firm that has developed a new, a new technique for processing the logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and thereby make even more profit, that firm would be willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would sell them for less than competitors might sell them.
i don't believe there's anything that specifically says that, your honor. no. but there are cases out there that say that under the exigent circumstances, it's got to be a serious situation, and the question then becomes is  is the situation  is the party  is the loud noise complaint serious enough to warrant entering into the home. and no, we would say it's not, your honor. it doesn't rise to that level, especially considering the fact that the exigency that the officers relied upon, the smack  and it was over. the situation was already under control.
and we suggest that that is the appropriate test here.
these disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff? i find that hard to believe. i mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures.
thank you, mr. schalit. mr. bedrick, you have 4 minutes left.
that's correct, your honor.
does the gravamen of the argument  is it that this phrase is unambiguous?
 determination.
"schwartz," "schwartz" candy bars.
and i'm just wondering. in michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation because there's no point in litigating it i suppose?
mr. waxman, you were dealing with fields, and the answer in fields' case that the prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about rehabilitation, and so he was  he thought that everyone could be rehabilitated  rehabilitated. so that shows he  he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts about rehabilitation.
all right, and was there any  any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a different facility?
but you can't 
is it  is it  maybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there is a relationship between the merits and the interlocutory review decision. i would suppose if we agreed on the merits with the government  in other words, adopted a fairly clear and categorical rule  the need for an interlocutory appeal would diminish because the district courts would almost always get it right. but if we adopt a standard for the application of this bar that, you know, depends on a lot of different things, then the appellate court is going to disagree with the district court in a greater number of circumstances, and maybe we should allow an interlocutory review of that.
i'm asking if there are any individuals now before this court in this case 
well, justice scalia, i'm starting from the proposition that the language of the wire fraud statute textually applies to this scheme, and petitioner's argument is that, because of the common law revenue rule, the statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue. and the fact that a foreign government is defrauded of tax revenue does not mean that the united states does not have an independent interest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it. in addition to the collateral criminal conduct that such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes indicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can turn its techniques for used  using to smuggle into canada, also to smuggle back into the united states or to victimize other victims in the united states.
who's geico? i mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means. if you get one lawyer who says, you know, i think you could read it this way, does that mean that geico reads it that way?
and 
absolutely not.
so in brooke group, we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, and in this other case we said it's a benefit when prices are high to suppliers.
vessel in navigation.
well, so is the road, for pete's sake.
 but i don't think that that goes very far with respect to answering this question. for one thing, as this court pointed out in the gonzales decision, the requirement that there be a federal crime, and, therefore, a federal felony under 924(c)(2), comes from the language in 924(c)(1) that says that the crime must be subject to prosecution in a court of the united states. and this court, in gonzales, said it's that language that renders the  renders it a requirement that official it be a federal crime. the definition of 
i'm not, your honor. first of all, i don't know and would contend that the initial sentencing commission did not take into account all of the four purposes of sentencing. they centered on crime control 
in this area of constitutional violation.
yes, your honor, and exactly the same could be said about artuz, the procedural bar rules in artuz, whether someone pled 
 the lds.
yes. and so i go to michigan, and now i pay all the registration fees here. do i get a  a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to show i did it?
yes. and you can, you can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the nebraska case, dr. fitzhugh, says, that, well, i don't do the intact removal because if i wanted to do that i would have to do a second round of dilation with a second round of laminarias. and of course, that second round of laminaria is also a medical procedure. like the injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks of infection. if you looked at dr. creinen's testimony, this is at 174 a to 177 a in the eighth circuit petition appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the patient. and that's his testimony. so there are countervailing indications here. and as i say, this idea of trying to prohibit a practice that involves further dilation is not an irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one of the things that congress heard was that there were risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence. and that's a particularly important concern because first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very good position to evaluate that risk because they provide abortion services, not follow-up services. so they're not in a good position to judge that risk. second of all, the only study we have here points out that there is a greater incidence of that preterm delivery in the group that had a d&x procedure. now again they say, they are going to come up and say well it's not statistically significant. but the numbers i think are striking. they had 17 women in the group that had a d&x and came back. two of them had a preterm pregnancy. the d&e group was much larger, 45, and two of them had a preterm delivery. now i think as a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to be in a room with 17 people where two people were going to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with 45 and two  bad things were going to happen to two, i know which room i'd like to be in. and all i'm pointing out 
but in terms of discrimination and economic impact, they really are the same?
well, i thought you indicated that you advise the states that they do have to advise him of this right during the booking process or the interrogation.
we don't believe that that's the case. that is, at this point, the rule has been amended so that the time for filing a post-verdict motion is 10 days after entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after verdict, as it used to be. but this court said, in johnson, that, in the absence of a renewed verdict post  a renewed motion post-verdict, neither the district court nor the court of appeals may order entry of judgment in the favor of the verdict loser. and i think that the text of rule 50(b) bears that out. if you look farther down that paragraph, on page 58(a), the rule says, "submission of the case to the jury is to be treated  or considered to be a reservation of the legal question." and then it said, "the movant may renew the request." and then that sentence says, "in ruling on a renewed motion, the court may, if a verdict was returned, allow the judgment to stand or grant a new trial or order entry of judgment." and i think that phrase, "in ruling on a new  renewed motion," is significant, because the only express authority that the district court has, post-verdict, to grant judgment as a matter of law is that the court may do so in ruling on a renewed motion. the rule doesn't contemplate a situation 
but the question is, you say the pto has recognized that it issued this patent, that it's an invalid issuance. so why aren't they curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is going to do?
if they do  if there is no proper defendant, then i think 
the reg doesn't 
yes. there is  there are  for example, in scheduling of drugs  and the u.s. attorney general suggests, for example, that he could simply schedule these drugs in a way to  as a way of avoiding the oregon act  or voiding the oregon act, as it were. and, to do that, he has to get his medical and scientific advice from the secretary of health and services, and must accept that advice and be bound by it. and certainly, that wasn't done in this case. so, i hope that answers your question.
i  i think in their reply brief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go and  and do a 50-state survey between a week ago and now to find out. but, you know, a fair number of states do. i  i would say 15, 20.
is that the way we do it?
so just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?
i mean, if he can  if he's not a gang leader, he can tell them why he isn't.
take the chief justice's hypothetical, add the following. there is a provision in there to the effect that if, during the term of this contract, the license is determined to be invalid, royalties will still be payable under this contract 
it was actually denied by judge hall. so the only thing that's  that's occurred is the hearing strictly on whether or not there was  was consent.
i'm not sure i view that the  the question as not having been decided below. and the court also did grant certiorari on waiting time.
well, i guess another way of saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before the report is submitted? i  i guess that's my question.
do you think that there's something of an anomaly there, that you have a system that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it, works for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't have to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked rather well, so we'll keep it. what's constitutionally required one day gets constitutionally prohibited the next day. that's very odd.
in our view, it would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent employee would be deprived of the benefits of the westfall act, and if i could use a more simple 
with direct shipping 
 the  it isn't all about other people. the  the  that crime included  and it's accepted in this case that the postal service board of  board member accepted 30 percent of the fees paid by respondent's company to the consulting firm. respondent's company. he was the chief executive officer.
strictly speaking, it's not, your honor, because of course, this is a patent case.
 point is 
in this particular case, the respondents made a conscious litigation choice in the district court to waive a rule of reason claim. and this case proceeded in the court of appeals with the rule of reason challenge to the creation of the joint venture as waived. the court below didn't question that at all. it accepted it. it accepted that there had been a waiver of a rule of reason challenge, that this efficiency-enhancing joint venture had substantial economic justifications, and what it  and the only  the only rule of reason challenge that could have been brought then was waived by these parties. another case. that's not this case. another case, a rule of reason inquiry could be brought.
we both know there's no 
how about a case 
 of the way congress chose to write 1101(a)(43).
well, justice breyer, i'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and 
all right.
thank you, mr. andre. mr. salmons.
you said  you said we don't know, but you  that's slightly in conflict with what you said earlier. they asked 26 questions. how long was this telephone conversation between the 911 operator and the victim?
if you take the meaning of contract that he takes in section 2.
your 
and if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race. that is discrimination based on race.
it's used that standard order for the last 20 years or longer. the only michigan court of appeals case in  only published case in an application for leave setting is the bobenal case cited by the people in our  the state of michigan in its brief, in which the michigan court of appeals said there is no  this is not a determination on the merits. the only published case for michigan in which there was an application for leave from a plea-based conviction is people v. berry in which the michigan court of appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a collateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and said that its original 
it seems like the consequence of your theory though 
sure.
he couldn't have recalled the opinion because of the extraordinary circumstance. my god, i made a mistake. he couldn't recall the opinion, could he?
again, we 
and they're mad at him for not giving back that easement which they failed to record.
absolutely, and that is exactly what weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by their own materials, that their plan was and in fact they did foresee and project that log prices would go down in 2001 
i think its statute says that it  it decides the particular case and does not set forth propositions of law that are binding in future cases. if it's not bound by its prior cases, i don't know why we should be.
well, and it also isn't in fact. and the question here is 
why do we  how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice? that's the issue in the case.
pardon me?
no, no, no. you're entitled to get the evidence in, under oregon law, but the question of how that evidence can properly be used by the jury has been decided by the oregon supreme court only on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on the basis of any oregon statute.
no, but the point 
justice ginsburg, it's just not true. the lower courts well understand this distinction, and they  they let go all the time claims as not preempted that are true manufacturing defect or true design defect claims. this is not a complete immunity. this is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling. there is a famous example of the benlate 
and the statute by its terms only 
true, true.
and the suit is tossed out because one of those deadlines was met. it would follow, i think, under your reasoning that there could be no subsequent bivens claim.
your honor, i think the important lesson from crawford in that regard is  is the methodology, and the methodology was let's look at history. what does history tell us the founders were concerned about? and the court listed the specific examples of affidavits, depositions, pretrial hearings, and  and expanded that even to include interrogation. and in  excuse me  particular cases coming  coming up, if there is evidence that  that the statements do correspond to historical abuses, even if those abuses were not listed in crawford, then that would be a different situation. that would be testimonial.
does epa, or anyone else, have authority to say, "that isn't a proper clean water act standard, however good you may think it is"?
your  your position is strengthened by the other three provisions of the statute that mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, i take it. you think it's unambiguous just as it read  as it's read on its own.
of course, i could say the same thing about going to jail, i mean, at all.
right. i picked one.
well, willett versus devoy, it involved a clerk demanding more money than the law allowed, and the court said: "no distinction is made on the ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it over to the government. such a judge-made restriction on the general statute requiring that the money be kept by the individual might itself bring about uncertainty, confuse and possibly great injustice."
you don't defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality, do you?
 based on the conduct to others. why wouldn't a normal juror think 
no, but the only thing we know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an attempt at burglary. if the burglary were a generic burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the official end of the case.
 could you tell us really 
well, the reason i would suggest that  and answering that is not necessarily appropriate or helpful in resolving the question  is because of the series of cases that we quoted in footnote 15 of our brief. in certain instances, the california courts have found 3 and a half years, 1 and a half years, 2 years to be reasonable. now, that doesn't mean 
i mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide  well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline? is that how it works? i'm not a scientist, but i'd be surprised if it was so rigid.
justice kennedy, reciprocity laws  yet  possibly. they may be a necessary requirement now that so many states are closed to states. they may be a necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines to market in the way that the framers envisaged. it may be a necessary, for now, to get into closed states. in a world that we hope that you create, in which discrimination is not allowed, they would be completely unnecessary and possibly unconstitutional. but to return to the key point here, michigan and new york may not facially discriminate in favor of their own producers unless they can show that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. and here, justice souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny, they have not come close to making that kind of showing, because there are all these other means  means that have been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate, means that have been proven in states from new hampshire to virginia, means that are not based on facial discrimination. it's the discrimination that has to be shown to 
yes, but aren't the vast majority of guilty pleas unambiguous? this is a rather rare case.
in this case it took no position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it said that there would be serious problems if antitrust law were applied to these allegations. it would interfere with the agency's ability to define what is manipulation and to amend its definitions. it has ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to this issue; and it said further that it would discourage underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition, which is very important in this area. because if they don't step over the line and they engage in book building conversations, that's critical to setting the right price for the ipo. and so 
he just said  your brother said, well  because i simplified that to the ring, and he says, well, if in fact you had a subrogation right or some other absolutely clear contractual right to get repaid from the ring, you know, which is a physical thing, you couldn't  stronger than your case  you couldn't get it in equity. if i really knew about the 18th century cases, i would realize that, and it's only my ignorance that and my dissent that prevents me from understanding this.
well 
ms. smith.
we are not complaining about segregation resulting from purposeful discrimination. that's 
i think it is, justice stevens, and i think the court would address that by saying certainly on the negligent misrepresentation claim at this stage the record indicates that there was a ruling in china, but the appellate window is still open. and certainly the evidence has long gone into the chinese case. those are completely separate issues.
well, it did have corroboration. wasn't there a  a wound on the victim that was consistent with  with the confession?
but there was no individual in that case. that was a case of one nation against another. there was no individual, like the plaintiff here.
we're reading from the footnote number 3 of the amicus curiae's brief at  at page 4.
no. no, i don't believe  with  with respect, what  what i believe the court said was that there is a reasonable time limitation. and given the  given the distinction that runs throughout immigration laws, this court said at page 2500 of the supreme court reports in this decision, the distinction between aliens who arrive at our borders and are governed by mezei, as opposed to people who enter, runs throughout our immigration law, i would think that it would run throughout 1231(a)(6).
it's hard to accept that argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the reverse order, there would be the same morale. all the rest would follow. so here it's  it's a question of the lawyer brought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the morale  there's no difference if a bivens action had been brought and no other action. is there any  why is this morale changed by the government having gotten the first case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at all?
but i thought that 
no, your honor. that's incorrect.
your honor, i believe it was about 20 years ago.
okay.
i mean, logically you're right. i accept all that you're saying logically. you could make those distinctions, but you also could come out the other way logically. and so to expose to you what's really bothering me about the case are two things. one, i think you're worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side. but this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what's bothering me is that  that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction i just made. and if we decide for you, we're going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 states and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it. now, that's what's worrying me because i wouldn't want to reach a decision, in the absence of it being clear anyway, that would make a significant negative difference to the gross national product of the united states, for example.
justice 
to the  to the purchase price.
not even 
and when you say there is no precedent  i mean, i think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor  i.e., the physical liquid  which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect  now, your  that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in young's market. i read the briefs in that case. the briefs presented that court  you could have written those briefs. and the difficulty for you is, it articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by section 2 of the twenty-first amendment. and this court squarely rejected it.
mr. smith, may  may i ask you to comment on  on one problem that i have with your position that has nothing whatever to do with the  with the fact that there was a  a judicial redrawing in the first place here? if i understand your argument, you're saying that a  a districting that takes place prior to the report of a new decennial census, which is done for purely political reasons, maximizing political advantage, is invalid for that reason, i guess under the equal protection clause.
no. we're talking about the trial court.
well, edwards is directed at avoiding badgering, but the issue before us is initiation. that's not a question of badgering, it's a question of initiation. and don't the points that justice ginsburg raised go to whether the initiation is likely to have been a voluntary initiation?
our  our view is that it's the main office. i would defer somewhat to my colleague from the government who can speak for the comptroller on this question, but our view would be that it's the main office. and  and i think it's important to understand that when we're interpreting these statutes, at every time when one of these  when the statute was reenacted, there would have been total parity between our definition of located. there would have been one place for a national bank. there would have been one citizenship for a state bank.
in fact, that is precisely the analysis 
 but 2253 is a jurisdictional bar to this court.
 an army 
well, the government has 
this will not have any adverse, if i understand the facts, any adverse impact whatsoever on any unsecured creditor.
can i ask you a preliminary question before you get too far into your argument? is it your understanding that the instructions to the jury were that finding that predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to establish a section 2 violation? i know the court of appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think the jury was so instructed?
because if it was 
but, mr. kneedler, recognizing that distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the statute that's before us?
i guess we should ask the other side, but i think i know what their answer will be, whether if the court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction? and what do you think?
and that's the end of it.
 for the constitutional reason.
the title of the webb-kenyon act is, "it is in  an act divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases. the clear intent of the webb-kenyon act was to remove alcohol from the commerce clause. the constitution  the twenty-first amendment constitutionalized that commerce clause framework." that's what this court said in craig v. boren. craig v. boren also said, "the twenty-first amendment creates an exception to the operation of  the normal operation of the dormant commerce clause."
it's a very vague indication. i mean, i  i agree with you that your argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it  it perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to stretch to the  to the limit of federal jurisdiction, you need a clear statement. i certainly wouldn't consider 404(g)  if  if the act did not previously include the kind of authority you're arguing for, i would not  i would not consider 404(g) a clear statement of that  of that new  new authority.
and how much of its advertising budget is pitched at u.s. customers?
well, they do and they don't.
yes, the general rule which the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here. for example, in the shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't say anything. he doesn't yell or scream or even raise his hand. he just holds a little sign in the shakespeare class that says "bong hits 4 jesus." as i understood the general rule that you said the teacher was bound to know here, the teacher i suppose would be required or the school would be required to tolerate that sign in the shakespeare class; is that correct?
why did you say there were 7 percent of these that  that are probably okay?
no.
yes.
 to mean by the words they use?
what is  what is the answer to justice kennedy's question? i took it, whether  for the last 21 years, industry throughout america has taken the standard as being approximately whether it is capable of substantial  commercially significant substantial noninfringing uses.
well, you know, perhaps that's one way to determine what the court meant. but i would suggest 
 in that 
as long as arizona applied that principle of liability to private persons in arizona.
no, justice  the trial judge ruled that we could offer the evidence, because we were not before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact. and he stated so, that he would separate out, for himself, what he could consider and what he could not. and his verdict in this case, on the "guilty, except insane," focused only on whether eric knew right from wrong.
you see now in  in the employment cases where  where somebody is dismissed for a  a racially discriminatory reason and  and you have to prove that the same action would have been taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with the discriminatory motive whether that person would have taken that action anyway. whereas here, the person who brought the prosecution is not in this case. it's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor. i don't know how that person could  could possibly establish that the prosecution would have been brought anyway. it wasn't up to him.
no, i'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct. violation of an fcc regulation is unjust. failing to comply with an fcc regulation is unjust.
that's one by one. every time there is another trespass he has to go all the way through the administrative procedure and then when the, when the administrative court says, well, it was okay, then he has to go through the regular federal courts. that doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for somebody who claims he's being systematically harassed for five years as, as is the claim here.
i believe that was pre-ada, your honor. but i think that the point  the point is that the record of constitutional violations here is a nationwide record. it's a record that includes some incidents from georgia. it's a record that includes many incidents from many other states; as i say, 37 different states. it's a record of constitutional violations that's been judicially confirmed. we have courts actually finding 
that's correct.
so, that's  it's something different. it's a  it's a whole other animal, because "real party in interest," as used in the federal rules, is a device  is a joinder device, is in the joinder rules. now you're saying, "ah, but there's some other real-party concept out there that has to do with jurisdiction."
because when you're talking about hate speech, speech that advocates violence, then you're in another category of speech. there has been general recognition 
the california 
 can you give me a reason for the government's adopting (e), the 10-year  the 10-year bar, other than for stale claims or 
well, in all due respect, only one has the sentence 
so there were two statutes bearing on the same remedy.
you're right.
justice ginsburg, very important question. we are here today because a majority of states have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. and a handful of them, including michigan and new york, have chosen to do so in a discriminatory manner. so long as states do not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard to other alcohol  and they don't; there's a flat prohibition across the united states, in terms of beer and other types of spirits  we will not be here, because there would be no discrimination; there would be a single rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.
and people who actually know this industry. and they, there are two things that come from the record in this case. the first is all of the experts and engelgau himself testified not simply, no, this is not obvious, but you would have never used asano to solve this or any other problem with an electronic throttle control.
thank you, mr. blume. mr. zelenka.
i do not know that.
that is correct, your honor.
sounds to me like a complaint, a response 
yes, but supposing there are disagreements. we were  you were talking about cigarettes. but supposing there's a legitimate disagreement between the industry position and the government position 
i mean, it seems to me  and i don't want to make a joke, but i think you're on to something when you talk about the exiting, because the word "discharge," as we commonly use it, is a word that describes how you get rid of something. and how you get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly the same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the bank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through the turbine after impounding it, it is the  everybody's been quoting dictionary definitions  it's the "flowing out." the flowing out is the same with the barrel as it is with the dam.
there was one question brought up about ohio's own practice. but you  you say we have no obligation to relieve burdens. if we did, we would violate the establishment clause. the point was made that ohio pays for chaplains, but it doesn't pay for, say, psychologists to come in for agnostics. so aren't you right there violating the establishment clause on your own theory?
what we asked for was an equivalence.
of course. it's not meant to be.
but you're not 
that's true, and  and i would suggest that if that occurred and you applied equitable principles, the insurer could argue, i think rightfully so, that the insurer impaired its subrogation rights. that would be an equitable claim. the point i'm making, your honor, is that none of this occurred here because the procedural posture of this case was a motion for summary judgment at the district court level where mamsi went in and said all that matters are the contract terms. we don't have to look at whether the sereboffs were made whole. we don't have to look at whether there was double recovery. we can't consider our diligence in refusing 
the state doesn't tell you how to do it.
oh, i would hope it's stronger. i would hope it's higher than probable cause.
the court: thank you, mr. mellen. mr. gordon, you have 2 minutes remaining.
well, yes, but why?
suppose a policeman follows me around. he just  just follows me around, observing with his  with plain eyes, nothing else. now, is that a search? does he need probable cause to do that? now, he's wasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe he should get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to follow me.
no. but with respect, i  isn't the  the term that they use  and i was going to ask essentially the same question. the term that the court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his innocence. and i will  i will grant you this. when i read that, it said  i thought to myself it sounds as though they are saying he must present evidence or make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more probable than not that he is innocent despite the state's evidence. but they never spell that out, and is it spelled out anywhere?
 he lives elsewhere.
well, i didn't understand that the  the prisoners in this particular part of the prison had any intermediate incentive. they either get out after a year or 2 or they don't. isn't that right? i mean, they either get to a different classification.
the 
that vessel's function is gambling. he sure is.
but not the consent 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
so she was docked in her pay for 2 weeks. i mean, for some people, this would be a real hardship, no pay for 2 weeks. i mean, it's  it's final as far as she's concerned, for those 2 weeks.
if it's not, then we're not  i'm sorry.
your honor, i accept that as a proposition of the compelled-speech doctrine, absolutely. and what i'm trying to point out is that in this case what congress has done is to engage in the most viewpoint-oriented regulation of speech. the reason congress does not  the reason congress is insisting that the law schools disseminate the recruiting messages is because of the message of the law 
so the legal issues would be precisely the same if the state denied totally any reading material to the prisoners. we'd have the same issue.
 one must assume in this area they haven't.
well, what's your answer as to whether there is any limitation on the judge just suggesting, "by the way, you know, is there some reason why you haven't pleaded statute of limitations?" can a  can a judge do that?
but the whole basis for the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.
that's exactly what it is. and as i say, as a matter of policy, justice breyer, i wouldn't necessarily disagree with it. but as a matter of what the constitution strait-jackets states to provide, it strikes me as a  as a pretty extraordinary rule.
 suggesting that the ada does not add to the burdens of the state officials, it just simply tracks what's already required under turner?
well, let  well, please finish.
but unless he were told that, the  the waiver that  that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right.
and how likely is it, if you have a jury who thinks the  a juror, who thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going to conclude that the state has carried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here don't outweigh the 50 here?
it's clear he is saying that i would have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.
so wouldn't it odd for this court to decide that issue of california law?
is  is that so with  with respect to someone else's use of  of your property? it seems to me very rare where  where someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't  wouldn't give you the property back and  and simply say, you know  i can think of a few extraordinary examples. if somebody makes a statue out of stolen gold, you know, the  the old classic, i guess you'd get the money back. but ordinarily we're talking about a property right here, and  and the property right is  is explicitly the right to exclude others from  from use of that. that's what the patent right is. and all he's asking for is give me my property back.
well, forget this statute for a second because i'll stop you there. i want you to tell me why those sums  i get the time. i get the amount.
absolutely, your honor. and that matter would  would be back to a  a situation in which there's examinations or hearings or argument or post-hearing brief, and  and the judge can take as long as the judge wants there. but once the court has the matter under advisement, the court only has 30 days.
but now, you just were going to say here's what was happening. do you mean under the new policy?
martinez was released pursuant to the court  district court order almost 2 years ago, and he's  he's now at large under an order of supervision.
if the court felt  the 7-day period is not to allow the court to rehear the case. if the court wishes to invoke 
when  when 
i thought it was a deer.
and do you have any idea how many there are of those?
excuse me.
the except 
the  i think i do. in our view 
that believe is how 
no, sir.
it hasn't resulted in a  in a disaster. that's the point that justice breyer is making.
more like 100, more like 50, more like 10, more like 5? about how many?
i would agree that if there is 
suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.
yes, justice stevens, but they're not tailored to this particular problem or abuse. they are remedies, for example, the denial of the discharge for concealing assets under section 727. official but that won't 
do you think we should give any credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?
but then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to  official
well, you can enforce the  the discrimination provisions, but the structural provisions don't have to be enforced. once the step is changed, they're not going to change it when they get 3 miles out.
well, in that case, if the witness knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking them to violate, they have a duty, under those circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your offense. that's a duty that's imposed by criminal law. so if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would fall within the interpretation of the statute that arthur andersen is advancing here. and it fits, your honor, with what congress really did for a hundred years before 2002. what it did is, it said that  under the pettibone rule, that it is not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of a proceeding. but if you know that  if you know that a crime has been  a crime has been committed and you destroy documents, that is a crime.
and presumably up to this court, if they want to come that far.
 theory there.
well, that's just because it's loud? suppose they were just singing and laughing?
can you give me some specific examples of what michigan would require that the occ does not require? you mentioned licensing, for example.
that's true, but is it also not true that some of the people who get retaliated against may be the same people who bring the qui tam action?
so  so, in other words, if it  when the guy is 2 years  15 years old, he gives a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore. you have to go to the probate court.
the  the only thing he would be entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesser instruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct, there's no error.
back to your example about the political party saying you can't use it for democrats, what if they said, as they might have in the 1940s, you can use it for anybody except communist candidates?
correct.
i mean 
the circumstances of the new case are entirely different. in fact, in that  in the present  the new case, the court decided that he was not eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory limitations that exist section 109(e). there is a three-year time span between the two, and we believe that the existing case is not moot because he still has remedies that he can obtain in chapter 13.
now, why is that? now  to some extent this is a call for the district judge. there is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so. and both of them would be acting lawfully; isn't that  isn't that conceivable?
which has liberally granted amendments.
well, why 
your 
yes 
you may respond briefly.
i don't think that there's any evidence in the record to support that, justice scalia. that  that  what happened is that he took  that he listened to her oral statement and then he proceeded to ask for  her for an affidavit, after he had the information that he needed to resolve the emergency, was to figure out how he was going to protect this person from an immediate renewed attack if he left the scene.
i take it you're reserving it for  in your  in your brief.
well, if you go back to the rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and then, you know, you would say something. or if the court, you know, gave you a year or something by mistake, you know, it would  you know, that something does not sound right here. and then you would look at it. at least if that were the case, you could probably go in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the attention of the court. your honor, we did not have all of this time. did you make a mistake? you can always correct mistakes. but that was not done here, it was not done by the respondent in this case because they didn't  the respondent did not object to the application to reopen the appeal, did not say anything 
well, when there's probable cause to enter, there's no presumption of innocence, is there, or am i wrong?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
okay.
counsel, what  what do you do with our opinion in  in 1986 in segura v. united states, which seems to me to contradict your assertion that you cannot separate, for purposes of the exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search? in that case, the  the policemen entered without a search warrant. so the entry was clearly a violation. they left two officers in the room and other officers went back and got a search warrant. when they returned with the search warrant, the two officers who were in the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the evidence. it seems to me that in that case, we  we did succeed in  in separating the  the entry from the subsequent search, and i don't know why  why we can't do the same thing here.
but  but the certified letter saying that i'm going to stipulate with  i'm going to enter into settlement negotiations with xyz corporation, would not really have served any purpose unless they were to be included in every step of the way, because these settlement negotiations sometimes extend over months and years and  and some of them seem like they go forever. and to have the  the state at the injured plaintiff's side throughout all of that step would be a logistical problem. and  and in any event, it  the plaintiff is in control of the litigation. the state has no right to say, you go to trial or you don't go to trial. we don't agree that you're getting enough. if  if you go  if you settle at this figure, we're going to be cut short.
so you're back to the presumption. but 
that's correct as well. and i would go further that the practical problem is what happened in our case where it wasn't raised in the trial  in  in the case until after a trial on the merits and after the jury returned the verdict, and we wasted a lot of time. it  it could have been brought up beforehand as a  a substantive motion for summary judgment or a 12(b)(6) motion if the pleadings resolved the issue.
and that's where you hang. you  you really think congress, when it enacted title ix, paid close attention and said  instead of saying no person in the united states shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had  had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. we have to take out that person's. i  i don't  it doesn't strike me as a  as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. it's a very natural way to write it: no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex.
with respect to a standard sufficiency analysis, no, justice alito. it's just a question for the appellate judge to discern, was there sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.
so  so that's a problem. is there any other problem?
why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?
but the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again. they will not feel that they can take it into account in any way to determine that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy, or that, i guess it was, i get the cole and the brewer records confused here, but that this, the cause for the violence will abate with, with age.
am  am i correct that the  the particular provision that you think is relevant here is  is (h)(1)(a) on page 4 of the  the appendix in the blue brief?
yes, your honor, that's correct.
i hope not, justice scalia. i hope not. i think 
so if the treaty 
your honor, we object to the  if that's the sole goal of a school district absent past discrimination, we object. but that kind of hypothetical situation isn't even necessary for the court to reach.
well, let's take that last one first, if you don't mind, since the argument is that you've waived that argument by not  not raising it below.
and  first of all, the court doesn't have to decide that in this case because we have a regime where each of the aliens before this court, came here, was paroled 
i'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the fourteenth amendment again, and i know this court didn't try in mlb, and i know this court didn't try in smith v. robbins, so that there is  there is a component of both. and it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that i think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the griffin/douglas line.
isn't there  the current rule, isn't there some leeway for cases where the prisoner simply doesn't know the names?
and  and one of the serious problems in the solution that booker chose is that while judicial discretion, which i think 3553(a) requires and mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too, doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on the scale, and which the district court, in the day to day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the district courts, has a far greater appreciation for, than a court of appeals would.
by not occupying it, you mean including not licensing it to somebody else.
but part of this award, at least according to the trial  there's a footnote referring to an oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the state of oregon. is  was this award shared?
thank you, ms. vullo. mr. stewart?
 to accept.
 "don't buy a crib without a crib-death device" 
do  do we have a transcript of that hearing here?
if you gave no context of what kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what kind of scope it had, so that a court could balance 
you have this only in a footnote in your reply brief. it wasn't raised in the bio.
you're giving 
you can always raise it.
but would it  would it have been a complete defense? suppose the prosecutor, who is immune, gets on the witness stand and says, well, i know all about this  the first amendment stuff, but i was going to bring this prosecution anyway because it seemed to me there was a serious crime here. that's all he says. wouldn't that be the end of the case?
i'm not suggesting it serves him right. i'm suggesting that whether juries impose death often depends in part as well on the moral blameworthiness or how they perceived the victim. this was not like witness, an innocent witness. this was somebody who was involved in that. and that normally makes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a death sentence.
yes, but if you're looking  if you're taking your standard seriously 
in heck and in younger. there's the concurrence in deacons against monahan indicates that a claim for damages should be stayed and not dismissed or gone forward with. justice white's concurrence specifically addressed the difference between dismissing and going forward with the claim. of course, the footnotes 8 and 9 in the heck opinion are very powerful indications of the weighty reasons. we have no reason to think that the district court would want to charge ahead with a claim that would  with a case that will only get simpler if it waits for the state court proceedings to conclude, as well as of course the comity and respect for the state courts. in this case, of course, as i mentioned, the  mr. wallace always had a claim available to him for his initial seizure regardless of the outcome of his criminal prosecution. if he wanted to seek damages for that prosecution and our primary submission, part one of our brief is even assuming those damage might be available on a fourth amendment claim, he was nevertheless obligated to bring that claim within the period of the statute of limitations, because otherwise it would be time barred. in our view, petitioner does not have one claim for that arrest and another claim for his trial and prosecution. he has one claim for a fourth amendment violation with two elements of damages. but mounting future or delayed damages do not delay accrual. even where the plaintiff does not know the full extent of his injuries, he still must sue within the period of the statute of limitations. in fact, petitioner does not cite a single case including the ones newly arrived in the reply brief that uses either his accrual rule or his damages rule to award damages for the entire time of a lengthy period of incarceration. and as i indicated petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show favorable termination. and although he could have obtained some damages had he brought his claim timely, his claim did accrue he was seized and not when the charges 
i agree with that. but that doesn't mean it's irrelevant for the due process totality of circumstances analysis. and then he proceeds from there directly in to the patton analogy, and i think if you read that analogy in context, he is telling them you're soldiers in a war, you have a duty to kill, i'm like patton, i'm telling you it's your duty to kill, go kill. if you read that logically 
because the  the rule says a special report shall be presumed to be correct.
yes, justice breyer.
 district court 
 i want to hear you and know if there's an additional one. i'm not disputing that one. i just want to be sure i get them all. one is  one is that one.
actually, justice 
there's nothing wrong if he can detect limburger cheese. that to me is like plain smell.
well, what is the harm 
 and in the course of an attempted felony. say you failed to prove the attempted felony and you proved the remainder of the  the other elements. is he guilty of anything in  under mississippi 
at  at the dismissal stage, our pleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that the pleadings sufficiently assert that there are regulations there that create a  a property interest and that 
that's often the case where  where, in  in order to challenge a governmental action, you  you have to be willing to  to go to court by resisting it.
i don't think the court said in thermtron, so therefore, i have no subject matter jurisdiction.
what do you think it should have been?
and if 
but you're saying  you're  you want us to say that mail is somehow unique. but it isn't. there's all kinds of delivery.
 for 
there were scratches on the thighs.
well, we didn't decide that, in lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. if the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.
well, your honor, under the government's definition of "corruptly," she couldn't have been providing lawful bona fide services.
all of them. all of them is what it says unless i missed something.
your assumption 
but prediction is not knowledge. prediction is not direct knowledge.
and if that's what they wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking; rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to come in, come in, and it is totally relevant.
mr. 
it does not?
but don't they have a short span where they have to bring that administrative claim?
yes. well, yes. the district court could then decide whether in fact they were precluded, and  and it's likely that they were. i didn't follow up on what happened when the case went back down on remand. but the court said, we're not going to decide that. we will allow the district court to address that in the first instance. and so we think that the actually litigated revision of rooker-feldman is simply inconsistent with feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith and credit that is not true to the negative implication from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this court jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate jurisdiction must be  must be narrowly limited to the context, the type of lawsuits that this court would seek, which is not simply they did me wrong, please  please give me money, but rather, that lower court erred. it violated my rights. it is structurally or in some  in violation of federal rights or something that the court did and that you have been asked to fix. that, we think, is consistent with the proper negative implication from 1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is not. for these reasons, we would ask the court to reverse. and, justice stevens, i would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
what did  what did the district court do here? did it grant summary judgement or deny summary judgement?
 there should be no hearing. they're not conceding the violation. they're simply saying the  a violation is irrelevant to the question of the admission of the evidence, so we should not litigate it.
but in california they would? or is there a separate joyriding 
i hadn't thought so. do you think it is?
your honor 
 on most of our rivers.
thank you, counsel. ms. zieve.
i would have thought 
i think that's potentially right 
we do not need 
mr. howe, one of the things that puzzled me about your position is, you said, "under arizona law, while this doesn't come in under mens rea, it does affect sentencing." i think you said that the  his mental state is properly taken into account in the sentencing. and, by that, did you mean just the length of the incarceration, or the place of the incarceration?
that decision also requires unanimity, your honor, and in the one case i'm aware of, kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by colorado. it's  but it's  it takes unanimity to do anything under that compact administration, including the arbitration option.
you're saying, in effect, that derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.
well, they came to that conclusion dealing with whether a career offender provision should include attempted burglary not under the armed career criminal statute and they specifically recognized that. moreover, when they dealt with whether they wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing with career offender, which has, although it increases the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense. so for those reasons, even if the sentencing commission feels that the career offender statute or official guideline should include attempted burglary, that doesn't mean this court should use that for the armed career criminal statute. moreover, the career offender statute says it's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if it's a dwelling or a structure.
your honor 
but then we're not relying on the elimination of the expectation of privacy, because, under my hypothetical statute, the ex-felon would know he's subject to it. so, it has to be something other than the absence of an expectation of privacy. is that correct?
the legislature replaced the court-ordered map, but the court found as a factual matter that the court-ordered map, in the court's words, quote, perpetuated the 1991 democratic party gerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its own map with the same judges.
well, if the patentee in that case 
what about substantially advances a legitimate state interest, which does sound like it's a higher standard? and it has been said, as was pointed out, in several cases of this court  not that it made any difference to the bottom line, but that language is  sounds  sounds like it's a more toothful standard than rational basis.
justice scalia, clearly congress was attempting to change  or to increase the disincentives to reentry. at the same time that they modified the reinstatement provision, they extended the criminal reentry provisions.
if  if you apply 
literally.
right. but i don't see any argument on the other side that's really a constitutional avoidance argument. their principal argument is 
so you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.
 arguing that 
 maybe congress didn't assume that. they probably didn't think about it. but what's wrong with the argument?
if you say that  let me just throw this thought out, so you can comment on it.
you don't concede that that's a state question at all?
not that i know of, your honor. and i 
that's correct, your honor.
well, it's something that i hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the court  to the court of claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the united states district court in california and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case  what is the authority for that? the  the court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings that have been made previous to the transfer?
right. i don't think they could do that. and i don't think that's what happened here. and i think if you look at the evidence in this case  i mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way, in part, i think, because it was a bench trial, but i think what the trial court did is say that, "all of the evidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second phase of the case, is relevant. it's all coming in. i'm going to take it into consideration, but i'm going to take it into consideration only on the insanity defense, not as part of the mens rea defense." and i think that was consistent with arizona law. what i think would be a harder question  and let me just say, i think the way that this was postured for the trial court was that the petitioner argued that all of that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens rea.
well, but doesn't  doesn't that get us back to the fact that those examples were given in crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know, those were  i think the word poor was used. but  but crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not limited to that, why, in effect, does the  does the  should we conclude that the concern of the clause stops short of the self-interested witness even though he didn't make an affidavit?
i agree, but the question isn't whether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether you are still offering telecommunications services to the public. and it seems to me  look it, i offer you broadband, initially without any information function at the end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all sorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what you want, conveying what you want. and then i change my rules and i say, "you know, in the future the only way i'm offering this broadband is if you, in addition to buying the broadband communications capacity, buy my information technology at the end of it." have i suddenly stopped selling the broadband  or offering the broadband to the public? i just don't think that's a reasonable 
yes, but do we have a case that says that, you have to use registered mail?
that's not a  that's not a de novo  they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc tax court, can they not? that's a de novo hearing.
 on appeal.
well, i mean, not ad hoc in that sense, "i'm creating one court for this defendant, another court for the other defendant," but setting up for the occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new court. i don't think that, just because it's a new court, you can say that it's not a "regularly constituted court."
i'm not certain i understand the question.
i thought you had a brown and williamson argument that epa was precluded.
i  i am also concerned about it, and i  i have thought about this. first of all, if they are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the  the precise degree of culpability goes to the people who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them. but even  but with respect to 
and wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this ping-pong?
it's on page 9 of your  of your brief. the 
well, it didn't say that established meant something different. it said it would not consider what established meant. and in deciding what located meant, it didn't say located had some obvious meaning. it said it was going to look at the purpose, and the purpose was the convenience of the bank. and what  what the court did in bougas was to place national banks in a position of parity with state banks with regard to venue. state banks could be sued anyplace they had a branch, and under bougas, national banks could be sued.
in  in your view is the closely related doctrine a  a matter of closely related as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it a matter of  are the facts relevant? for example, could one argue that these offenses were factually related pretty closely because they grew out of the same central group of facts?
take all three. (laughter.)
well, we do believe that where a prisoner brings an open-ended claim of the type at issue here, it would necessarily prevent the state from carrying out the execution in one relevant sense. namely, it would prevent the state from carrying out the execution 
and rule 24 you could.
well, it's important to understand also that, in fact, it would violate the internal revenue code. this rule must be construed to be consistent with the internal revenue code. the internal revenue code makes very clear, and this court held in freytag, that the tax court judge, not the special trial judge, is the decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. this court so held in freytag and the  and the statute makes that very clear. so it would violate the statute to construe this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of deferential clear error review.
right.
 say?
 to what extent does new york take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the states from which this wine is coming? you say we must do this to police for all kinds of things. but don't other states  california, virginia  don't they have laws that their local wineries must meet?
 and that's suspension of deportation 
does that mean that it could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or the friends who talked about this person's illness?
the word "special circumstances" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight. now, that what's confusing me throughout. as i understood this area, to go back to what justice scalia was saying  no, wait, just  i'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding  zant is the key, because zant says, "judge, if you have a 'non-weighing' state"  that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink  "the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point." is that right?
no, but a reading of the rule indicates under (b), as the chief justice points out, that the judge could take into account these policy objectives.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
do we know whether you can be a member of that church without being an indian?
they could have made it 97 percent 
no, but it was to avoid any connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of those words that the government sought the use of the word "impede." and i should note that it appears, in section 1503, section 1505 
they have been under title vi?
that's correct. that's correct, because in our view the schedules  excuse me  in our view the schedules in this case clearly indicate that it  that he was within the statutory limitations, at least as far as the schedules go.
okay. help me  help me out here because i  i just don't remember well enough. i thought that's what judge giles was getting at when he said, you know, he would have been thrown if he hadn't gone through the state procedure. so help me out. is that what he was getting at or not?
that's correct, justice breyer.
and then we have the  we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the uk, with japan. here, you're relying on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out like you do in an extradition treaty. and that's the problem here. sure, if congress had said we mean foreign court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it means in the extradition context or the deportation context where you have a clear statement that congress means a tribunal abroad.
if the board of directors are shell and texaco and if they are the ones who are  the next statement, your honor  the  they  they must  the company must follow the policies, strategies, and standards established by the members committee. the members committee is shell and texaco and saudi.
no, your honor. there are, of course, other differences. as i said to justice scalia earlier, with regard to legislative prayer in chambers versus marsh, this court said that there was a history going back to the very first congress that allowed there to be those kinds of religious invocations. ten commandments monuments standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly are not of that historic origin.
if in fact it goes back to the state court and you litigate it, you lost, can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you? one was a determination in the federal court that you're an organ of a federal state, and second, a bench trial?
do you have a  a section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?
no, justice ginsburg. we didn't ask for that. all i'm saying to you 
very well, mr. chan. ms. blatt, we'll hear from you.
what we are presenting in this case is a dispute about money. it's not abstract. it's not hypothetical. it's not conjectural. it is concrete, immediate. all the facts are in. it's definitely adversarial. it's legal.
 issue for us.
there was nothing in thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.
it would not establish a violation, your honor. in fact, the brooke group court dealt with that very case because the dissent in brooke group pointed out that the district court in that case had held that the intent evidence was amongst the most powerful that had ever been, been presented in any case, and it still said, even though there was a clear evidence of intent 
not quite, justice souter. i would say the nub of your position is the altvater case, the aetna case, the maryland 
no, not the evidence, just the reason.
why should it? the probate exception is court-created. congress passed no law that said it. congress gave the federal courts jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and expected them to exercise that jurisdiction. since our jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it because it lacks any statutory basis?
i'm 
yes.
it was presumed by the weight of that, that was the conclusive evidence.
they were already in evidence and the state incorporated its evidence from the guilt phase into the sentencing phase. it's just a procedure. the only evidence that the state put on in the guilt phase were his prior two convictions and evidence that mr. nixon tortured the defendant by removing her underwear before he burned her alive. besides that, the rest of the evidence was incorporated from the guilt phase.
in  in terms of ineffective assistance?
well, it depends on what you mean by stretch. (laughter.)
now, what do you 
okay. that's without regard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because of the anti-lien provision?
he does have some  some minimal protection under the constitution.
are you prepared to just say, all right, they can do it some, just be careful about it? how far will you go with that?
juror 19  you just said earlier the fact that the one juror's uncle had an alcohol problem was  was a legitimate factor. juror 19's daughter had a  a cocaine problem and this was a cocaine case. isn't that a perfectly legitimate reason for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?
let's assume that you have a really obnoxious court  (laughter.)
 the constitution 
if they had the necessary intent and purpose. they had to have had the specific intent and purpose that it be combined in order to create a device that wouldn't 
well, in the restatement, section 324, under "assumption of a duty," gives an example. and the example is, if a private company hires a scaffolding inspector, and the scaffolding inspector does a negligent inspection, and a worker falls and is injured, the worker has a claim against the scaffolding inspector. and then, under the reliance component is 
yes.
that's the issue 
 protectionism wasn't the only thing that they were concerned about.
large? i mean, they  they don't count it by large 
well, and someone entering says, "well, obviously, if i'm detained the day after i enter, i'm not going to have a very good case. on the other hand, if i'm not, and i happen to make a life here, and i'm here for 20 years, and i get married and i have a child, i'm going to have a strong case," and he's going to  he's willing to take his chances.
'69.
suppose we go back to the first display. if all that was there was the ten commandments, now, in your opinion, was that constitutional?
but i'm talking about step one.
i would just suggest that there is no further evidence other than putting landrigan on the stand to say 
no, but isn't 
the  the least restrictive alternative, which is what puts the teeth in rluipa and what's  what creates the problem 
this court held that in new york indians that article 13 of the treaty which provides that the oneidas agree to remove was sufficient to effect a present grant of the kansas lands and to avoid any forfeiture. so it was much more than an agreement to agree or an offer, if you will. but 
they seem to do both. they  we haven't, of course, seen them in full yet, but they set forth a procedure and then they also say that there is some sort of need, age, indigency, and health-based standard for continuing the support. and if you'll notice 
thank you, mr. waxman.
you don't want to answer yes or no there?
in a hypothetical 
no, but  but we treat prosecutions quite differently. we do not give, for example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as we give absolute immunity to prosecutors.
that is a report.
the case is submitted.
you think congress has the power to prohibit any first amendment contact  conduct that might have an impact on the election? i mean, is that the criterion for whether it  it can be prohibited?
you think this  you think the state has to challenge as unconstitutional a decision of the state supreme court in  in the lower court, lower state court.
all right. let me 
i don't think that i have rejected both the government's suggestions. i've said that they raise problems on  as to the scope of lear.
 they're addressed  is it  they're addressed under state and federal whistle-blower laws, or 
and that's what  you know, that's what starts the 6 years running. and it's  seems to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in fact, an order. they're not complaining about anything; they're saying, "pay the money."
why isn't her response to that argument, look, i've  i've assigned you my rights? there's no question about that. i'm also willing to give you whatever the amount is that they allocated. if  if you want the difference, you've got the assignment. go ahead and sue for it.
well, not forever but for now. this isn't a case in which they came up with the ten commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law. this in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display. it's not a  the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed. what is your response to that?
i think that if there had been 24 hours that had passed, then you would  it would be a factor that you would consider in deciding whether the defendant has initiated the conversation.
mr. moran, before your  your time is up, i did want to know what is your position on  let's say that there is  you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. and if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an anders brief?
all right. then 
and, justice ginsburg, they never sought to name or join that other possible defendant. they never brought a joinder motion. they never even conducted discovery as to whether or not there was another possible defendant that might be affiliated. and their theory of liability made it unnecessary, because their theory of liability was that lincoln property company, the parent, is responsible for all the acts of its agents. and had they really wanted to be in federal court, they could have found plenty of virginia citizens that they could have sued. they could have sued the plumber, they could have sued the installer of a  heating and air-conditioning equipment, they could have sued the general contractors. there are a lot of people they could have sued if they were that intent on staying in federal court. but, instead, they made a tactical choice to sue the deepest pockets. and the deepest pockets happened to be out-of-state citizens that have a right under the statutes to remove the case.
yes.
do you agree with that?
 in both capacities 
well, isn't there something different here? because in  in holmes, the  the party that was claiming the  sort of the ultimate damage was damaged because other people up the line were damaged, the  the shareholders and then the broker-dealers and so on. there was a kind of a direct line of  of causation. but the people who were claiming were at the tail end of it. here, the causation between the  or the  or the cause of the harm to  to the clients on  on the other side was  was direct. it was direct competition harm. so we are in a different situation from holmes. in other words, they  they weren't  the  the plaintiffs in this case were not injured simply because new york lost some money. they were injured in  in their own right by  by the competition between them and your client.
i think, the question is not whether it can preempt state laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank. the statute makes a clear distinction between the two. and the effect of what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't matter.
mr. frederick, you  you started by saying how difficult this would be to prove, but could the plaintiff piggyback on new york? if new york was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the state, has the state had no proceeding in this?
yes, your honor.
i mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. so we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. are we talking just about existing programs that  that the government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the government is at liberty to benefit tribes? and so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? we're still doing good for tribes.
the affidavit is  is not admissible because, by that point, the officer had the information that he needed to resolve the emergency, and what he was soliciting at that point 
in a non-removed case, yes. petitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d) bar, and it was removed to federal court, decided that it was not precluded by slusa and remanded it, this court could not review it directly or indirectly, could not review the issue of slusa preclusion decided by the federal court.
the 
of course not, but this is a  this is a standard which  a constitutional test that looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to human dignity. and in that regard, it is  it is notable that we are literally alone in the world even though 110 countries in the world permit capital punishment for one purpose  for one crime or another, and yet every one  every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders. and, justice kennedy, my submission isn't that that that's set  you know, game, set, and match. it's just relevant, and i think it is relevant in terms of the existence of a consensus. there was reference made by my opponent to the fact that there are four states that set the age at 17 and four states that set the age at 16. no  in terms of movement, no one has suggested that any of those states or any other state has ever lowered the age. in fact, if you look at those particular  those eight states, a number of them legislated an age that represented raising the number over what had previously been permitted. the movement, as this court addressed, talked about in atkins, has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that movement, in and of itself, answers the question. but where you have the type of consensus that exists here, as it did in atkins, and where you have a scientific community that in stanford was absent  the american medical association, the american psychological association, the american psychiatric association, the major medical and scientific associations, were not able in 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this court and say there is scientific, empirical validation for requiring that the line be set at 18.
you're leaving something 
okay.
but i don't 
well, perhaps the  - perhaps the even most clear indication of what the court of appeals viewed this is its citation to jackson as an application of jackson. and in jackson there is no question, because jackson said, quote, "the district court possessed the discretion to raise sua sponte." and the  and the magistrate judge, as the state's counsel, mentioned  in footnote 1 of its opinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that it's raising this at a  as a matter of its discretion. so, remand for the exercise of discretion would be  serve no purpose in this case. if there are no further questions 
i'm not sure entirely what you're referring to as the problem, but it is the case that  that 
how do we know that? now  now, what is the answer specifically in the statute? let's call it document 1 and document 2. and it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when i thought that's the key question. is it? is it that report they're referring to? so now, go ahead.
here you have 
mr. fisher, there's another potential impediment in this case and i would like you to comment on it. that is the petition from the sentence, it was second in time. there was a prior petition that challenged just the conviction, and under the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've got to get permission from the court of appeals and it has to meet stringent criteria. how do you get past that? you went out concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence which is a second petition.
that's right. and it would really advantage wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it, and really disadvantage out of wisconsin dairy farmers, and you think that the commerce clause doesn't speak to that.
just on the merits, the first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they have to value the property.
then there's no defendant.
i don't care. i don't call this an appeal of a remand. what this is, it is an appeal of the determination precedent to remand that powerex is not an organ.
we don't think that's appropriate because, first of all, the  the court of appeals did identify the factors the district court relied on that weighed on  it thought weighed on ebay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected each one of those. but furthermore, we think that this court's enunciation of the tests and the application of the tests, much as it did in the patent case of pfaff v. wells electronics 3 years ago, could provide very useful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a specific, concrete context. but the factors that the court of appeals relied on here and rejected, found insufficient were really quite right. first of all, there should not be an automatic distinction between a party that practices the patent and one that licenses it. they both have 
mr. rosenkranz, just one piece of information. because the ind is so important at this point, is it in the record  do we have a copy of the ind?
it is 
that is  the solicitor general is no longer barred from making that argument, as is evidenced today. what he 
excuse me. how could the  how could the court of appeals not have resolved this issue? how could it possibly have rendered its judgment without resolving this issue?
let me try to clarify that, justice souter. the reason why dsl meets the definition of "telecommunications service" and we don't is because the telephone companies do, in fact, provide the transmission-only component. now, the reason they do that, justice souter, is, as mr. hungar said, historical, though it wasn't without basis in reasons in history, but they do, in fact, provide it separately. they do, because congress required them to do it through a separate subsidiary in computer ii. there were reasons for that. they wanted to avoid cross-subsidies, they were the only platform, they were worried about discrimination.
or that in, i guess in brewer's case in particular, that since the violence was caused by a particular bout of depression, that would not necessarily recur.
we 
it's not based on them giving up their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do is stop paying royalties, and they can sue. they have to 
it often does. it often does. but it does not, universally. and there are a number of instances cited by the petitioner that  where this court and  and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings.
 given  given paragraph 8.
where was that change made from the prior version?
well, i don't 
well, i  i guess, justice breyer 
that's correct, justice ginsburg. it was the school that was  was held to have standing to assert the rights of future and current students, and the same is true of the singleton case where, again, there was no particular restriction against the doctors. it was simply that they would not get funding.
i wouldn't call it a right to convert in bad faith. if it's a right, it's a official right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith. it's not a right to convert in bad faith. no one is arguing for that.
but i  that's why i ask you. is there any protection in the law whatsoever? or if congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see  say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. so it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income. there's no protection in your view against that result. and you just said, well, congress decided to do it, it decided to do it.
both of those statutes, it's been a long time, your honor. i'm not, i'm not totally 
justice stevens, i think that would pose a much greater problem.
there are no vagaries in private enforcement. private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. there are no vagaries there.
so, is it timely?
 to, to apply it to a rico defendant.
thank you, mr. gornstein. mr. phillips, you have four minutes remaining.
in your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing? i know there's an element of discretion in it.
even though we are told by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are basically the same, they start out in the same way and that the difference  the differences are not large in particular cases.
i don't know that, your honor. i've tried to find out what that text is. it is not in hebrew. it is not in a script that anyone was able to recognize. but it is important to notice that if you look at the entire monument, in addition to the ten commandments, there is also a latin symbol of christ, there is also jewish stars of david. and as i was saying in response to justice kennedy's question, imagine the muslim or the buddhist who walks into the state supreme court to have his or her case heard. that person will see this monument and realize it's not his or her government.
that's right. and obviously, as the state suggested, if the state didn't want to stand on the statute of limitations defense because, for example, it was particularly messy, there was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to insist on litigating that issue. but if, for example, the state said, "well, you know, if we didn't stand on this defense, instead this petitioner would go back to the state court, and the state's courts are going to be very hospitable to this claim. we think you're more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it litigated here," it would inappropriate for the state to try to force the federal court to litigate that issue instead of the state court. these are all fact-specific, case-specific considerations. and that's what the court did in granberry. it remanded  after setting aside both extreme positions, it remanded to the court of appeals for a case-specific application of discretion. as to the question of whether the eleventh circuit here believed that there was an absolute obligation, i think that it's relevant to note that, although there was one point at which it said, "the court was obligated to enforce the statute of limitations"  and, of course, that's true if the state has preserved the defense  there were three other points in the court of appeals opinion where it used discretionary or nonmandatory language. for example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said that the district court "may dismiss." at the petition appendix 5(a), it said that the state's failure to raise "does not bar" the court from acting sua sponte. again, at petition appendix 6(a), the state's concession, quote, "does not compromise the authority of the district court." all of those are phrased in more permissive language 
yes, your honor.
and if it turns out that congress doesn't have that authority, i don't see how you can say the state has made an informed waiver, when their theory is, "guess what? you don't have that authority to abrogate."
 it would be true. these parents were fortunate  this child was fortunate, that they were able to pay for brian's services until montgomery county finally changed its mind and gave him the kind of services he had sought from the beginning, services they gave him once they were given the burden of proof. but most parents are not going to be in that situation. most parents of children with disabilities are not going to be able to go out and obtain the services they need if the hearing officer does not award 
do you agree that such residual-doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them? i mean, the question of  that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes that determination doubtful.
california hasn't used this instruction since 1983.
in other words, there's no case, there's no case in texas law which says what i just said?
mr. salmons, you have a little over 2 minutes.
and that's fine, justice souter, i grant you that. but they still have to show that there is reason that it is likely to believe, that the reduction in that tiny fraction of united states emissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95 percent in the rest of the world and what they do, and the evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in those countries are increasing, they have to show the regulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on their alleged injuries, not to completely redress them, your honor. we don't say that 
maybe you could explain to me how this did work. the  the  my understanding, which might be not correct, is we have some facilities that refine gasoline and there are some people who take the gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas stations. now, those facilities and those people now work for one hierarchy of officials called equilon. is that right?
but, mr. mccartan, i don't mean to interrupt you, but i thought the primary issue was not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we have a cause of action in the first place.
but 
we don't think it's invidious, your honor. as a matter of fact 
if you can look at the colloquy and the judge, without incorporating it, has the defendant explicitly admit the facts that constitute the elements of generic burglary, it is our position that that  that conviction could be used to enhance. but 
so, in other words 
1182(d)(5)(a). yes.
we  we believe that the raise a reasonable inference of innocence standard, as the counsel for south carolina said, does not necessarily require that it be the only inference 
in terms of the plating fee?
if i could just clarify, dystar 
now, washington also has an anti-stacking policy, does it?
call it a cable tv franchise fee. i mean, isn't that the way municipalities used to make a lot of money? they charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise and then grant a monopoly in exchange.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i  i have difficulty with that question.
 under factor 18, any other circumstance which they find serves as a basis for a sentence other than death.
yes.
that is a well established federal jurisdiction principle.
no, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. and  and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't  doesn't qualify. i mean, i would think that that's 
no. it's their point. i don't see how it's your point. how can you cover yourself? i mean, if we come out your way, how  how 
is that right? let me  let me  i wanted to ask this question to see whether it's vehicle-specific. suppose i have nine trucks. they're michigan-plated, so i have to pay $100 for each of the nine.
thank you, counsel.
then i guess maybe you could have appealed on that point. so did you?
the sec regulates the  the alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive compensation claims.
well, maybe i misunderstood the thrust of the allegation. i thought the thrust of the allegation was that mohawk was acting illegally in providing phony social security cards.
i certainly do. and the two together, i think, are doubly compelling, because the government  the united states has a compelling interest in encouraging this, and section 801(a) 
may i ask you a question, because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise, about punitive damages? your opponent didn't seem to think it very important, but i have this question. is it your view that the other state waived its claim to the punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the  the issue was before the master the last time around?
exactly.
you're just giving, you're just suggesting we should give them an additional ground for termination.
it depends on whether the state was involved in making that judgment. if the state was cut out of making that judgment, the state can choose to have a default rule.
it was not, your honor, because a guilty plea, as this court talked about in boykin v. alabama, gives up rights of the defendant. the lawyer and the defendant waive rights. they waive the right to trial. they waive the right to have the state prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. they waive the right to have a jury, to confront witnesses, to cross examine, all of the attendant trial rights. mr. nixon  justice
number two 
that may be a very intelligent choice on your part to do what the person with the gun at the head of your children tells you to do. but to say that it's not your choice, which is what you're arguing here, the only question is whether that has to be brought forward by reason of  of a defense of  of coercion or rather, whether it goes to whether you had the intent. that's all we're talking about here. and it seems to me you have the intent to yield to  to the demand of whoever has the gun at the head of your children. it's a separate question whether the law should punish your yielding like that.
and you might want to find out which one it was and  and as here, it seems pretty easy. everybody knows most burglaries are  are of houses. but i'm just wondering if we're not trying to find out what the categorical rule is that  that is at stake here.
we think not, your honor. in the donovan ricky richland case, the court made clear you would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to obey the rules. the court refused to vacate and remand in that case, as we point out in our brief. this is a case such as justice scalia was positing where there is an actual issue of, colorable question of jurisdiction. the proper course would to be to challenge, and here petitioner did not even try to litigate the question, did not file any brief after santos came down, never tried to distinguish this case from santos. he merely waited and did not timely pursue the writ of the guam supreme court, the judgment that was final at that point in time.
mr. brunstad 
 should we, in effect, say there is no distinction between the tribe's position as sovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline-seller.
i think the weight 
the economic result may be the same, but with all due respect, congress has not decreed that the administrative system work this way.
you can ask it as well  (laughter.)
now, if i can continue for just a moment and then i'll stop. there is a new statute, 1226(a) of title 8, part of the patriot act, which allows detention of aliens who threaten our safety or security. presumably that is an option if either of these people is seen to do that.
well, what about  it  it  section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief. what does that include? could it include punitive damages? could it include attorney's fees, do you think?
how about the judge granting a motion to quit at the close of the government's evidence? why isn't that objective?
but the  but the  but the scheme of  but the class of activities that have been authorized by the state of california will take people out of 
yes, there is. the manufacturer can contract for it. the manufacturer can decline to deal with people who don't provide it. the very same point that was being made earlier. i think that the point here is that permitting resale price maintenance would be such a drastic change in the longstanding settled interpretation of the sherman act that it doesn't really qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making antitrust rules under the sherman act. if that change is to be made at all, it should be made by congress and not by this court.
 1991, it said, "no statute of limitations applies to us." then, in what year did the statute  was passed which said, "and you can collect money out of social security payments for higher education"?
well, what is the statutory  what is the mens rea under the statute for the offenses that the defendant was charged with? it's knowingly, isn't it?
you don't know whether that would have been the magnet or the so-called resides school or somewhere else?
thank you, mr. baughman.
but it does 
 isn't that a harmless error analysis rather than a  a subsection (4) analysis?
so, there's not an article iii lack of case or controversy, which is 
yes, but i mean you don't have exactly what i was driving to. i was quite interested that you said there are 11 other provisions that we could look at for support, and i wouldn't think it was support if those consider  concern administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern some other 
well, we 
if they apportion it, however, it is  it is not  it does not  if they put it into the irp, it is not part of the registration process. the thing that the 
they make it fairly clear that they may only have the evidence of parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a summary judgment. but how you can say this is not an allegation of fact, i find mind-boggling.
 jeering and picketing if a black person came to recruit and people didn't  and a school faculty didn't like blacks?
i  i believe your honor is correct in that it  it's a direction by the gao to acquire data. and i believe we argued that point in our brief, just as your honor has expressed it. we think that that direction to the gao, however, does not relate back particularly and  and certainly doesn't inform this court or inform the statute that expert's fees are to be included and shifted over to the  to the school district.
well, the  if it's isolated examples that are unconnected to any perception of corruption at that level, then it would not be adequate on  on its  on its  by itself. now, of course, in shrink, the court cited to both actual and perceived evidence of corruption at the level that the  you were considering that limit.
oh, no, your honor.
what  what about damages? do  do you take any position on whether the communications act provision enables damages to be collected?
of course, we could separate the home from the  from what happened here and still validate the search here if we held that it was a search, but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the person was carrying contraband. it's the only thing that's disclosed. whereas, if you  if you did the same thing with  with regard to a house, which is a more sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an unreasonable search. we  we could reach that result if we wanted to, couldn't we?
 this question? the case is a little bit on the border, because it's a slip-and-fall, and it does  there may not have been negligence. we  but we're assuming, via the allegations, they're true. but your position would apply to an intentional tort, as well as a negligent tort, i think, wouldn't it?
i must say i agree with justice souter. it seems to me if you say  you're saying it doesn't make sense, so you got to pay for it. i think it  it's much more reasonable to say it doesn't make sense, so you can't do it. why isn't the latter the  the intelligent reaction?
i believe that along with other factors such as the constant complaints to congress about how clecs had the better side of the deal than the ilecs, along with the pledges of the defendants that they would do, and that they didn't do.
justice  judge mcconnell and several other courts have focused on the types of relief that an alien was eligible for as of the effective date of iirira. we think that's the wrong first inquiry. we think that the way to approach the stage two analysis is on a categorical basis, because congress, in the statute, said that, at the time of reentry, the mere act of reentry wouldn't categorically preclude you from seeking any forms of relief from deportation. and so, had congress wanted to change that, it would have  it would have had to do so retroactively on a categorical basis. but even if one accepts judge mcconnell's analysis of the forms of relief you're entitled to as of that date, at the very least, at that point, my client would be eligible to seek both voluntary departure and cancellation of removal. we think he'd  also should be eligible to seek adjustment of status, because, although it's true that he is not  he was not, at that point, married to his now-wife, adjustment of status was a  is a defense from deportation, and he would have been able to get married even if put into deportation proceedings. and given that, at that point, he and his now-wife had  already had a 8-year-old son 
that's absolutely 
it's  it's both contemporaneity, if i've said that correctly, but i think also a  a reason to infer that it provided the basis for the plea  for the plea colloquy, which it is in this case because 
that's an audacious statement. (laughter.)
per se  per se violations are put to juries all the time, justice scalia. the question is you have to prove that that's what they did. i agree with the court in this way. i agree. i don't think it  i don't think it should go to trial. i think this court should do as it did in citizens publishing and make it very plain to everybody that you're not going to allow them to use a joint venture as a cover, even though it is legal 
but you do have a case  anywhere, forget antitrust. suppose it's a tort case, and the following complaint is filed. my foot hurts. i've gone to dr. smith for 15 years. i claim he is negligent. is that valid?
well, it's always a technicality. what you're saying is, the only time that the state can do that is when the answer to the statute of limitations is unclear. and i'm saying sometimes the state may say, "the answer is clear, but doggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too technical in this particular case."
that's  that's possible.
you  you  i  i believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps. now, i'm  when i think something like this, i'm quite often wrong. but i thought that the reason that exhaustion is required is not always because statutes require it. it's partly because of the word final in the apa, which applies here as well, and it's also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies.
and he says i  i would have brought it anyway.
correct.
it's over.
well, yes, your honor, unless there is a compelling need. and the difficulty with the solomon amendment 
the  the credibility  the due regard and presumption of 
well, wherever the line is, suppose they're just  they're just slightly on the wrong side of the line?
well, let me ask you a law school question. in  given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?
i would say ordinarily this court is not in as good a position as a state court to conduct harmless error analysis. our belief here is that the, the basis for the state finding the error harmless was a very unusual rejection of the conclusion that this, these instructions would facilitate consideration of mitigating evidence.
on the petition date itself, he was not. and if you look at schedule i, which is at page 30 of the supplemental joint appendix, at the bottom line, bottom of the  and it indicates that he was in the process of having a second tenant in his official rental property and that he was beginning a job at about the time the petition 
do you  do you think it is unconstitutional for a state to say, "we know perfectly well that it is much more difficult for both cognitive and reason  reasons  and reasons of character and training and so on, for some people to conform themselves to the criminal law than others. we know it's harder for some than others. but we don't care how much harder it is, unless it gets to the point that we define as insanity. because unless we require something as serious as insanity to excuse, everybody's going to have an excuse, and there isn't going to be any criminal law"  is that unconstitutional?
no. and  and i think this illustrates a point. under washington law, the state could charge assault three with a firearm enhancement in  in a case in which a person used a gun. there's nothing under washington law that requires the prosecutor to charge the greatest offense. there's nothing under federal constitutional law that even if that greater offense is charged, that the jury must return a verdict on that greater offense. in fact, the jury, as the circuit breaker in the system, has always  always has the right, regardless of the strength of the evidence and regardless of  of what the trial court might view as the correctness of the charge, to return the verdict on the lesser.
your honor, that is not  not the rule applicable here because that rule applies in a different context. that applies at an earlier stage of the post-judgment proceeding.
i am not saying that. what i am saying is the occ does not have the exclusive right.
but who's fault is that that the jury instruction is too general. i mean, if both parties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?
no. we're saying that he first has to attempt to persuade the union to seek arbitration. that is, he has to make all reasonable efforts to utilize the full range of administrative remedies. but it  our  our position is if the union declines that request, then judicial review would be available at the end of the day in federal district court.
in other words, the  the  mr. chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to  to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was  quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. with respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?
to his opinion in this  in the decision. it will take me a second to find it. his opinion in the meritcare v. st. paul. in a footnote, he acknowledges  what he says is he was upset that 
yes.
well, how 
what was the claim here as to  was part or all of that  it would be some $54,000.
but here  here, the intimidation was  was not directed to your customers. i mean, it seems to me that's a  that's a totally different situation. had  had your customers been defrauded, that would be a  your customers, but you  there  there was nothing directed specifically at the customers of your store.
i'm not sure how you can avoid also the trustee being one of the named plaintiffs.
well 
and it actually says it wasn't a question. it was a statement, and that's why i can't figure it out.
how do we know what you've just told us? is that in the record? you're just assuring us what the content of the insurance contract is. right? but we don't have the insurance contract.
but it is  it is true that the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express reference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the  cite the 1091(a).
sure.
your honor, our position is that if, if the resulting  if the racial composition of those schools is not the result of past de jure segregation 
one thing leads to another. right?
comparatively late over the course of 14 this case. the counsel had already done things in that 15 respect that would have led them to conclude that there 16 would be no profit in  in searching out additional 17 records.
 in this case.
that happened a week ago.
the pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?
mr. nolas, are you telling us 10 that all that information would have  was in the file 11 that described the  the criminal history that the 12 prosecutor used in his case?
again, had 
it says  yes, it says "any felony." and that is our  doing it  and what 
well, justice 
it's involuntary.
the only cases that would go into court are cases where the employer says, "i have no reason at all for firing him"?
i can understand, i think, what a teaching is. i take it a teaching is you put all the prior art  that's what i guess that's what judge rich explained, which i thought was very enlightening to me in i can't remember the name of the case, wigmore, winsmore 
one further  on further wrinkle. what if the contract goes the further step and says, "even if the patent were determined, in any action, to be invalid, there will still be a royalty payable, because that's what  that's  that is consideration for the fact that we are not going to start any controversy now." let's assume they assume, precisely, the invalidity. would you say the contract is unenforceable then, and the  and the 
your theory would cover the case where the ftca claim drops out because the employee didn't file the administrative claim within the  what is it? 6 months?
that's all right. i'm  i  i'm happy with the first one, at this point. [laughter.]
no, i'm suggesting a tax on imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.
so far.
well, but doesn't vicious will mean simply the will to commit the crime?
 provision.
if it's a felony under either one, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?
why is that, that the best bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this business, rather than the more traditional banking approach.
well, i was just admiring your  your proposal in that at least it relied on something that the lower courts are used to applying. i mean, yes, is there enough to go to the jury? my goodness, it's a standard test. but you've suddenly destroyed it all by saying it isn't quite that because, you know, if it's  if it's really close, the tie goes to the plaintiff, which is an unusual way for the tie to go. the tie usually goes to the other side.
thank you, mr. goldstein. the case is submitted.
mr. verrilli, your  your friend's argument about the interrelation between (a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one. what is your answer to that?
well, we have accommodated choice to the extent there are seats available. and then we go to family connections. and then we  in operation, admit everyone who lives close to the school. and then as to those that live further away, we look to see what's the school's racial demographic. is it significantly different than the community's? these schools we have talked about have been the objects of significantly more aggressive segregation efforts, and the board wanted to preserve those.
 the allegation i'm looking for  and i  i guess you probably didn't  you didn't have to raise it below, given the state of the ninth circuit law i would suppose. but in your brief in opposition, where is it raised that this interferes with the contract between you and  between mcdonald and jwm?
possibly, but 
your honor, sorry for interrupting.
yes. but your honor, ultimately i think that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. and  and so far we have not touched on the question of whether these parties 
but it wasn't discussed by the ninth circuit, was it?
mr. feldman, we'll hear from you.
all you do is you get a bell curve and you ask the library of congress and they'll do it 
 aren't sovereign.
because i assume the tax rate will be changed, so it's not just  there's no 
but  but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no state law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank. and i began to think it fields preemption. am i right in thinking that it is conflict preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?
well, what would this board have to have in order for it not to be temporally limited in your opinion? any plan can be changed in the future. so why does the fact that this can be changed in the future make it a plan that has a temporal limitation?
of course in the brooke case, it may not have even been a monopolist.
which dictionary shall i look at?
even when it's not a body of water.
thank you, mr. gornstein. mr. jett, you have 4 minutes remaining.
what happens with the transaction causation? because i think you'd probably say with your transaction causation in the  in the case that the  that the lie wasn't there, we wouldn't have bought the stock.
well, what  what do you say to justice breyer's argument that we haven't previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to trace the causal connection between a particular piece of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that was broken? what we have said in the past is if the rule or the standard is violated and the search is therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in. you're proposing a  a different causal analysis. you're proposing a causal analysis that requires the connection between a piece of evidence and the particular reason for one of these standards in every case in which suppression is  is requested. number one, do you agree that that  that would be a departure, as justice breyer suggested? and number two, what would be the justification for that?
justice scalia, our position on what the purpose of the assistance of counsel clause is  is drawn from what this court has said that purpose is in the way that it's elaborated it. and i think that if the court looks at the spectrum of contexts in which the court has applied the sixth amendment right to counsel, it's apparent that the most fundamental aspect of the guarantee and the one that is most indispensable to protecting the fairness of a trial, which is the overarching goal of the sixth amendment, is that the defendant have counsel by his side at all.
i am not aware of any case  -
what's wrong  can you tell me, on the face of it, what's wrong with it? i mean, i  if i have tea at 5 o'clock, i think i'm drinking a solution that includes the little things that come out of the tea leaves. and that's what we've got involved here.
unlike in a non-prison setting, there aren't other rights to be balanced. in the prison setting, not only are you balancing the inmate's right to be free from discrimination, but you're balancing the  the rights of all inmates to be free from harm, and as well as the prison officials' duty to protect them from harm. and that is what 
mr. gornstein, one thing i'm curious about. with all the trouble of various interpretations and famous footnote 49 
no, i don't think she needs to do that in the heat of the moment. but later on once she's discovered the true facts, then at that point i think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student if he was not there as a student.
so  so wesley would have neither a  a due process claim with respect to sentence nor with respect to guilt.
i thought the department of interior reached a settlement agreement in which they told the line people at blm to stop.
yes.
but i thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.
you  you made an argument a moment ago which included the point that he asked for this particular relief and represented what he needed to do if he got the relief, the continuance. you  you came right up within a step of  of making a judicial estoppel claim, although you did not use those terms. i have two questions. did the government raise at least the  the theory of judicial estoppel in the litigation before it reached this point? and the second question is, even if the government did not raise that term, asked for  for estoppel to be applied in those terms, did the government make the same argument that you have just made which emphasizes the fact that he asked for it and he represented the reasons for  for needing it?
well, i don't know what else it is. what do you think it is that causes you to seemingly accept the characterization that this is not it?
no. first of all, this court didn't find that there was a violation in the  in the damage in property; this court found no  did not find, as a matter of law, any fourth amendment violation. but i read the ramirez  that language from ramirez as saying that as long as the entry remains lawful  and, in ramirez, the entry was lawful, because there were valid grounds to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. you had a known dangerous fugitive, who had bragged that he wouldn't be taken alive. and so, there was every reason for the officers to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. therefore, the entry was legal. they had both authority  that is, the warrant  and they had a valid entry  that is, a no-knock entry that was justified by reasonable suspicion that the officers would be met with violence if they did knock and announce their presence. and so, we  in ramirez, we have a lawful entry. the language that's quoted from ramirez directly says, "the entry remains lawful," or words to that effect. and you have a different case if you had 
to me it  it suggests that even the corps recognized that at some point you've got to say stop because logically any drop of water anywhere is going to have some sort of connection through drainage. and they're  they're stopping there, and i wonder if we ought to take that same instinct that  that you see in subsection (7) and apply it to your definition of tributary and say, at some point, the definition of tributary has to have an end. otherwise, you're going to go and reach too far, beyond what congress reasonably intended.
well, i mean, that goes to the exact point, justice scalia, because we're not  the question is what is stealing. the question 
thank you.
i'm not sure about that, but 
i believe that's correct. i mean, although i guess 
no, but the question is does the presumption make any sense at all outside of the requirements context.
mr. feldman, is there any case in which the supreme court newly recognizes a right in which it does not initially recognize the right?
that's correct.
you're arguing the facts and the inferences. you said the seventh circuit got it right. as i read their articulation of the standard on page 20a of the petition appendix, it's the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the pslra. could a reasonable person infer  congress passes a law saying they've got to give rise to a strong inference. shouldn't that have changed the standard?
my answer to that is, it would not be valid, your honor, because a person, having served his time on parole, the state's overwhelming interest in supervision has ended. the state has determined that that person, having successfully completed his period of parole 
so you're saying the objective  the  the objective officer always knows at least as much as the officers actually know.
no. they used  they  they abstained under the pullman doctrine which, as this court has explained, is a procedure that is akin to the certification process where states use it. but in any event, no one  when  no one would have thought for a moment that having gone to litigate that state law issue in state court, if they had lost, england  the chiropractors could come back and say, okay, we think that we shouldn't have to comply with this law for two reasons: one, because we're not covered by the law even though the louisiana courts thought so; and two, if we were, the fourteenth amendment would prohibit it. they  the question on which you granted review is limited to those issues, and there is a fair question on the record in this case whether any of those issues are really before the court now. but as to those issues, for which williamson county requires that a party resort first to state procedures, whether issue preclusion applies, and the  the extension of england by analogy to this would dictate the answer yes. it may not apply if  if you extend england to all other types of issues that a party may litigate along with their williamson county ripening exercise. but the very determination that federal law requires them to obtain under state law, prior to stating a ripe federal constitutional claim, of course, gets issue preclusion. now, the question was asked 
we should leave it up to the legislature of the state of missouri to resolve those questions.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
and let me ask you this question, too, on that subject. do you think that the exemption that the state allows for resales to the united states is constitutionally compelled?
so you  you give no significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had already been curtailed to a significant extent?
i mean, i think you're  you're correct that you could do that in the general run of cases under the administrative 
and they're valuing it for tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation.
but you  you still haven't given a reason, other than the one justice souter accepts. look it. this is a case where we all know what the truth is, but you want to argue that we shouldn't find that out. and it seems to me you have to give us a rationale for we shouldn't know the truth here. you  you don't want us to find it, and there must be some reasons for that. and the law does that once in a while. we all know that something happened, but the law is supposed to pretend it didn't. that's why justice has a blindfold on. i  i know that. but you haven't given me one reason yet why i should adopt your theory.
thank you, mr. chemerinsky. the case is submitted.
well, only with the caveat, though, is that i think this court really didn't have to confront the second concern because it had the first concern. and if you thought that a leg, which this court did, was a substantial portion, and that was the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either way it was covered no matter what your purpose was, because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to induce fetal demise. here the compound mens rea requirement works with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel with the purpose of performing an overt act that will, will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you don't even have the intent to take it out of the  past the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're trying to do something that's going to take place in utero. if i could reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
well, there are two problems. there's the concept  i mean, there's 
okay. but you're saying it is an unreasonable search for her to lead the police officer to the straw.
i think that their theory, your honor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and that 
 and embarrassed them?
as this court noted in hood, the bankruptcy decisions regarding the discharge are in rem and, of course, are binding upon the state. but what we have here is not an in rem proceeding. as this court noted in nordic village, an action to recover a preferential transfer claim is not an in rem proceeding. rather, as this court noted in schoenthal versus irving trust in 1932, and granfinanciera versus nordberg in 1989, actions to recover preferential transfer are much like actions to recover a contract claim. that is, like a contract claim, they do not involve the core bankruptcy proceedings, but, rather, involve matters that are  or controversies that are tangential to the core bankruptcy proceedings. they're nothing more than an attempt to augment the state. and where we would draw the line, and where we propose that this court draws  draw the line  and a line that we believe is consistent with this court's previous decisions  is that the states are bound by discharge, the states are subject to the automatic stay, but the trustees' attempts to obtain monetary judgments, and thereby augment the value of the estate, are barred by sovereign immunity.
mr. bopp, to what extent can we take into account the surrounding circumstances? one thing that you advocate is to look at this ad in isolation. but if you add to it that your organization made it clear that it opposed the candidacy of senator feingold and that it supported his opponents, that your organization also connected, as justice breyer just brought out, senator feingold with this filibuster, and then if the filibuster was such an important thing for grassroots lobbying, why was it that when the election was over, this ad was not repeated?
well strangely enough in this case i was looking at statistics as to the average length of time that a case was pending before, between conviction and the filing of the 2254, and mr. lawrence's petition was filed within days of what the average was before the aedpa. that comes up in a statistical analysis i believe by the department of justice cited to by the state.
all right, but that's 
 telling us about the administrative waiver proceeding? you were in the middle of it and i never heard the 
that's exactly.
justice ginsburg, i don't think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did. as your honor noted, this was a sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward departure. the judge at least four times in this transcript brought up section 3553, recognizing that the judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the purposes of sentencing and the factors that were presented to him. now he did that and he made comments along the way that indicate why he did not find physical condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this defendant a lower sentence. and in his ultimate explanation, though it is brief, he pointed to two of the section 3553 factors explicitly. he pointed to the seriousness of the offense and he pointed to the need for public protection. now if you look at the legal obligations that the judge had under section 3553(c) to explain himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of three different levels of explanation. first, in any case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence. second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24 months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end of the range. and finally, if the sentence is outside the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for a sentence outside the range. that statutory framework makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge imposes a guideline sentence and explains, i see no reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met his burden of explanation without having to respond literally and in sequence to each argument that the defendant has made.
and let me come back to my question. this statute simply says that she will assign her rights to recover for the medicals. she has done that. she has also given you the portion of the settlement which she and you agree is attributable to the medicals. why isn't the statute satisfied if she simply says, you've got your assignment? if you want the difference between what i've given you and your out-of-pocket expense, sue. you have the assignment. you have the right. go ahead and sue for it.
but why shouldn't a setoff be a defense, even if it's unrelated? i mean, there were such things in  at common law, were there not, that you could set off an unrelated debt?
what we're saying here is that this is a possible basis on which the oregon supreme court might have decided this case. they did not decide it on that case  on that ground. they decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt, not because of that provision of the statute, but because of the eighth amendment. and 
 i  i would say yes.
it might be, but it's not been my experience that either  either the criminals or certainly innocent parties, people  probable cause, after all, doesn't mean certainty. people who have had damage done or physical injury occur have been  are shy about suing the government in those circumstances.
well, i think gordon is very informative on that point. it rejected primary jurisdiction because the agency's views were already known to the court. here the sec has filed a 40-page submission in the district court explaining that the suit has to be dismissed because of conflict with the administrative scheme.
they're interested in criminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera.
so  so this  i mean, that's what i don't understand what this case is about because i  i'm amazed that  i think it is too detailed what they're requiring of you, by far. but the elements are i have to know. i'm an inmate. i want to know what is this about. suppose i think they're wrong. i need to know how to tell them they're wrong. and the other thing i think i'd need to know is after the committee or the warden decides against me, what are his reasons. i'm not asking for a book. all i want to know are the basic reasons. now, those things i can't work out from the briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him those new things, those two things, or doesn't.
if they each do 100,000 miles of intrastate business in michigan 
 ms. smith, may i  your time is getting short, and i want to get clear on one thing. as i understand it, your argument is not an argument that the husband, in this case, lost an expectation of privacy. you are not arguing that he has no right to object. am i correct on that?
  are saying 
yes, that's right. and what the federal circuit is saying, you have  what it's saying is, if you just look to capability, and that is, could you put asano together on pin 54, you will miss the most important part of invention. and that is, invention isn't at the end when you put the two things together. invention is finding the problem, deciding what pieces of the prior art to use, and deciding how to put them together. everybody is always capable of, it will always be the case, i think, that a practitioner of the art can put them together. remember the very point of a patent, when you look at our patent at the end of the case, we were required to explain it in great detail.
do you have  do you have any empirical basis for your statement that many warrants are executed and they don't find anything?
one of those laws might be, i mean, let's say they have a law, when you're issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them a disclosure about how much they're going to end up paying over the life of the loan and all that. and they require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in michigan. could that law be applied to your subsidiary?
yes, your honor. his testimony was that he was giving, he believes he was giving permission up to and including deadly force.
no. we read segura. we read segura, which happens to be a case 
but you would say that if the state met that burden and there was no mitigating or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be permissible to  for the state to mandate the death penalty.
they simply hold, your honor, in their opinion that this is what the voters intended.
i think it will depend on whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a  in a  in the federal system would have been sentencing hearing. and remember, sometimes 
i  i think that they had  19 obviously, in retrospect, the court files would have been 20 helpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court 21 files would give them more information.
 that's because 
correct? i'm sorry. that is correct? i  i thought that this warrant does not say you can enter the house without knocking. i mean, i have a warrant. this warrant lets me search the house in daytime. i search it in nighttime. is my search authorized?
 two purchases 
well, there  to answer your questions, your honor, first, there was no indication at this conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused about whether they could consider any particular evidence as being mitigating. the conference itself was called to address, as you mentioned, the jurors' concern  or the jurors' inquiry about the result  what would happen if they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in this case.
i believe that it could be removable because it could still involve the application of the federal law 
yes, your honor. the state liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this, but presumably what they would say is, you could share a space, provided that the physical property of each winery, the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in and check whether or not each winery's products conform with their records. there are other reasons why a physical presence is important, as well. first of all, the state draws on local law enforcement extensively to identify illegal activities, and that would not be possible with any entity located out-of-state. additionally 
yes.
under washington law, a defendant gets a lesser included instruction so long as the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, would support the fact that the lesser was  was included. now, it can't turn on whether or not the state  or whether the jury simply disbelieves the state's proof, but it can  when looking at the  the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, look at holes in the state's evidence, such as the fact that there is no evidence before this jury about this gun's capacity to fire.
i respectfully disagree with you, justice ginsburg. the  if the state court gave preclusive effect to the federal court judgment, the preclusion question would be open to question  the collateral estoppel question would be open to review. but the substance of the remand order would not be. it would still be barred by 1447(d), if petitioners are right, and this court held exactly that in the missouri pacific railroad case in 1896 and has never revisited that. so that we cannot get the slusa issue up back through the state system. judge easterbrook was exactly right. it is now or never, your honor. and congress certainly could not have expected on an issue of this magnitude where it passed a law 3 years after the pslra 
adjacent to what? adjacent to a tributary. right?
that's correct, but there was  but  but in ohio there's a requirement to have an actual prove-up of the aggravating factor itself. and they argued that there was ample evidence, quote/unquote, pointed to stumpf as the killer, and that's in joint appendix 186 to 187. ultimately they  and they urged that he was the shooter. then when the wesley trial took place, at the trial they did the same thing. they used the same terms, quote/unquote, ample evidence that wesley was the shooter. they urged a finding that wesley was  was the shooter.
your honor, i would  i would disagree with that. and i would point the court, in particular, to a recent case out of the seventh circuit, jones versus wilhelm. the seventh circuit has announced the position  it decided the position that we advocate. there are many cases, your honor  the courts  the courts are replete with them  where people 
i think  i think that the federal tort claim act does not apply to private citizens in washington.
yes, your honor.
no, of course not because  because the word is committed there refers to the claim of a plaintiff. doesn't it?
justice scalia, no. in fact, the analysis, if you look at this one potential application, this  the standard applied by the court of appeals in this case goes well beyond even a substantial overbreadth test that is applied by this court in the first amendment context.
do they, in all those property cases, you know, from like the early part of this republic where property law was determined in accordance with  you know all those cases that are cited.
well, the point here that remains is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction. now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly argue about that. official
well, no, it's standard law of agency. it doesn't make any difference. the prisoner is denied his rights. as justice stevens said, there may be three or four different people who concurred. do your rules say that if he can't find out with reasonable efforts that he doesn't need to, or does the sixth circuit rules say that the delegation of the names is not required?
certain statements. there are were many objections made here that were overruled.
but it's still very vague.
so you're saying they have abandoned the argument?
where  where do we  you're going to have to help me out then. where  where in the  the pleadings or the  the papers do we get into the social  do we get the allegations of the social security card?
well, it's not an indictment because it did not allege the essential facts.
well, how about y in my example?
i should think your response is that congress provided for only equitable relief.
on 
both, your honor. they need both. they need 
the highest court in maryland also credited the finding.
 because it's very easy to me to reach the outer limit of my understanding.
i have it now, yes. the  the ohio  the ohio supreme court simply  simply used  simply used some sort of circular reasoning. they  they hung to the position that stumpf was the shooter, and then after that 
but it's not  not clear from 
i 
because one could  one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.
that's what they do when they site the school. they said, you know, we'll get a rough whatever it is, 40-60 mix.
justice o'connor, i would say the  the consequences of not affirming are even more severe. congress, in 1964, made a clear decision that it wanted small businesses not to be burdened with 
well, does it matter if, for instance, in today's world on capitol hill we're concerned about terrorist attacks. what if the dog is trained to alert to explosives? now, can the police just decide they're going to sniff any car that's parked on capitol hill?
mr. chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. i thought that you were not challenging  at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging  the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. do i understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?
whether they're 
yes, because the reasoning the fcc would give simply would not be a permissible construction of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b).
 that they write into the contract  the party who's the licensee says, "and we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is invalid." nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for business reasons. therefore, the licensee and the licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he can go into court and challenge the patent." so, we assume that's written into the contract.
no, i know payton was an aedpa case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not unreasonable for the california supreme court to read instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be considered. and i would have thought, if it was not unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary reading that you're proposing, and that the ninth circuit adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated by existing precedent.
well, actually, the united states' allegations in the case were trying 
in other words, a  i mean, you could go in  i see that. but what  is there any authority for that, that just one  a head-to-head competition, he bought the truck. let's  keep that out of it, so imagine they bought the truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such there probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with other dealers, and they lost at least one sale. that's not enough to prove an injury to competition?
i would disagree with that. all we know in this case from the record is that he was not charged with 487(d) car theft, which requires an intent to steal. he was rather charged under a conviction which covers joyriding. in my reading of the government's brief, the government doesn't contest that joyriding would put a statute outside the generic definition of theft offense. even in the government's presentation today, the government suggested that in most states joyriding would be outside the generic definition of 
well, your  i'm just informing your honor what the segura case says. it says the court  the courts would have found  excuse me  the officers would have found the same evidence that they found pursuant to the warrant if they had complied with the fourth amendment. that's because the court viewed the  that warrant as a separate independent source for the authority to enter and conduct a search. one would have to posit, i guess, that the officers in this case, if they  if they would rather not execute the warrant than delay a few additional moments before entering, but i think that would not be a very realistic hypothesis.
 is  is 
i think it was in the context of a freestanding right, but let's leave that aside.
and the ambiguity is the word "increase," which could mean different things?
why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter. why wouldn't it be wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind of consequential liability is part of the general law of aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief? so that would be the narrower ground.
that's correct. that's correct. but what 
well, i believe 
yes, your honor.
well, but you might have probable cause, but just not have the  have the warrant. so, what is the difference between having probable cause to enter, but failing to get a warrant, and having a warrant, but failing to knock and announce?
and as a matter of policy, i wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.
are they likely to do that?
what's 
no. i've paid for eight, but i haven't paid for the ninth. as i read the michigan law, it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over the highways of this state while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid. now, if  if i can't operate the other eight because i haven't paid for the nine, that sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.
i don't think 
and it includes ira's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the internal revenue code.
then in page 22 and 23, you go ahead and you talk about wisconsin versus yoder, lefkowitz versus turley, bordenkircher, which i think was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges. all of those are in the  every one of these cases are in the context of a criminal proceeding. griffin, a murder case. it's just alleging a constitutional 
 "independent standing" 
sorry.
i'm sure they do grant them. but i'm concerned about the, we'll say, the doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind. under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always going to be to subject somebody to trial.
oh, all right.
but i'm submitting it cited it for the wrong conclusion.
 in mcconnell, the court said corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads during election blackout periods by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates or, in doubtful cases, by paying for the ad from a segregated fund. now, that language indicates, to me at least, that the court was saying there are no genuine issue ads meeting the definition as you would have us apply it here.
i've read your reference to those documents. explain why you think that's so important.
well, they  there is an interest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here, too, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for the court to put limitations under this first category of rule 4 and say that the court must, on its own, look at limitations every time, without assistance from the parties, than it is to make the state do its job. i mean, they're the ones, as this 
 but i'm just wondering if it isn't  if it isn't the logical conclusion of your position that it really doesn't matter, even if there is a monopoly in the tying product.
correct.
in that 
the first point of clarification on that is the question  the question is does strict scrutiny apply.
are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the cherokee nation case and the one in the federal circuit? are  are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?
think of a  think of a mall. think of a bunch of shops. maybe it doesn't. maybe they could compete. the reason that  the law says they don't have to compete is because the law thinks in general it's a reasonable way to run a department store without forcing your sales people to compete. and similarly, a joint venture. you can't prove they have to have the price set at a central place, but the reason they set it at a central place, because it's a joint venture. and that's seems to me what the cases are consistent with. you tell me which one is it.
is to interfere with canadian's collection of their taxes. that's the only reason for it.
but why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the wilson act, which has had the words "to the same extent and in the same manner," and the webb kenyon act, which became the second section of the twenty first amendment, leaves out "to the same extent and the same manner." it just says that "alcoholic beverage so that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use therein, in violation of laws thereof." it doesn't say "nondiscriminatory laws."
but i thought that was the point of your argument, that there are assays and then there are other methods. did i misunderstand you?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry, justice breyer.
 in the second proceeding.
well, because the claim would have to be brought on behalf of the child, because they would not have the capacity to bring the claim itself, the award would go straight to the, to the guardian, who may be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf.
well, let me go back to the criminal provision for a second. i take it your answer to the question i asked your brother a moment ago is that if the individual reenters, and, hence, has committed a criminal offense, and later voluntarily returns to  in this case, to mexico, that the criminal violation, in effect, would not, in any sense, be canceled out.
that is a question that would arise under lear against adkins. and the question before this court in that situation, if it got to this court, would be, is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy that was so firmly expressed by justice harlan in lear, and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of this court?
we do think that's covered. and under  the department of labor's approach is to treat a required wait for an activity as an integral part of that activity. so, if that activity is, itself, compensable as a principal activity, then the required wait for that would also be 
well, that's what  with the purpose that we're talking about now 
it wouldn't matter.
the question is not what motivated the prosecutor unless and until the step one showing can be made.
sure.
how  putting aside  putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?
i suppose the position of the respondent is that the minute there's an entry after the knock violation  the no-knock violation  - the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so that it's different from a warrantless rummaging-around through drawers and so forth. i suppose that would be their argument.
as  as a matter of federal law.
our side agrees, your  justice breyer, with  with the concept that this matter should be returned to the compact administration to resolve the differences in that forum.
and his judgment, though, is there will be probable cause when the triggering event occurs.
that  that's true, justice ginsburg, and  and it  it proves my point more than refutes it, and here's why. great-west had no  this court in great-west had no occasion to explain when something was traceable or when it belonged in good conscience to the plan. it merely said that you look to history for those requirements. and this is why, justice scalia, i distinguish between equitable restitution and an equitable lien by assignment. they were both typically available in equity as narrow exceptions to getting money for breach of contract. i concede that. but they had very different requirements, neither of which can be met in this case.
do you think, then, we have to either put it aside or amend it?
yes.
to send a message. and if you don't send a message, chaos will prevail and the animals will reign in the jungle.
yes. immediately 
all right.
well that means, that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this court, but doesn't want to lose out on the possibility of seeking federal habeas, that prisoner has to do two things at the same time: one, prepare a petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare a complaint to file in a federal district court. that's a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't represented.
if  so  in any case, at  at the moment that you got the warrant, you  you had, in fact, a  a finding by a trial court, or a  whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was probable cause to believe that you were going to confront guns as well as drugs inside. and  and richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a basis for  for dispensing with the knock.
mr. poe, i  i  why do you rely only upon the damage to the republican and democratic parties? i frankly don't care much about that, but i might care a whole lot about damage to  to oklahoma's system of election. why do you allow party designations? i suppose it is because you want people to know that there are candidates who are associated with particular political views. and to allow a party to, in effect, come in and say, we don't have any particular political views, we  we just want to nominate, you know, whoever the most people want to nominate, that just destroys the whole purpose of  of your system of allowing people to run under a party label. what's the use of a party label?
not a value. i want to know what i'm distributing. and if you don't know i would say that this is, i have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.
well, that  this court 2 years ago in 2003 in the efabco case, the alabama supreme court had developed a practice of finding that lots of contracts didn't involve interstate commerce and interstate commerce didn't reach to a lot of things. and this court just 2 years ago said this is an issue for the court and there is interstate commerce here and they  they  and this court  i can't remember the phrase  per curiam. there was no need for an argument or whatever. the court just came in and resolved it 
that 
they did, justice ginsburg. they did in the last line of the statute.
you're on  you're on the court of appeals. they're proceeding for execution. the families of the victims know. the  the accused, the condemned man, is being  you tell your colleagues, let's just say nothing about this. you think that's good practice?
 principal and  corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and business agent. and i don't know of any rule to the effect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff simply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue the principal.
i understand that, and  but my  my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.
 prohibited by this statute. and when 
what about the other reasons underlying it, which is what i was trying to get at before? i see, literally, that the common law  you know, the enforcement rule, this is not literally enforcement. but what i was driving at with my questions is, even though literally it's not, the problems of complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we might think are basically unfair, that those considerations apply here, just as they do with the enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the federal government is really very much equivalent to enforcing the foreign rule in a court. i mean, that's the whole thing spelled out. and i meant it seriously, though i used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home. what is your response to that?
yes.
i can't quite tell. i think what the ninth circuit said was that because state law and federal law on this question was similar, at least in the ninth circuit's understanding, that the state court determination was an equivalent determination. once they made that finding, that there was an equivalent determination under state law, the ninth circuit decided that the claim must be precluded by issue preclusion.
yes, let me be clear on this, that if  if you just bring an action against the partnership qua partnership you could clearly do that because that's defined as a  as a legal entity 
thank you, mr. bailey. the case is submitted.
well, my guess is they 
well, justice scalia, i think the answer to that comes back to kimel and garrett. the excessive change in the constitutional law was held to have crossed the line in that case. and here, we have the same problems. we have the changing of the burdens. we have the changing of the level of scrutiny. and we have the efforts, the same efforts that were used in kimel and garrett 
what do you do with martin against ohio?
well, the  the responsibility that shrink imposes is to  to demonstrate both actual and perceived corruption at that the 
well, that is, that is exactly the scenario in the seventh circuit case that they cited in 2007. and they said it's, the child's estate is the one that brings the claim. now in that case, the child had actually expended the funds. but that case upheld the rule that we were advocating here.
your honor, i disagree that  that they made a big deal. they made a big deal of the kidnapping at the sentencing phase. that was  that was of significance. the  what the prosecutor did 
your honor, if this court had entered judgment for petitioners, which it could have, then you would be correct. but, instead, what this court did, as i said, is reverse and remand for consideration. and the seventh circuit 
 take a whole lot to figure out that you have a claim where your lawyer told you  you weren't going up for life and it turned out you were sent up for life.
and it's not what it does. it starts out saying that reasonable relationship is about the harm to jesse williams and then it says you may consider the harm suffered by others in determining that reasonable relationship. well, how does harm to others help you figure out what the relationship to jesse williams is? it doesn't compute.
well, i  i think explicit 
but that didn't go to whether it was a search or seizure. i think it goes to whether it was an unreasonable search or seizure. don't you think so? that what  what might be unreasonable with respect to a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a suitcase?
the second one would be the distinction between houses and cars and the protections that houses are given under the fourth amendment, which are far greater than the protections that people have in their cars.
 never been a case of a harassing search of a parolee.
sure, but take 
mere inducement only to the extent that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was  necessarily had to be required. let me give you an example.
well, i 
hearing on the motion to vacate and further appellate review. i don't think the due process clause requires the state to admit the ultimate truth of everything that mr. eastman testified to at that other trial. the question was did they have a good faith basis for putting him on, and they did. and did they have a good faith basis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said, that the conviction and the sentence in mr. stumpf's case were appropriate? and i believe the record supports that they did have a good faith basis for making that argument. if we look at the arguments they made, they were arguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in the record. you may believe it, you may not. either way, mr. stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence under ohio law and that sentence is appropriate. and the courts found, based on that argument, that mr. stumpf had appropriately been sentenced to death. this court has noted that the principal function of habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large risk that an innocent person will be convicted. well, we don't have that risk here. stumpf has knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that. and if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no risk that he received an impermissibly large sentence because the prosecutor made the evidence available, and stumpf's counsel used that evidence and argued it, and the court simply rejected it. if the court has no further questions, i'll stop. thank you.
your line would be something like if it  if  from all of the transcript, it appears that the judge is  is giving consideration to the entire case or something like that in a bench trial.
i see.
the  the joint venture was not declared invalid, justice. the joint venture was preserved. they were allowed to continue to keep the presses together, to keep the trucks together, to  to use the joint venture. as the court said below and as this court said, the  the pricing didn't depend  depend  i mean, the joint venture didn't dependent upon the pricing.
 "who lives here."
right.
that may or may not have been ineffective assistance of counsel. but i don't understand why  if a jurisdiction in this country has a procedural default rule that can be overcome by a showing of cause and prejudice with ineffective assistance of counsel being cause, why isn't that a remedy that is sufficient to give full effect to the treaty, which is what the treaty requires?
and  and is that like permitting discovery to go forward?
yes, it is, your honor. it's very odd.
it's actually a little bit  it's longer than 16 months, your honor. the district court referred to 16 months, but it's almost 2 and a half years, from february of 2000 to july of 2002, your honor.
your honor 
i'm talking about 502(e)(1).
well, isn't the 
well 
that's right.
i don't regard that as a reading in at all. i mean, capable means capable. you're either capable or not. if you practically can't be moved, your're not capable.
wouldn't they have come out the same way if they never mentioned the federal issue?
well, that isn't my question. i asked you whether any of them show that it was, in fact, a building or a car or a boat.
but in penry we didn't establish a per se rule. we said it depends upon the evidence. it depends upon the instructions. it depends upon what the prosecutors say. it seems to me that you're arguing for an absolute rule.
i might point out  i just looked at the question presented. it does assume  and i guess is drafted by the kansas attorney general. the question is what happens when mitigating and aggravating evidence is in equipoise. so the assumption on which we took the case is that there will be cases in which there's equipoise.
well, i  i don't know that i would because, again, you've got the  you've got the form that crawford was concerned about. the affidavit is the classic form.
no, but you're making a  if i understand what you're saying, you are making a kind of o'brien argument that the  that the burden on speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to something else. well, that  i think we have to draw this line between recruiting, on the one hand, which is what the military wants to do, and the solomon amendment, on the other hand. as i understand it, the solomon amendment is directed, or is responsive, entirely to positions taken by law schools on, among other things, first-amendment expressive grounds, so that if we are going to address the solomon amendment, i think we are addressing an exclusively first-amendment-speech expression issue.
then perhaps there should be a trial so it would all come out.
well, i think  i don't think there's other considerations other than, you know, this is penalty phase of a capital trial where we have to have the reliability of the fact-finding process. and the jurors are gauging the character of this defendant. and as you mentioned in your concurring opinion in riggins, the jury is searching to discover the heart and mind of this defendant, and considerations such as character or future dangerousness are very important and may, in fact, be determinative of what sentence the defendant receives. shackling a defendant basically places a thumb on death's side of the scale and dehumanizes the defendant, making it easier for the jury to find that he is worthy of a death sentence. the holbrook standard that this court established is a great standard. it has been in effect for  for decades and it works. it is efficient and it is just as easily applied in penalty phase. holbrook promotes the reliability of a death determination by limiting the risk that impermissible considerations will come into play. it also allows consideration of the individual circumstances of the case that is so crucial in the penalty phase. holbrook 
 and that there was a finding by the trial judge on it?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
thank you, mr. feldman. mr. kirkpatrick, you have 4 minutes remaining.
and that's why i would emphasize the trial court's findings in this case.
i'm uncertain. i  i think they did it in a generic fashion.
i  i think, though  i  i suppose that would depend on the nature of the specific evidence at issue. if you look at the evidence 
just as title vii says what can be brought is an action under this title or just as the environmental statute in steel company said what can be brought is an action under subsection (a). the cross reference of another provision containing substantive elements of federal law does not make those elements jurisdictional. that's the holding of arbaugh. that's the holding of steel company. there's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be applied when congress makes a federal defense removable as when it makes a federal claim subject to suit within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts.
yes.
well, it lists 
he put on  he  he had an 25 assistant district attorney take the stand and read the 1 transcript of the victim's testimony in the prior case, 2 which was included in that folder. he also used 3 information about when mr. rompilla incarcerated, paroled, 4 et cetera that was reflected by that folder. so plainly 5 these lawyers knew that that trial was going to be used 6 because the prosecutor told them. one other factor on  on the duty of the 8 counsel. these counsel testified that they knew that mr. 9 rompilla had problems in school and left school early. 10 the school administration building in allentown is across 11 the street from the capital case courthouse. ms. zapp 12 will confirm this. it says school administration 13 building. you walk by it when you go into this 14 courthouse. they knew he had problems in school. they 15 never walked in there and asked somebody, let me look at 16 the file.
well, if it's implausible, that might be a different consideration.
justice breyer, there is a big debate over whether or not there is too much patenting in this country and congress is involved in the debate. what i don't think that there is that much debate about is whether a properly applied test that the federal circuit has articulated strikes the right balance, because that is why all of the patent bar associations have filed on our side, i think, and that is it takes account of the interests of both sides and that is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned about overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have to be very concerned about hindsight determinations of obviousness. but i do want to just step back and make a point about judicial administration. if the ultimate conclusion of this court is that teaching, suggestion, motivation just boils down into an inquiry into obviousness, i still think that an opinion that says that and says that it, that this court believes that it is embracing the bottom line of what the federal circuit has been doing, is the one that will be much better for the patent system and for the courts, because we have a real concern and that was articulated  asked about at least by justice ginsburg and justice scalia, and that is if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if you say we're going off in a different direction, this test has  underlies 160,000 patents issued every year. there is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of validity if you're saying the patent examiner applied the wrong test. and it will create genuine dramatic instability. the question i think is if you think instead that the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is incomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of it, and that's really what i didn't understand from the first half-hour. if it's going to be 
well, sure, but the officer says, "all right. i'm taking you down to the station for a cavity search."
 may not be 
no. no, not the burden of  it's the entry.
yes, you are correct, your honor.
and that was correct under the law, wasn't it? in other words, "special circumstance" means the same thing when it's referred to  the term means the same thing when it's referred to in the statute on selection as it means in the statute on eligibility.
yes.
no, your honor, because we don't feel that there was probable cause for the arrest.
general clement, is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race? is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting to have racial mix?
you would be challenging the local action 
justice kennedy, that's not 
but i take it your answer was that all these were tried before texas amended the statute. was it 1991 when it amended the statute?
we rarely do that.
 in the course of those activities.
how did they find him?
we're together on this. (laughter.)
why wouldn't that same rule apply in a state where there's a common law cause of action for ejectment and it's substantively under state law different from a cloud on the title? you discuss in your brief, very helpfully i think, the  the hopkins and the taylor line of cases.
oh, my. you mean anything out there that  that a court could take judicial notice of can be  can be charged to the court? my goodness, no. i think it was the burden of the  of the defendant challenging the  the strikes to bring  bring that to the attention of the court. my goodness.
well, the  the thing is, i found stronger the other way, which you can answer, is that ordinarily, i guess, since they quote in one these amicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider  our state department  the treaties that have obligations are  also require appropriate enforcement remedies, et cetera. and we have avena and we have lagrand, and there the icj, as i read it, has said you have to have some kind of remedy, being pretty vague about what kind it is. all right. so normally we follow the icj, if we can. schooner betsy and go back forever. all right. so why not? just follow what they say, say there has to be some kind of remedy. and then we put our minds to figuring out what that kind is.
they are actually divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?
justice breyer, if one stipulates that that violates the wire fraud statute or that there's enough conduct that does, the question still comes down to whether the united states chooses to prosecute that case. this is not a 
well, justice breyer, i think that the facts of the case are subsumed within the description that you've given. the jury instructions did not require findings on all of those features; and that is, in large part, because of the kinds of instructions that arthur andersen 
no, justice scalia.
 it is, under other fields of the law, isn't it? i mean, i imagine that the very  we see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a state passes a law and the individual says, "well, i think this is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. so, my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it." there's no possibility in the world that he will violate that law. and yet, we've often held that, with regulations, you have to have the other requirements. you have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not just ideological, there's real harm. but, if those other requirements that are fulfilled, i've never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment. i've just never found that phrase, and i can't imagine why it would be part of the law.
i don't think that that issue has been presented and decided by the california supreme court specifically 
i think i would still make the same argument. i just think the argument has extraordinary force when the  when the petitioner has an obligation to provide us with notice because, again, it goes  you know, why is this reasonably calculated? it's  it's in the context of a scheme that says you will provide us specific information and we will rely upon that as the mechanism by which we inform you of your obligations to us and that under those circumstances and only those circumstances, do you forfeit your property rights.
yes, but there are also  it's a  again, it's a discretionary determination, and there are prejudice issues that should be considered as the 
it sounds like you are in that it's a tougher standard than normal. here you had a situation, did you not, where there were three black prospective jurors and the prosecutor struck all three?
well, just as long as you have a minute  (laughter.)
and the same would be true if you were dealing with a state bank incorporated in north carolina with its principal place of business in virginia that had 50 branches in south carolina. the same thing 
so did the super  sorry.
it's invalid as a matter of state law.
that's true.
no. what i'm saying, your honor, is that if you're arrested, the next  you have a choice, and you have one of three if you are a national, but if you're a foreigner, you have one of four. and the question 
that's really the critical 
and the  the payment here  it says  the statute uses the word payment. so suppose you simply have an ira plan but you don't take money out of it. then is it exempt from bankruptcy?
so it's identical. there is no difference between every individual's contract, every federal employee's  i guess it's a contract with the federal employee. isn't it? i mean, he's bound by it you say.
mr. hurd, you have about three minutes left.
thank you.
well, i don't think so, your honor. i think every single contract case in the lower courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute about the interpretation of the terms. here, what they're trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of the contract. they're trying to adjudicate an infringement action and then say, "aha, see what i have? i have a judgment that the patent's invalid. and so, now i'd like to say that i don't have to pay royalties under my contract."
i  i agree with you that that is how the seventh circuit described the opinion and what  what the adjudicatory authority was, and that is why we take issue with the seventh circuit. we do think that the state court on remand has any issue that the defendants want to raise before it. all that the federal district court has done is to decide that  that there was no basis for a slusa preemption because the requisites of subsection (b) had been satisfied. but i want to point out that the issue before you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is appealable. and what is important in the error of the seventh circuit was that they held that that decision was appealable, and under the thermtron rule, as applied in gravitt and things remembered, even a district court decision that is erroneous in its construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction and therefore falls within the four corners 
 as well.
well, that means 
correct, your honor.
driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved. scott could have been killed, couldn't he?
yes. correct. remember 
but wasn't the 
i disagree that that is a necessary reading 
i'm not adding it. there's a residual category at the end: or any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. i consider this  you consider it a significant change in working conditions.
i mean, why are we going through this  this proceeding here?
 even here 
well, it came  it may have violated the sixth amendment. i don't know that i would concede that. but to avoid any constitutional issue, if we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district court didn't comply with the statute.
 putting something into the water.
that is certainly true. fewer appeals, at any rate. and as long as we're talking about litigation expense, i think, to bring us back to one of petitioner's arguments, they contend that their standard would reduce the amount of costs invested in jurisdictional issues. but, in the same breath, they also say that the standard that they propose would encourage plaintiffs to move for remand. the two cannot coexist. if  not every remand motion is meritorious. so, by encouraging plaintiffs to move for remands, you're, in fact, increasing the amount of jurisdictional litigation and the amount of costs incurred at  over jurisdictional issues. i wanted, if i could, to answer one question that justice ginsburg asked in the beginning about the omnibus act. justice ginsburg mentioned that it contained removal-friendly provisions. and it does. they're not only the two that were mentioned  lack of  or abolition of the verification doctrine and deletion of the removal bond  but much more significant expansions of removal jurisdiction. the  for us from california, in particular, the 1988 act said that you could disregard the citizenship of "doe," or fictitiously named, defendants in deciding whether there was diversity  complete diversity in a case. that was huge for us in california, because virtually every state court complaint in california contains "doe" defendants. and prior to that amendment, their citizen  you had to guess at their citizenship, and it prevented removal of virtually all state court complaints, on diversity grounds. so, to say that this 1988 act was designed to discourage removals plainly goes against the text of the act. furthermore, removal furthers not only the private interest of the defendant, but the government's interest, the federal interest, the interest of the people of the united states, in many cases. and that's precisely why congress has given us the right to remove in a whole series of areas, not only in diversity, but, of course, in federal question. an interesting example, because it arose for the first time in 1875, in the same act of march 3, 1875, from which this cost provision comes, an act that was passed by the lame-duck radical republicans at the same time they passed the civil rights act of 1875, for the purpose of allowing federal courts to enforce the new federal rights that congress felt were not being adequately addressed in state courts. so, the state courts, particularly the south, were thought to be hostile to the new federal rights. similarly, just this year, in the class action fairness act, congress allowed defendants to remove multi-state class actions, not for the benefit of the defendants, but for the benefit of the entire nation. it  the senate report, at page 9, specifically points out that it is those cases which most affect the interstate commerce of this nation, and, for that reason, they belong in federal court. now, why would congress choose to discourage defendants from removing those very cases by adopting a plaintiff-friendly 
i didn't think boyle went that far.
because they interpreted the statute in a particular way. isn't that right? i'm asking. i'm not 
so you're saying that the original source of the information was published?
but the argument that i think people are worried about, against you, is, you have a case  it's actually a wonderful example. your client thinks that, in the affidavit that the sheriffs gave supporting the warrant, they didn't tell the truth, because they said that whoever was looking into it, you know, said there was a private driveway and that there were tire tracks, and there were no tire tracks, and it wasn't a private driveway. the other side says, "yes, it was a long road, but sort of like a driveway, and the edge of the  of the driveway was broken down, and that's what the sheriff's deputies were referring to." i found it a dispute on both sides.
that's certainly true, your honor. and yet i think if you look both at your opinion in glucksberg and in the opinion  excuse me  and in the text of the controlled substances act, you will find that this court has recognized that this specific subject, physician-assisted dying, is one that is for the states to regulate.
well 
and if he chooses to attack only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other issue. and when he comes in later and tries to raise the issue that he could have attacked under the '92 judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas, it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do it.
may i ask you one final question? as a matter of due process, why shouldn't the state  after learning of the supposed admission in wesley, after taking wesley's position, why shouldn't the state, when it gets back to the stumpf case before the remaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut bait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman and we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think he was the triggerman because we've taken this other position? why can the state, as a matter of due process, stand there agnostic?
yes.
i think that that type of situation is just so highly unlikely. it doesn't really comport with the realities of what whistleblowers are thinking about. for instance, in this case, ms. wilson didn't come forward until she saw no one else would come forward and remedy what she saw as theft from the u.s. government.
well, but i'm not  i'm not sure that you don't have a further answer to justice stevens because there's (3)(a) and (3)(b). (3)(a) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the prevailing party. (3)(b) says, for the same sample the number of hours spent.
there, there's not a specific colloquy that goes through 
i  i thought the  the specific intent element would be satisfied if  if they, by plan, went to the scene with  with deadly weapons.
and that seems to me where i have trouble with your argument.
i just want to be sure your position. assume that there is a remand that was improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and the powerex argues all along, i was entitled to a federal forum and a non-jury trial. and the state court says no all the way up. can they file a petition for certiorari saying, we had a federal right that was denied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench trial? can they petition for certiorari at the end of the state proceeding in your view.
that's absolutely right, your honor. there's no limit on where the taxpayer purchases the equipment they install in the state. there's no limit  no effect on where the goods from the factory go. there's no limit on who you can hire to work in the factory, or where they come from.
i'm not aware of any reason to believe that, your honor, based on the historical record and based on the modern realities. the wal-marts of the world have succeeded because of their discounting strategy. that's not going to change, and manufacturers have an incentive to have their goods sold through those stores and that's not going to change either in the vast majority of cases. and with respect 
at the time 
well, you  you equate this to a case where the defendant is just accidentally not present. that's  that's what i got. i  i had the same problem with your opening two sentences as justice ginsburg did. you said if the defendant is absent from the courtroom. well, in this case, he was absent because he chose to be absent. you're  you're equating this case to one in which it was as if for some reason they forgot to have him in the courtroom.
it's certainly not improper to make statements based on inferences from the evidence.
 only 
well, i don't agree, with respect, your honor. with respect to mere offers, offering a price to different purchasers is not covered by the statutory language. with respect to the sales-to-sales comparisons, there is not the requisite effect of such discrimination 
final. final action or failure to act is what 
there are two subdivisions: subdivision (a) and subdivision (b). subdivision (a) says attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses  expenses, and in subdivision (b), it refers to consultants. but there isn't any 
 and a much harder 
he did, but he was also pointing out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in crane that the liability arose in crane out of  i forget the full name of it  the appliance act. and the appliance act had its own set of standards. and therefore, you cannot, from an appliance act case, you cannot infer anything one way or the other about the general standard in fela. and to make it even more official complicated, as i recall, rogers was an appliance case, too, but he didn't get into that there. but my only point is, you are right about the two brennan opinions, rogers and the  crane. but given the fact that it was an appliance case, i don't think you can infer one thing or another about an ultimate fela standard in the absence of an appliance action. what remains is that the citation in rogers was to coray, and coray spoke about there still being proximate cause.
the statute is plain, your honor.
yes, your honor, i will turn to 24 that. i will to turn to that with more sentence on the 25 ineffective issue, and that sentence is that the 1 respondent's argument in this case misstates, with all due 2 respect to  to my friend, ms. zapp  misstates the 3 holding of wiggins. the respondent reads wiggins as 4 holding only that when counsel has a lead, counsel should 5 pursue a thorough life history investigation. i  i think it's pretty clear these lawyers 7 here had leads, but even if they didn't, the holding of 8 simmons  the first holding of simmons is that counsel 9 has a duty to conduct a thorough life history mitigation 10 investigation and cannot rely on rudimentary knowledge 11 from a narrow set of sources. these counsel had less of a 12 rudimentary knowledge than the counsel in simmons because 13 they relied upon 
yes, it was justified. at that time what they heard from the curb side and then from the front was the same kind of violence going on. they heard that from  from the time they arrived all the way. they  they heard the thumping, the shouting, someone saying, get off me, stop, stop. and so what these officers were doing, in the course of that, is investigating that  that, and it led them to the backyard. now 
but that was 
as i remember the text of section 3, it applies to other products patented or unpatented.
yes.
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to interrupt.
 if they break the law, you can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't effectively do that if the warehouse is in california. isn't that your point?
but the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer. and that in some cases depends solely on skin color. you know, it's like saying everybody can have a meal but only people with separate skin can get the dessert.
but it 
whether it's unique?
they're different but not necessarily of different  entitled to different respect from the courts. a defined  what is it, define and delimit? these are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the  this rule won't apply to companies over this  that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. so congress says we're going to give the agency that authority. in addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret  interpret the language of the statute.
because  because we  first of all, we leave it there for 37 cents, and we leave it in a volume  660 million pieces of  a day. fedex and ups aren't even in the neighborhood 
that's right. and they  they did  they did modify the form. so on the question of the underlying constitutionality, i want to  i want to make a few points, that the  the threshold question really is whether there's an appeal as of right in michigan for a plea-based conviction. michigan law is clear that there is no appeal by right. it's an application process and it's a discretionary review. the michigan court of appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these cases, has no obligation to review the merits.
yes, but among the evidence they did have were the two  two teenagers are drinking beer in the backyard. so they pretty clearly had the alcohol  they could have gotten that in evidence.
no, but the method may simply be lethal injection. and, going back to justice o'connor's question, it might still be the case that, on the theory the government is advancing this morning, it would be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because that was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice of medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance for something outside the practice of medicine, and hence, it would be illegal.
and 
justice souter, you do. that  that is our  our point, but i would like to qualify that slightly. in  if the search does not, with reasonably diligent efforts, turn up a better address or if there's a better address and the letter comes back, i think at that point it's perfectly reasonable to stop searching for an address, to give up on mailed notice, and at that point post the property because getting 
well, and i think that this statute, reasonably read, your honor, tells you exactly what that specific thing is. if you intimidate them, if you mislead them, if you use physical force, if you corruptly persuade them. and that means either you've used unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to violate their independent legal duties. and that definition, your honor, is quite consistent with the traditional interpretation of the term "corruptly," even in the obstruction statutes. and i'd like to just emphasize, for instance, in a tampering case, a juror tampering case that preceded the congressional adoption of the term "corruptly persuades," the jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed that "corruptly" means "knowingly and willfully, with the specific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties as a petit juror." similarly, in aguilar, in the district court, the jury was instructed  that was a tampering case  quote, "an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily and intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or a lawful result by some unlawful method," end quote. this is exactly parallel to the interpretation that andersen is asking this court to adopt. and if that if that interpretation is adopted, it makes sense of this statute. if this statute isn't read in reference to the violation of other legal duties, than it covers a whole range of conduct that is unquestionably innocent 
let's  let's not overread crawford. crawford didn't say that the only thing the confrontation clause was directed at was the kind of abuse that  that occurred in the case of sir walter raleigh. it said that that was the principal abuse at which it was directed. i doubt very much, unless you think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the affidavit, and gave it to the police, i doubt whether that would have been allowed under the confrontation clause. do you think it would have?
in my particular case? this 
then they shouldn't have voted for the severability provision which clearly says if, in one of its applications, it's invalid, the rest can be given effect without the invalid provisions. i mean, the severability provision really just flatly contradicts your assertion that the new hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to happen.
how old was brewer at that time?
so  when  when you  when you fold that into the circumstances, it doesn't seem to me an overwhelming case for equitable tolling.
would that do the job?
in mr. brown's case in north carolina, my understanding was  is that the state had went and purchased a device to make sure that he was actually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't subject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed within  within the briefs. that actually was challenged because mr. brown's attorneys didn't think that the  the people that were monitoring the machine were properly trained. the court ruled against them, and as we know, mr. brown was  was executed. it didn't result in the series of challenges as  as many are obviously concerned about.
 from the evidence?
what  what percentage of the  of the territory of the united states do you believe is  is subjected to permits from the corps of engineers on your theory whenever you want to move dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand? what  what percentage of the total land mass of the united states, if you define tributary as broadly as you define it to include? every storm drain? i mean, it's the whole country, isn't it?
you say the way to think about that 
yes.
it's not in the screening. it doesn't say you screen out for failure to exhaust.
thank you, mr. goldstein. mr. hungar, you have four minutes left.
thank you, mr. shapiro. the case is submitted.
on step one, i take it it's not enough to simply say, look, the person challenged is a member of a minority group. what more must be shown?
the  the second circuit seemed to rely on an earlier case that is much featured in respondent's brief, but i don't recall your dealing with it. is that commercial cleaning case of the knowingly hiring undocumented aliens and paying them less than the minimum wage, which gave that person a competitive edge over rivals who  who paid what the law required?
that's not to say that the public employer is free from being challenged with regards to the employment decision. it may be a matter for the employee to seek, through the grievance procedure, that  like mr. ceballos did initially, or even pursue it to civil service remedies. and those are the type of decisions that the personnel in those departments are more ably, i think, to decide.
okay, fine.
what if the  what if the inmate said, look, the  the lawyers who come to see us are  are great guys, but they're  they're overworked. they don't have time to be thinking about novel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps if we could get to legal times and these periodicals? so it's  it's not an alternative.
and i think it is conceivable that the florida court was correct that you could draw the line some way and say contracts that are void should be handled differently.
right.
yes, and certainly where officers have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault, officers can enter. now, one of the problems with the utah supreme court's holding in this case 
it doesn't say that. it says "about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed." i live in san francisco. my mother lives in massachusetts. now, if i hire a companion to live in massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed. so if we're being literal and if you win this case, i don't see how  and i'm worried about this, obviously  however  and i think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. and if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions. now, if i were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, i would be telling the truth. it is a very worrisome point.
no.
is  is there an argument to be made that the reason we make that emphasis and  and an argument for you in this case that there is somehow a greater fragility to  to the effective standards to prevent racial classification than there is to the possibility of enforcing speech rights and so on? is there something to worry about here more than in the case of  of enumerated rights that  that gets the turner analysis?
that's 
uh-huh.
the natural and probable consequences theory cuts across a wide variety of crimes, as the government points out. so it would also cover the different provisions under the ina such as burglary, theft, and other provisions as well. the government, though, is incorrect in stating that the natural and probable consequences is a majority view. even in its brief, the government only sets forth 22 states that it says apply that analysis. those 22 states that the government cites, many of them do not support the proposition that it is a majority view or even applied in those states. for example, just to give a couple of examples, the government cites missouri as a state that applies the natural and probable consequences doctrine. however in missouri, in the very case cited by the government, people v. evans, the court rejects the use of the natural and probable consequences doctrine and says, "the use of the natural and probable consequences doctrine was error as a matter of law." the same is true  and that's on the same page the government cites. the same is true with respect to maryland, where the same footnote that the government cites rejects the natural and probable consequences doctrine in favor of a narrower theory. it's also true in idaho, louisiana, georgia and texas, also do not apply the natural and probable consequences doctrine. so what, the government here is seeking to hold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated felony without the requisite mens rea, and something that's a minority view of the states. just to put this into context, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if california passed a statute saying that in some cases someone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea of burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft without the mens rea of theft.
one of 
yes, but doesn't that simply  isn't the analogy there that when a  when a search warrant says you may  you may pick up implements of drug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic. it doesn't cover coffee, tea, and  and milk. in  in the case of the electronic surveillance, they're supposed to record criminal conversations and  but not others.
and therefore, if we accept your interpretation, then all those employers who, instead of contributing directly to health funds, instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, will discover they do not have the advantage of the fifth priority.
they press a button and they have an electronic transmission that sends a stream of protons under the atlantic ocean and are changed into electrical impulses that are used to inscribe the precise code onto a hard drive in the form of electromagnetic pulses.
and the other one being that  the attack on the problem is there happens to be instances where tying is justified for procompetitive reasons, risk-sharing, maintaining product quality, probably jerrold electronics. there are a number of them. and the real problem is that the law hasn't admitted a defense. but where the attack should be is on the tied product, not the tying product. what do you think of that?
that's right. and i would say that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that conclusion.
you've mentioned  you've mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before the tribunal. what are the other rights recognized by all civilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee?
you don't find the overt act explicitly in the statute.
well, is that  i mean, your friend on the other side says that the cause of action would have accrued at the moment at which he was bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate. at that point the false arrest and the incarceration incident to the false arrest is over and if there is ever going to be a claim for what happens next, i gather it'ss going to be a common law action for false imprisonment, and that, i guess, would not accrue until the imprisonment is over. but so far as the arrest is concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong is completed at the point at which an independent magistrate takes over.
i don't  i don't think it's like violating the contract here, though, your honor, because, what are the consequences here? what is the choice? first of all, they actually owe the royalties under the agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not enforce it. that's number one. so, they're not forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply trying to get out of the contract. number two, the consequences here, the choice they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion. again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted. all they're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if they stop paying royalties  yes, they may well be sued for infringement  but, if they do, all they face is the loss of their discount.
i 
yes.
it's  it's a little odd that 
 position is 
so 
well, with respect, justice kennedy, this isn't a "group of people." this is the president invoking an authority that he's exercised in virtually every war that we've had. it's something that was recognized in the civil war, something in the world war ii that this court approved.
don't remember.
those are  those are regulatory provisions, right?
your honor, it involves a small number of inmates, and those inmates have been determined through a very predictive determination that  that in fact they do pose a threat 
but i guess what he's saying  i'm trying to put the  as good a light on it as i can  it's a  that if, in fact  if a big real-estate developer, which is a corporation  what they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and their deals would take the form of hundreds and hundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned buildings in various states. and i think he's saying, "well, for diversity purposes, we should consider the citizenship of the parent corporation to be the citizenship of the limited partnership that happens to have control of the building that we're complaining about."
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
but further to justice scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?
 what you call discrimination is any differential. in fact, in this case, the effective tax differential is a quid pro quo for an investment. and, basically, your argument boils down to saying that there's discrimination whenever the state offers a quid pro quo for an advantage and somebody decides not to take advantage of it.
no 
it depends. they couldn't get that?
there's  there's no trial.
that's correct. it would say, "denied, in re swain," meaning denied for being untimely. as opposed, justice scalia, to the 1,223 cases that were unexplained.
that's a very strange reading of the rule.
i think that  i think there's a split in the lower courts about how the mitigation will apply.
no. it  it's one hypothesis. there is no answer filed by the state as to what the real reason was. what happens?
suppose they  i  that's why i want to know 
well, with respect, justice scalia, i would say it is the sort of reliance that a  that a defendant may have, as for example the case in sanabria, where a  where a judge excludes certain evidence, and the case goes forward. and as a result of that  a result of that decision, the judge in that case granted a motion for acquittal. and at the end of the case, the prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically said if i had let it back in, i would have vacated my motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to the jury. so that sort of prejudice  a defendant has an expectation of certain things that may or may not happen at trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy context, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial. the drastic remedy of double jeopardy is  is used when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial before a second trier of fact. this  this court has been consistent that when the government subjects the defendant over and over again before a second 
yes.
if they  if they never told us, i guess we would be in  in a position of  of assuming sims is in place. but the thing is, is that it's an equitable  it's an equitable argument. and florida is not coming forward with clean hands. they created this and then they just want to say, well, you should have known. we're not going to do anything to help you. we're going to shroud this in secrecy and not tell anybody.
yes, sir.
thank you, ms. underwood. mr. olson, you have 3 minutes remaining.
of course, also bearing upon our prudential judgment, i  i suppose, would be that in order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert to be an end run around the younger abstention. and 
yes. our position relies only on the statute. we embrace the text of the statute. (f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be reasonable. we agree with that. the point i would then take you to is that in  if the court were interested in the regulation  we don't think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it were, the eeoc has said that it too recognizes that the phrase, business necessity, in the context of the age act does not mean essential to the business. let me tell you why it used the language it did, business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up. and that is when this court first used the words, business necessity, in griggs and then subsequently in wards cove, it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as being quite a high employer burden. if i could just read to you two things from griggs. griggs said, the touchstone is business necessity. if the employment practice cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited. it simply required related to job performance. that's the backdrop on which the eeoc used the word.
what has  what has been proposed by the  by the respondents in this case, of course, is to make it voluntary, so that people 
yes, but that 
you've got to have both.
 pay for what 
i believe that it is both. i think that the assignment provisions limit the permissible assignment as a matter of federal law by reason of the anti-lien statute.
i  i thought she and the 
how is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left rockwell? i mean, all of this failure occurred after he was gone.
but you do take a field preemption position, don't you?
it would be constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice because they could not ascertain a better address.
i'm sorry? what would be given prospective effect?
 in the 
you don't doubt that a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified as an arm of the state in a particular instance.
thank you, ms. neaves.
that  that is a certainly a challenge.
 you  you paint it as though the  you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. the  the government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats. that may well be, but there  there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.
 may it please the court: i'd like an opportunity to respond to several of the points that were made by my colleague. first, i find it interesting that and also of some relevance in this case that the decision to deny access to secular newspapers and magazines that this policy of withdrawing access to these materials is not a policy of the federal bureau of prison with respect to its most maximum security inmates, those who are housed in the control units. i also think it's important to note that while there's a 90-day minimum period that these inmates have to remain in the long term segregation unit on level 2 status where this  when this policy applies, the policy also says that as long as an inmate is serving a disciplinary sentence within the prison, that he's not eligible for promotion to level 1. and the testimony from the department's designated witness, deputy  superintendent dickson, acknowledged that most of the inmates in the unit are, indeed, serving disciplinary time.
and  and by the coast guard.
maybe you can think 
yes, but all the  all the statute does is abrogate.
how?
there was no discharge of anything. it was clear that if there was a  if there was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.
but if i just  do you think it's conceivable that we just didn't realize those four points were at issue?
they are saying that visitorial powers over the state-chartered operating subs is exclusively 
oh, there are many dismissed, for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite  there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it. i'm just wondering if there is an additional reason that there has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment action. it's that phrase that i've never found anywhere 
well, i am not aware of any instance in which legislative facts, as you will call them, that is, facts that go to where a line should be drawn, whether it's by this court because the constitution ought to be so interpreted or a legislation should change, would be properly introduced to a jury that is supposed to accept the law, that has required to accept the law as is given by a judge 
it's certainly the case, justice scalia, that the presumptions the ninth circuit adopted could permit cases that even the california state courts would consider to be untimely 
yes, your honor.
do i correctly understand your argument to be that, that in this case it happened to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same argument if it were a doubt about subject matter jurisdiction?
well  i'm not an expert on  on that industry.
of course, one of the interesting aspects of this kind of discrimination is the victim of the discrimination is the more powerful buyer in these cases.
 court-created defenses. and as this court is well aware, this court nor any other court has the power to define subject matter jurisdiction. that is congress' purview and power. only congress can limit the court's jurisdiction and define the court's jurisdiction for the lower federal courts. here, congress has spoken with respect to small businesses. it's a different matter, i would suggest, with respect to prosecutors, which is an immunity that is  is a product of common law and  and a judicial creation. i would also want to point out that  another thing. the solicitor general indicated that if you look at the structure of the  the liability section, he implied that it just imposes the employer definition into the  all the other causes of action. in fact, it does not. it says, it  it shall be unlawful for an employer to, and then it defines what is unlawful. so i think there again it's indicating a difference between other elements of the cause of action and the employer relationship and the employer existence under title vii. ultimately, what this boils down to is whether or not small businesses are going to continue to receive the protection that congress has indicated that it wanted them to have.
that's bizarre.
no, your honor, because of the importance of the word "plan." and this goes to my answer to justice scalia earlier. the fact that it has to be a plan to obstruct or affect interstate commerce is an important limitation here. and it's key to remember that this is the position that the united states government took for at least 25 years  from the franks case, in 1974, to the milton case, in the fourth circuit in 1998, the yankowski case, in 1999  and it hasn't had those effects. but if it does, your honor, then the appropriate solution is for congress to change the statute, but not for this court to ignore the plain meaning of the law. the final issue that was presented concerns the rico statute. here, section 1964(a) clearly authorizes courts to have jurisdiction to issue injunctions. unlike the sherman act provision that only authorized the government to seek injunctive relief, section 1964(a) allows federal courts of jurisdiction, in any instance. this court has said, in many instances, as chief justice roberts pointed out, such as franklin versus gwinnett county, that when federal courts have jurisdiction, they retain equitable power unless congress expressly stripped that authority. so 
i  i don't think i could say that at this point because 
well, a nice question. i mean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse. just have some new company carry your water for you.
no, but the  the difficulty that i have with that argument is take the  take the case of  of the arrestable offense in which it is undoubtedly the case that although the police don't normally arrest, they  they can. your  if i understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact, do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and indeed, i presume you would agree, they could make an inventory search because they've got to protect themselves against claims that they lost property and so on. so there's no question that in that case, as  as you have argued it, they could make a full-blown search and  and certainly can use the dog. but if they choose not to arrest on the highway, they can't. my problem is how can you say that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if you admit that the police can search in case number one. how does that affect the reasonable expectation of privacy?
 the whole right to  to go into court with a constitutional claim is absent from the statute. and  and so we may as well get hung for a sheep as a lamb. if  if we're going to recognize the one, i don't see that we're going too much further in  in saying it's got to be conditional on the other.
but do you agree with mr. kise that the first dismissal in the florida court, the first denial was on the florida 2-year statute of limitations?
the question 
does  look, does the  does the person in charge of the dredge control this process of pulling against anchor lines that moves it 8 feet or whatever it is?
in the penalty phase.
yes, your honor, he would have to get a warrant. and  and the requirement 
not your fault.
counsel 
yes.
yes, it's a mixed question. but if the post-conviction relief court found as a matter of fact that even had he known about the possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he would have persisted in refusing to cooperate  if there was such a finding, and know you dispute it  and if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?
no, there's not, your honor. what we have 
no, it wasn't. and it's not part of this lawsuit, because there's no dispute that the communication at issue in this case is that disposition memorandum that he prepared purely pursuant to his prosecutorial duties.
but he did take the position that there was no need for shackles at all.
well, we don't  i hope we don't have to, at this court, look at all the evidence and try to sort it out that way. what we have to focus on is whether the court of appeals for the federal circuit was in error in articulating the scope of the exemption.
yes.
that's 
well, why is that? why? why? i mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the teacher says on the school trip, i don't want people unfurling 15 foot banners. i don't care what they are about.
so  so you're saying if in fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a way we handle retired foreign spies, smiley for example, or someone like that. it has nothing to do with it, you see. then could they  what would be the rules then?
well, what were those? i see that sentence. the jury 
they should have made the probable cause determination.
it was a lien case, and of course, 7426 involves a levy. but nonetheless, the holding that i have read in that case very definitively deals with the breadth of section 1346. and the breadth of section 1346, according to the holding and united states vs. williams, is certainly broad enough to encompass a third party like petitioner. i do not view the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would permit a third party to bring a refund action. and that was the holding of the court as i read that opinion.
thank you, mr. kester. ms. maynard.
but if you do the same combination over telephone lines, you say they are  they are selling 
no. official
i'm not  i'm not aware  i'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that. but in response to your proposal, the  the  what  what's wrong with that is that it would allow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into the subjective motivations of persons involved in the decision-making process with no mechanism analogous to immunity or the  or the probable cause criterion to weed out 
let me understand your answer to justice stevens' question. if epa made the judgment under the statute, you think they would have had the authority?
well, it wouldn't be a new one. it would be just following the old ibm case and all those cases.
well, but the prior paragraph says it's because of the history of his biological grandfather, biological brother, and biological child. that suggests to me it's a genetic claim and 
it's just for local protectionism. we want to promote our wines, and not anybody else's.
well, it said attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.
well, i think we have  justice breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the way they would in the guilt phase. so in this very case, if you look at the joint appendix, when  when on the eve of trial ms. mccottry is no longer going to show up for trial, the prosecutor says, i want to subpoena the jail records and i want to talk to the victim's advocate to find out whether she's been intimidated or kept away. so the prosecutor herself tells the court how she's going to look for this evidence. if she had found anything, presumably she would have presented it and she could have presented it that way. and it's 
yes. what did they hold in the tenth circuit? i mean, shall could be mandatory. you can have a mandatory duty, but that doesn't mean that the victim has a legal right to enforce that duty.
it says where you think there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference, death.
oh, but it  but there is no liability if the order fails to issue. the order, if it were the first salvo, you still would be required to official respond. and so, your failure to respond is very much a default. the failure to respond to the letter, the audit letter, has no legal operative effect 
yes.
but 
 a right to oppose the school board's choice, and if what you say about making it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get your fees.
well, justice stevens, our position is more complicated than that, because within a guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the government 
if i can adopt justice breyer's language from o'neal and say that this court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion. we accept o'neal's holding what then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in this case, the tie goes to 
or it might be tolled, your honor. and there are also four different trigger dates in the statute for when it can first apply, that you aren't going to be able to tell, necessarily, three of them from the face of the petition.
but something around 275?
yes, i can. i'll give you two sets of examples. the first is the examples identified by the solicitor general in his cert petition defending the eeoc's position in the francis w. parker case in 1994. the eeoc pursued cases  and they're cited in the cert petition  involving rules that prohibit  that require recent college graduates to get a job that forbid hiring someone who worked previously for a higher salary than they would be getting in the new  in the new job and that laid off people who would be eligible to retire soon. so those are the examples the solicitor general gave. i'll give you two other examples. one is a  a case called 
if there were live fish 
that is so. this court 
it seems to me, justice scalia, that it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases where there is  someone pleads guilty in and preserving a right to appeal a certain issue. i don't have a case to cite to you but it strikes me as quite understandable that the parties might agree if the outcome of the legal question that the judge might decide is going to be x, then the consequence will be a liability for y. if it's  if it's of the opposite outcome, the outcome will be different. that's 
i think the concession is important to get beyond the statements in isolation, because 
yes.
when he's in prison, is there any problem about the prison guards intruding upon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?
but that apparently, if i understand your answer, is what the result would be. and is there  and i don't want to, you know, make it hard for you. i think you're having a hard time finding a justification for that result and i certainly can't find one. can you think of any?
that's the case 
only one mistake.
what if congress wanted to leave it to the state to waive the statute of limitations provision? how could it have made that clear? i mean, i would have thought that if they made it a statute of limitations provision instead of a jurisdictional provision  i mean, they could have said, you know, "no jurisdiction if it's filed beyond a certain date, and we mean it." but it put it as a statute of limitation, which normally is waivable. and i would think that that is an indication that congress thought, "really, if the state thinks that in this particular case we shouldn't hew to the technicality of the statute of limitation, the state ought to be able to waive it.
i'm sure it's not his theory. he  he thinks it's  it's attached to transactions, and  and much of his argument is devoted to showing that capital transactions are no different from other transactions as far as the internal revenue code's desire to match the  the gain with the expenses concerned. and that's the part of his theory that i'm not so sure about because aside from the  aside from the condemnation case that i mentioned, i  i don't know of any other cases in which the internal revenue service has treated transaction costs the way he would have it done. maybe it makes sense, but i 
 a prejudgment 
yes, but 
that is correct.
there  thank you, justice breyer. there are several considerations and steps that must be approached and proven by the state before we get to that actual equation. first of all, the state follows the guided discretion standard of this court, as laid out in furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of what capital murder is. in fact, the kansas death penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the nation. and then past that point to the sentencing jury, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist with jury unanimity. and then past that point, kansas has complied with this court's requirement under the eighth amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other than death and that instruction is specifically pointed out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28. furthermore, the jurors are 
he was pulled over for speeding at 71 miles an hour in a 65 miles an hour zone on i-80. right?
is that what we would say about all these gambling casino boats that are parked on the side of the mississippi river?
it's a case about money. your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.
well 
it looks like it was the middle of the week. so maybe there were one or two weekends. so maybe what the judge's mistake was, he didn't know how to count the weekend rule.
yes.
well, perhaps because you can refer to the police report.
saying, "it is of utmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning salmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we find objectionable, so we're going to go a different direction, as a matter of power policy for the state of whatever, and not allow hydroelectric power."
because?
three more months for the defense to 
i would  i read the statute this way. congress takes the world as it comes. if you are providing it as a common carrier, then you fall within  you're providing it separately  then you fall within the definition of "telecommunications service." the dsl guys are. if you are not, and we are not, then you don't fall within 
supposing  i've written a fair number of opinions involving criminal cases where i've had to say that we take all the inferences favorable to the prosecution, and based on that rule, we find there's sufficient evidence to justify the jury's verdict. how we would have decided it is not before us. we accept the jury's verdict. what if the  on the merits of the underlying crimes, the south carolina supreme court had written that kind of an opinion rather than there's overwhelming evidence of guilt? do you think they would have held the third party evidence admissible or inadmissible?
that's right. exactly right, your honor.
 kaul case? i read  i don't think the kansas supreme court could have been any more clear. it said the legislature amended the legislation to clarify where the incidence of taxation falls. it provided that the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. then, in victa, in connection with the standing issue, because economic burden fell on the retailers, it found that the retailers and  those other retailers had standing. kansas could not have been more clear. in section 3401(f)(3), it defines a "distributor" as someone who receives the product. in 3408(c), it's  taxes the distributor on the first receipt of the tax. in 3410, it again says it's on the distributor. two district courts and two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. the kansas supreme court said the same thing, the distributor is liable for the tax, pays the tax. the retailer has no liability for the tax. what in the world can kansas do to make it clearer? now, the central machinery case that's  that my opponents have been speaking about is a case that was decided under the indian trader statutes with respect to the trading with the indians, with respect to central machinery case, was  over tractors sold on the reservation for use on the reservation. it fell within the scope of the indian trader statute. but this court has made clear, in a number of cases, the indian trader statutes would not remotely apply.
and is  was that improper to take into account? how would a reasonable person in this situation feel?" would he feel that he was impelled to speak, because the co-perpetrator had 
it 
exactly, and 
are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?
but in what sense is it an application for state post-conviction review when it's pending before us? we are considering a claim that the state erroneously decided a federal question 
in one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.
first of all, there's nothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutor had appeared many times before this trial judge. another point is 
the contribution limits  amounts over the contribution limits for 
thank you, counsel. mr. dreeben.
so you think there would be recovery in that scenario.
 i understand that.
but you know, i would tell my ceo ignore that, that it's meaningless.
but there's 
well, justice scalia, we agree, in the sense that we think that the statute establishes at least a default rule. and, just to be clear, if the court holds that federal law establishes the traditional rule, then, obviously, we would be very happy with that decision. what we  what we reject to strenuously is petitioner's position that federal law imposes an unstated burden on the school districts in all proceedings initiated under the act.
but i think you might 
no, justice kennedy, i don't think that's what i'm doing here, and the reason i don't think that's what i'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to ira's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.
thank you, mr. estrada. mr. franklin, i think you have about four and a half minutes left.
i agree. segura  i forget what it is in torts. it's kind of a supervening, independent cause or something like that.
thank you, mr. cochran. the case is submitted.
of course not, justice scalia, and  and the court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this court has made clear, in the cases leading up to sandoval, culminating in sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.
well, but you haven't answered, i think, the question of whether the government is entitled in this case, if we dispose of the 1231 question, to resort to the other statute.
justice scalia, the  the answer  a couple answers. first of all, obviously, we could not have raised this before the  either the district court or the court of appeals because the law was absolutely settled in the eleventh circuit.
that is correct. those were proceedings that were noted on one of the briefs. i think it's reasonable to presume that congress was aware of the variety of prison filing deadlines when it enacted this statute. and i also think that it's reasonable to presume that congress intended for those  for whatever grievance procedure the state sets forth to be governing in this instance. and this is because, under the former version of the statute, the cripa, congress had required that grievance proceedings comply with specified standards, specified federal standards. and in the new version of the statute, congress dispensed with those requirements. and i think that the obvious conclusion to draw from that change was that congress was intending for  whatever prison procedures are established in any given situation are those that are going to govern the inmate's appeal process.
i'm not saying controlling.
can you 
yes.
the case is submitted.
that is  under the compact, that's correct.
that's  as to the issue of predatory pricing, plaintiffs, as we make clear in our brief, actually submitted a predatory pricing instruction three weeks before the trial. you tend to be overinclusive pretrial. defendant on the other hand surprisingly submitted no such instruction on predatory pricing. the judge submitted a paragraph that had something more than what the current, or the ultimate paragraph contained. there was a debate over whether it needed to be, whether it was consistent with brooke group. i agreed with the other side that it did not have both components of the brooke group test. judge panner and i had a colloquy where ultimately he was going to turn one paragraph into two, include a brooke group test. we then withdrew our request for that instruction, weyerhaeuser objected to the, the thinned down version of the ultimate paragraph. but the interesting thing about weyerhaeuser's relationship to this instruction is that they really invited the linguistic framework of this, "bought more than they needed" or 
okay.
and that may well  that may well be different. and that's why i 
in 26.
there is a residual category in the definition of personnel action which says, any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. that's the residual category. but one of the specifically named categories, before you get to that, is a decision to order psychiatric testing. now, if that kind of a decision could be a personnel action, why couldn't a decision to conduct  to conduct a drug test be considered a personnel action?
that's right. and so the question is whether  and what petitioner is really saying is that the aedpa 1-year time limit should be suspended essentially indefinitely as long as the petitioner wants to argue that he may have some late-discovered claim in state court.
correct, your honor.
well, yes, but i think this court is always hesitant to draw inferences from 
there's no sense in which it's redundant, though. it would have been the first piece of paper that this court would have seen in the matter.
add to justice stevens'  add to justice stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.
and otherwise not.
well, could they have said that construction means both modification and then come up with a new word, alteration? because the statute says the term construction includes modification, so i  construction can be broader. could it be an alteration, they would come up with a new term of art, and add that  official
well 
was that because the government was entitled to the reciprocal easement? is that why they said that?
 you can't enter without probable cause.
well, i don't think 
it's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs.
why not?
because?
what  what do we look to in order to verify what  what you've just said? do the michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time? and if so, what's the standard that they use?
well, that's exactly 
that  that 
 but it's only invalid as an eligibility factor. it's not invalid as a selection factor.
so you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?
that's insufficient to prove a violation of section 2?
i looked up, my law clerk has, and found eight states that seem roughly comparable. those that go to assessed value, every single one of them  and most of them do  they have the word like "assessment. the only comparable places we found are puerto rico, philippines in 1916, and guam here which don't use the word "assessment," but use the words "aggregate taxable value." all right. now, what's happened in those places? we know what's happening in guam. i can't  with the philippines in 1916 and puerto rico, there ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't find a case how they treated it.
thank you, mr. salmons. mr. bergeron?
the  the thing is, is 
i understand that, but it's not going to support you enough unless you connect this anxiety i'm having now about this being buried in page 28 of an affidavit when it's an important condition of the warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word anticipatory. and there we are. now, you tell me why this anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected to something in the law.
may i clarify something about this case? are any of the indigent defendants whose rights the respondent attorneys want to advance  do any of those people themselves have standing to bring their claims in federal court now?
yes, yes.
no, your honor. he was not 
perhaps my memory is faulty, but as i recall your opening brief, many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence. you were dealing not simply with what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it said  it didn't use the in whole or in part language. instead it said directly caused. so that's the limit of what we can deal with, whether the in whole or in part should have been in the contributory negligence. but it was your brief that spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for the railroad's negligence.
and ultimately the result would be, there's no protected 
well, my understanding is on  on occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case. where there are several objects to the conspiracy sometimes for purpose of simplification, the government will just  will charge a 371 
they didn't receive actual notice. and, of course, this court has routinely said that there's no constitutional requirement that they receive actual notice.
the line is violated here, your honor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that arise in the prison context.
yes.
by the defendant's family.
respectfully, they are altogether separate concepts that procedural default is a total bar to the courthouse.
the whole amount.
you've thoroughly confused me now.
it does not. first and foremost, it doesn't vindicate 
well, the question is objective reasonableness. and we don't dispute that some circumstances may present such a situation that no one, no judge is going to disagree that the situation, at the state court, if it denied the relief on the three buttons you posed was unreasonable.
 there 
 the burden 
what?
any more than in the  in the hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our soil.
 and  and the crane operator was the  was operating it and the water came over the freeboard and it capsized. that's  that would be the perils of the sea, wouldn't it?
and the  the next question i wanted to ask you is that if it is possible there can be a single-district challenge, what is the justification for the  the cracking of district 24, which was a majority democratic district before, into five different districts, none of which would elect a democrat.
was the word employer used in the pleadings?
okay.
or could he just be found guilty of murder, or whatever, on those facts?
can you point to any one governmental action for which you do not have an existing remedy?
under florida law attempting to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is the same thing. dwelling is defined as the building or the curtilage.
it is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. the statute says 
now, what the ninth circuit said is, we'll give you a hearing. we don't know if you're right or wrong. what's the standard for giving you the hearing? i  a lot of things in the law aren't always written down exactly, and i was under the impression that trial judges often give hearings on what you might call seat of the pants. i'd like to hear more about it. i've been on appellate courts where rightly or wrongly we've said, i just think i'd like to know more about this. i can't quite understand it. let's have a hearing. and we're going to tell the trial judge to do it.
so, what i'm suggesting is that it is not merely a matter of damages that's at issue here, but the entire validity of title ii.
so, there, you're saying that the post office is just  it's just like everyone else with respect to automobile accidents, right?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
our 
how could you have? it's so tiny.
and  and i suppose, in this case, in the hypothetical we propose, that the california courts and the california bar would have disciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who hypothetically told the junior attorney to mislead.
wherein is it different?
the difference between that immunity and powerex's status is what? it's simply the fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing immediate appellate review, federal appellate review of the determination of the remand of a party that claims to be a sovereign as opposed to powerex's status as an organ?
what would that be here? official that he drove the car to the border? that he got out of the car? that he presented a document? what  if you could do it over again, what would the indictment say?
of course there is 
i'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an apa-like structure, saying to the states, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position. then if the minimum elements of form are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no reason to interfere with the states. let them do what they want. only those minimum elements are what you can't do. that works perfectly for you.
i thought the question here was, was he dangerous in the courtroom? was he going to lash out at a witness or try to 
i think 
is there anything wrong with the policeman himself taking a sniff?
i'm sorry, justice ginsburg.
thank you, mr. gartlan.
the objective is fine. the important thing is simply to hide the ball.
 trying to get rid of that, right?
i mean, taxes are at issue  are the only thing that's at issue in this case. but i agree that holding this parcel to be a reservation would have implications for regulatory jurisdiction, as well. now, there isn't a categorical rule of federal law that says that states and localities absolutely cannot regulate conduct on tribal lands within the reservation. rather, there is a preemption test  there's certainly a thumb on the scale in favor of an exemption from state and local regulation where tribal reservation lands are involved.
thank you, mr. hart. mr. estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining.
all right. so i am  in alaska, virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper. they enroll and then they're bound by it.
well, i will be more specific. and if i could also just point to what they grounded their case on here. they grounded their case on here, in the declarations, on the notion if the united states regulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then other countries will follow suit with respect to the emissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas emissions. that's clear from the mccracken declaration on page 239, paragraph 32 of the ja, as well as the walsh declaration.
you're  i understand.
but he says, by the way, "if i win, i will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses" 
well, let me  let me stop you there because this is something i didn't understand in the brief. you speak of the texas probate court determining the validity of an estate plan.
absolutely, that's true. if you look at the  the 
no.
if you're tripping over mail, and the mail bag has mail in it, there's no liability. you're harmed from the mail. if it's from mail apparatus or, you know, a postal employee's leg sticking out while they're sleeping, then we will admit liability for that. the focus  our view of the focus of this exception, i think, by its text  and this is exactly what the court said in kosak  is on the handling of the mail, and that is a very important line for the postal service. they have to make hard judgments 
all right, now suppose  i don't understand all these legal terms here. imagine. [laughter.]
why not?
oh, well, that's  but now, in fairness, i think to the red brief argument  you've read the red briefs.
the impact on the interstate market is the same, and i think that 
so we just say your hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be would not be covered by the statute.
no, you could do it that way and the reason the government, i think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.
how much later?
okay.
no. no.
thank you, mr. miller. mr. phillips, you have four minutes remaining.

in the  in the face of a district court opinion that applied the good samaritan statute and threw the case out because no allegation could be made to come within the good samaritan statute. so, it seems pretty clear that they're doing something quite different from what you're suggesting.

 transfer claims.
who's paying them for this lawsuit?
thank you, mr. kneedler. mr. stewart.
right. right.
well, they wouldn't end up having lower standards. they  they would end up having a  a standard at the guilt phase which takes into consideration what the lawyer is or is not going to be able to do plausibly at  at the sentencing phase. and you know, those  those may be very, very difficult questions, but it's hard for me to say that either the standard is different or that a lawyer should  or that we, in setting down standards, should pretend that a lawyer somehow has to go into a state of oblivion about  about what's going to happen at sentencing if he gets there.
well, your honor, this case may be a little different from some, in that the precise issue that was presented to the federal circuit, the failure of proof, was something that was identified very early in the case. and it was presented numerous times to the district court by a way of a summary judgment motion, by way of the pretrial briefs. and the issue had not changed. and, in fact, when the 50(a) motion was made, at the end of the trial, the court may have noticed that it was made in a rather peculiar way, an attorney attempting to persuade the court that that motion should be granted wouldn't begin the motion by saying, "for the record." but that's what happened here. it was known, at that point, that the judge had made up her mind as to this issue, and wasn't going to change it, and, in fact, declined, on several occasions, to even listen to argument on the point. so, the filing of a 50(b) motion would seem to be contrary to the generally accepted practice that attorneys are not 
 there was an error of federal constitutional law, search and seizure or confessions or something, and now we send it back. and let's suppose further the state has no independent state ground, they are not trying to make the argument, whether or not they're trying to make it here. there's no independent state ground, no objection to problem, nothing. now, i read that one standard that could be applied is the structural error standard. a second is a harmless error standard. but i've never seen a case, but that's perhaps my ignorance  -that's whey want you to show me  where it's definitively established by a federal court anyway that there was a serious federal error, i've never seen a case where this court said, or i can't recall one, that the state applied yet some third kind of standard, such as, well, i know there was a very important error, i know it was federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely egregious harm. i've never seen that in the law. now, can you point to me in the law where, which will correct my lacuna?
if that's so  if that's so, then why does the venue provision which you were just alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. an offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought in  and then it says  (2) a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section. not under section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section.
why does the balancing only work if it taxes?
well, if i could go back to the way the controlled substances act operates, it does not permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on individualized determinations made by individual federal district courts making their own judgment about how serious the risk is. if a substance is going to be moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, for example, to allow medical use, that is done through a centralized administrative determination involving coordination between the secretary of health and human services and the attorney general, in which expert opinions are gotten and a judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there is an accepted medical use. in other words, there has to be not  a consensus, not simply an  a determination by one religious group or one judge 
if you  referring the court to the respondents' report dated may 5th of 2000, it specifically states 
the right-of-way over the government's roads.
yes, but the  the state exhaustion requirements in habeas are much tougher. of course, the state wants them to have to go through state exhaustion.
just so 
the preamble states 
i don't 
well, if you're going to let the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea, you've done, by  as it were, by the front door, what you can't do by the back door  i.e., by a diminished-capacity defense  because you're making the same point. the burdens of proof are different, but you're making the same point.
are there any extreme cases we could imagine where the police have a duty to protect the citizen? the policeman sees four people beating up on the victim, no race involved, and he just enjoys watching the fight. does he have a duty under the constitution to intervene?
i thought you said the other. that's why i was 
i'm sorry. what's the trigger?
i do not, your honor. i  i do not dispute the representations that have been made about that practice. but let me begin by saying, thank you, mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: this court should give the attorneys' fee provision of idea the same construction it gave the nearly identical language of section 1988 in casey and hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the cost does not include expert fees. respondent's sole argument is that expert fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as this court made clear in both casey and crawford fitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a well-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited to those  that modest category of costs that may be awarded under 28 u.s.c. 1920 and 1821. now 
but if they're told in this case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they would pursue the safe course and say nothing. i mean, you did say at one point in your brief that when a warrantless arrest is effected, the officer must inform the arrestee of the officer's authority and cause of arrest. but that's not true on the spot as a matter of washington law or constitutional law, is it?
well, i think it would be the former rather than the latter, your honor, since probable cause does not distinguish between what may be an unconstitutional act on the part of the government and one that might be motivated by a legitimate grievance.
nor have i 
then it's not a question of law. the answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?
but it  it is not inconsistent with georgia and ashcroft to say that for  for much the same reason, states have less flexibility in cracking influence districts once they have been established.
i believe in that situation the petit jury's verdict would stand.
so all those are  there are a lot of reasons. does that counsel in favor of our holding this? here we have a case that went on a jurisdictional ground. and if we affirm or reverse that jurisdictional ground from the court of appeals, we'll decide a lot of issues that will create guidance. we might not have to decide it, because texas may deal with it; or we may decide, if they come out the other way, they're wrong. but we might. and that's why i was thinking perhaps we should hold it rather than dig it, particularly because that other issue does have some authority the other way. i take it there's a treatise in the fifth circuit case which does say that the word "constitutional" here encompasses "treaty."
what's the authority for that?
that's correct. and we don't import dmt. we import a tea that contains an enormous number of alkaloids. and it was clear in 
but  but again, justice ginsburg, 11 that goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up 12 his crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to 13 reform his life, he's gone further and that makes this 14 crime worse and  and more worthy of harsher treatment 15 from a punishing standpoint.
in this  is there a statute of limitations problem in  in these cases if their dismissal is without prejudice?
 so you could not 
but is that 
is the  is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?
 the state could  [laughter.]
do we know that? i mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of ocr is? just because they haven't cut off funds 
is that open in this case?
thank you.
 because it was never issued.
yes, justice kennedy.
how do you deal with the brower case? that it was a 193  83 action against the police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder. and the court said that the roadblock was enough to give rise to a 1983 claim?
i think in  i think the rule would be in general because, first of all, it's not just remedies. there's other incidents of a cause of action such as statute of limitations, the provision here for expedition, and other things. and really when congress has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the communications act of other federal standards, it shouldn't be assumed that they all  that  to allow a 1983 action would just frustrate congress' intent in fashioning that particular remedy.
what would you think of a rule that said 
i think it was five months.
but  but if i may, but then justice rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the court  in his concurring opinion, that the court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch. and that just speaks volumes to me.
well, wait. in respect to that  i mean, is it open? if you win on the question of the standard, is it open, or would we have to remand it for them to argue, in light of the history, in light of what they do now, they, your client, with knowledge of infringement, actively encouraged users to infringe copyright using their  using the grokster technology, and, indeed, knowingly would include willful blindness?
i 
because of the parole's  excuse me  the probation search that was imposed upon him by virtue of the 
the  the circuit court made a factual determination that there was a significant and atypical deprivation. we would respectfully disagree with that determination, but because it was a factual determination, we chose to confine our appeal to the issue of law.
well, what do you think is the 
why did anybody mention him?
because it was encroaching on an area of foreign sovereignty. foreign ships are governed by foreign laws.
 to which he's entitled 
we don't think it's constitutionally required, justice ginsburg. it hasn't  we haven't moved to set it aside because it hasn't caused an administrative burden. there are currently only 49 inmates in the control unit at florence. in the last decade, we have only placed 118 inmates there, and so we were able to cope with these burdensome procedures with respect to those numbers. but it's important to note that what we do when we  what the bureau of prisons does when it was free to decide its own process is detailed at pages 26 to 28 of our brief, and that applies to a large number of prisoners, 550 who are in the general populations of  in very similar conditions to those in the ohio state penitentiary. and there we have adopted a much less formal process even than the one that ohio does, and we believe that is also constitutionally sufficient.
no, but we're not necessarily thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner that goes from liverpool to miami or something. that would be covered.
i  i don't think so. i believe that the way includes is actually used, for example, in the definition of attorney general, opens a long definition which is itself exhaustive, but leaves room for change. attorney general was written in a way that allowed any official to be designated by the attorney general to fall within that description. there's room for designations and there's room for change in the justice department as it occurs over time.
and 
here you're saying you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. it has to be based on reasonable factor other than age. and i take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.
well, what we're getting  at least what i'm getting at was this is, i would probably have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and  has nothing to do with the death penalty. and i would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide. congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide. it's rather like the tobacco case, except a fortiori. now, what's your response to that?
i'm asking you a 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
well, i think darden established the rule. this court applied it to the penalty phase in romano, and thus the darden rule that if a prosecutor's comments, the totality 
what page are you on?
i thought you told me that congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the seventh amendment.
yes.
you were the petitioner.
i think the test would be the same. that's 
why phrase it as a presumption? why not phrase it, "we determine california law to be, unless we hear otherwise, having examined what it does in other situations, that 60 days is timely"?
 to the psd?
but i'm saying 
but your honor 
the court didn't say only 
well, your honor, i'm sure the federal government will also address this question, but the parameters of the water quality standards are addressed in section 303 of the clean water act. and there are parameters in there. and the states' clean water  or water quality standards must conform to those standards. we submit our clean  our water quality standards 
well, i mean, don't  don't we have to take judge giles' statement as being a statement in good faith unless there is a pretty darned good reason not to?
your honor, that presumes that  that we don't have things that we can do along the way before it comes into the attorney's hands. this is a very interactive process.
okay. well, don't fight it.
well  well, i will, i assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the solicitor general's office to tell you what  what the doj has and hasn't done. what i can tell you is that  that the doj manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these  these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. so i can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.
congress has drawn a distinction between preferential transfer claims and contracts claims. however, this court has noted that the difference between an action to recover a contract claim in order to augment the estate and an action to recover a preferential transfer in order to augment the estate, that there really is no difference. both are 
in this case, we contend that the state removed latino voters from district 23 because they were latino and that 
 a reasonable 
but ohio versus roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability of these statements. it was overruled because of a judgment that the founders wanted there to be cross-examination.
well, i don't know. we have  you talked about  just for fun i got out of the library a book by professor b. s. yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists  now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. now i didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did i find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book. there's one interesting thing about the book. it was written in 1966. so i guess my question is what's changed? now i know two things have changed. one is there's evidence in canada, britain, and in the states that were under miller-tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down. that's changed. and the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, i gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers. now, i see those two changes. my question to you is looking at yamey's book which is called resale price maintenance, so you might have found even it even on google, and  what's changed? what's new?
they can't compromise the requirements of article iii.
well, he  that  his point is that the event at issue happens every day.
yes.
but, justice breyer, in this case i think that what would have had to happen is that the petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in order for the act to be properly done. he moved for 14 days.
there are two answers to that, justice ginsburg. first of all, they are not the same commodity because they said  they were asked and they said it was different. they maintain the difference. they seem to think that it's different. secondly 
that's why i'm here, that's right.
but it's an equally arbitrary line if it's 16, 17, or 15.
yes.
yes, within 70 relevant days counted as the statute requires them to be counted, which includes the requirement of this finding set forth in the record before you can stop the clock running for  you know, for some period. i don't think that that's  i don't think that's very complicated.
the missouri pacific railway case holds that even this court, on review of a state court judgment following remand cannot review the remand order itself. it can review issues of federal law that were decided by the state courts on remand but 
was there any argument on the merits as to those four counts?
and in other words, is it really  although the language in the statute seems to go farther, is there anything really at stake here beyond saying treat us the same as you treat mainstream  members of mainstream religions?
i mean, in  in that respect, a contract that's void is no different from a contract that's voidable.
well this court has made clear, for example, in the three-judge district court cases, that this court has jurisdiction when an appeal comes before it, to decide whether or not it has jurisdiction over that appeal. when parties have made 
thank you, mr. olson. the case is submitted.
well, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the case, if we can?
i'll put this machine in your store for a penny. a penny.
 versus other numbers?
if you had to pay it before, there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time because nobody would have had any mileage. isn't that correct?
 is the  if it logically follows, from your position, about "choosing the causes we resist and the ones that we assist."
no, but i think  i think the justice was asking whether it was the court of appeals that 
so you want us to say something else here.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
 abrogate.
do we have a case involving price control where we have analyzed that as a taking?
well, you know, that would be much narrower, because it would simply be a drug test. i think it would have the problems of  the officer would have complete discretion. if it were like the california 
but  but what was  and the state trial court chose to deny the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on a variety of reasons, and it was chosen  he chose not to appeal that to the supreme court of virginia.
if he does that 
well, you say he has the opportunity. do you actually tell him you are about to be reclassified or our proposal is to reclassify you because you violated this particular regulation by this particular conduct?
well, the recoupment is not in the output end of things. the recoupment is the opportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra costs you pay during the predatory period. and we had evidence in the record that a former executive from weyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy multiple times, that when it was questioned by some in top management that the head of a division would always say once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor, we will recoup those costs many fold. that's at ja 260, cliff chulos. we also had at ja 903 a planning document in 2001 where weyerhaeuser was showing in that powerpoint chart the expectation that log prices would be going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent change downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to the bottom line. there was no plan to pass on the benefits of those lower input prices to consumers. obvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation. also as to recoupment, if you look at ja 831 to 95, which are the year-end financials for the weyerhaeuser alder mills in oregon, washington and bc during a roughly four-year period, you see a monu  a huge price differential between the prices in british columbia and those prevailing in oregon and washington. we think there was every expectation on management's part to drive the prices down to the levels that prevailed in british columbia, which works out to about $40 million a year, way way above the amount they were spending in this predatory scheme predominantly in oregon and washington, because there is no competition in british columbia. but i would like to point out that they never preserved the issue of whether or not the standard that the ninth circuit in dictum stated was as a whole sufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of anticompetitive conduct. at page 43 of their brief after quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they note, although that statement of the law  this is 43 of the ninth circuit brief, not the blue brief that you have  although that statement of the law may have been acceptable when reed brothers was decided, it is not in the wake of brooke group for reasons explained above. the point here is that they never made any charge in the ninth circuit that the instruction was flawed independent of brooke group. now we concede, if brooke group applies, the instruction was  was  is wrong, and the case should be reversed and remanded. but the second point that they try to make in their briefing is not properly preserved. and in fact, i'd like to point out that they contributed to the linguistic framework of this instruction in a very significant way. first 
now  now, if you want to say there's a more wooden rule and a  and a more iron rule here that was prejudicial, i think that's something else.
that they are not to the extent that, justice kennedy, you're asking whether it is an interracial threat. it is  it is undoubtedly true, taking the example of the crips and the bloods, that they are intra-racial threats, and indeed prison policy directed towards separating crips and bloods because of the  of the intraracial problem is certainly one which would be something that the  the prison system should address.
well, justice scalia, there's a couple of points to be made about that. one, as this court recognized in reynolds  in the reynolds state secrets context itself, even the provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations have been made, the  the provisions of going forward and handling classified information necessarily involve risks that the information will be disclosed. in the first place, both totten and the state secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld from the case. it's an absolute privilege. so the idea is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the case and that's somehow all consistent with the state secrets privilege. to the contrary. once a determination is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further disclosure of the information. you  the whole premise of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate disclosure to the general public. it's that once something is privileged, you  you treat the matter as privileged and you take it out of the case.
no, i wouldn't say that 
mr. chief justice, we got a ph.d. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25 years.
the parties actually have a concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing agreement in that regard, justice scalia. on page 399 of the joint appendix is the provision about which they have a dispute. and the language in there provides that they will pay on substances which would, if not licensed under this agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or both of the shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction. there was similar language in 
as it exists now and based on the washington supreme court's decision in hughes and recuenco, those individuals sentenced before the washington legislature amended the act would simply be entitled to have their cases remanded back for entry of a conviction based on the jury's verdict.
i think there is a good 
and the, and the opinion suggests  not merely suggests, determines  that those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it applies, were ineffective. the government raised other remedies and the court said they were ineffective.
well the sec has said it depends on the circumstances. and they draw very fine lines in this area, your honor. and if, in fact, the sec concludes it is a tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes. but that's the critical issue here. it is very easy to term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but when the nasd looked at a real complaint of this sort in the invemed case it found that there was no excessive compensation and no commercial bribery. and 
you're sure that happens, that while cert is pending here there is a habeas proceeding ongoing in district court?
 that's where this  this distinction that you're drawing can be taken into account.
the court's almost issuing an advisory opinion in a way.
 going into the bar, and he gets jeered by all his friends because he likes beef.
 any other factor.
when you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both.
 there may be. so you may agree with your friend, mr. hopper.
doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own? as i say, i don't think most people know what the text of the ten commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from god. that's what it stands for. why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the state of texas to use it?
i  i put it that it's not the same because they  first of all, in reality, that's not what they did. but let's talk in terms of the hypothetical that  that you've asked me. it is that you have to also look at what actually happened in the wesley trial to determine due process for stumpf because wesley  what happened in this case through the whole circular reasoning, wesley didn't get the death penalty here because they were informed that stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to death. now 
if the court were to step back and say that the "otherwise" clause should be interpreted in a noncategorical manner and we're going to  the court decides it's a factual-based approach, in mr. james' case there are no facts, so it may not make any difference for him because there's no facts to indicate what kind of burglary really occurred here.
yes. i think 
thank you, mr. phillips. the case is submitted.
that would be true. now that would be inapplicable 
you think it would be better if he hadn't been stopped? if  if they just  just randomly walked up to somebody who was going through a toll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that would be a better case 
can i,  i'm not sure it is even that he made a mistake. it is even worse than that. if he gets it right and finds that you are a sovereign 
yes, but voidness is a question of public policy. the state itself makes a decision that certain contracts can't be entered into. and the question of voidability is usually one affecting the  the will of the contracting party.
you  you think 
any jury that thought this  this person did not deserve death would have ample opportunity to give expression to that determination under this scheme.
that was all presented to the jury, right?
it really isn't as pedestrian as it may have seemed. we underwent a change in the law, in aedpa, that the court has recognized is not fully clear. and so this was one provision the court had to clarify in artuz v. bennett, and there was a very small number of cases. i think we totaled eight in which relief was granted because district courts had incorrectly barred a petitioner from the first petition because it really wasn't a violation of  of the statute of limitations.
justice scalia, i this it would be surprising for this experienced court and all of the patent bar  remember, every single major patent bar association in the country has filed on our side 
of course, in the vast majority. let me give you some examples, and then i'll distinguish it official from this case. the easiest example is rate of return regulations that the fcc can pronounce. so the fcc can say how much long distance companies are able to charge for certain services. fleshing out the amount that they can charge so that they're not in effect gouging consumers is a regulation that this court could look to, but 
and so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldn't do.
but this court held only 3 years ago that the statute before us here does not permit the attorney general to hold the alien indefinitely.
is the one other  the interest other than the interest on being able to tax an item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because of the economics?
the guardian ad litem cannot proceed pro se?
your honor 
and  and i'm  you know, i don't remember the names of people involved in  in prior cases in this court. i  i  you know, if we said 
i'm wondering you  if you have a claim against counsel for being incompetent in letting a settlement be made without notice to the  to you. it seems to me hard to  hard to understand how this could happen.
you could do that by law. you could do that by law. you could specify that only certain waste facilities can be used.
it preempts class actions. and it's significant, because congress made a policy judgment. originally, as originally introduced in the house, slusa would have preempted all state-law securities cases. all of them. as the statute wound its way through the house and the senate, it  and principally in response to testimony by the sec commissioner levitt, who went to the hill three separate times on this legislation  specific statutory exemptions were put in. but it  getting back, though, to the purpose behind 
 "i'm withholding the money because i want to express my message."
well, your honor, this provision, up until the last part which says, and expenses incurred by the parents, the  the last clause of this provision was added in the conference. and the conference report makes that clear at page 7. the conference report makes it clear that the house  the senate recedes to the house bill. the gao study provision was only in the house bill, with an amendment expanding the data collection requirements of the gao study to include information recording the amount of funds expended by local educational agencies and state education agencies on civil actions and administrative proceedings. that clause was added, your honor, in conference. prior to the conference, the provision was very much the same as it is today. so 
no. the law in the sixth circuit is in fact in conflict with a case  an earlier case, mckenzie v. smith  had determined that the  a decision with that language, that virtually identical language, is not  is not entitled to deference.
i think there is a strong argument which can be made that both the automatic stay and the discharge decisions infringe upon state sovereignty. however, this court's decisions, dating back to at least new york versus irving trust in 1933, have made it clear that the states are bound by the provisions of the discharge orders. i think, also, the automatic stay is something similar to the ex parte young doctrine, in terms of the states being enjoined from doing something else. however 
i appreciate that and yes, your honor, i have.
the hue and cry reports, justice scalia, as i think your earlier questioning suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of emergency situation what  that we have here where a person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal act against them and seeking help. and the fact that we have very little evidence at all of how 17th century british law handled this is really, i think, persuasive evidence that the court should not deem the confrontation right as a response to some sort of abuses in this area.
i've paid for the eight, and i can't operate at all because i haven't paid for the ninth.
i think all issue ads that come within the statutory prohibition are permissibly regulable. i think 
thank you, dreeben. mr. cochran, you have three minutes remaining.
i  i would defer to ms. bunn about that because i don't know about other cases, but 
is it  is it the vessel that's the problem? why  why do you focus on the vessel? it seems to me most of your argument has gone to whether it's in navigation. can you be a vessel that is not in navigation?
another blood question because i  the  you make a point of the  the sheriff having said, well, i  i saw blood on the jeans. so i looked at the pictures and the pictures seem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of mud. so i came to the conclusion that no reasonable person could think that that testimony really shows that the  that there was  there was blood from the  from the victim on his jeans. now, am i right about that? you're going to think i'm wrong, and i want to hear why.
 there's two different problems.
but 
no, no. i wasn't 
the  the connection there was  in essence, yes, your honor, based upon the inseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which were immediately adjacent to the navigable water. there was nothing that separated those wetlands from that specific body of water. they were immediately adjacent and intersected with that body of water.
i don't assume that at all. even if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes, you're right, they trespassed, good for you. i mean, what is the remedy if they did trespass? what administrative remedy does he obtain.
i think that that's essentially the same question in this case, with the one significant difference that here there is a domestic 
yes. and i thought that we had to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects the new policy. and if the state complied with the new policy, what is your complaint with that?
i'm  i'm asking 
well, they're taking out loans against it. they're  they're not withdrawing the money.
you were talking 
no, your honor, i don't believe it does.
 because it's clear that under  at the time of the constitution, the burden of proof on all of these defenses was on the defendant. and that was also true at the time the fourteenth amendment was adopted. the burden of proof was on the defendant. there was some evolution after that. now, the  the other thing i wanted to talk about with respect to davis is it was based on the understanding that the court had about the relationship between the insanity defense on the one hand and the mens rea element of the crime on the other hand. and here, there's simply no corresponding overlap. whether or not the petitioner acted under duress, she knew she was lying when she filled out the forms, and she knew it was unlawful for her to purchase firearms. so there's simply no relationship between the duress defense and the mens rea element of these crimes. congress has also overruled davis by statute, and we don't think it would be appropriate for the court to extend davis to a new defense when congress has rejected it with respect to the only defense that it applied to. and  and there's  and certainly congress acted constitutionally in overruling the davis decision under this court's decision in leland and in other cases like martin and patterson, which say that there is no constitutional problem in putting the burden of proof on the defendant for established common law affirmative defenses. and 
thank you, mr. crawford. the case is submitted.
they understood contributory or comparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis of negligence. they made a distinction in, in the fraud claim by only awarding a little bit more than $21,000, even though the request was much higher.
i tried. you've read a lot of cases. you're a patent lawyer, and so what is the understanding as best you have it of what is just meant by the term "motivation"? to be more specific, if they mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, anybody would want to look in the prior art. if i want to invent something i'll look anywhere. i'll look to the prior art. i'll look to the library of congress. i'll look to my cousin. i mean, i'll look wherever i can find it. so they can't mean that, and if they don't mean that what do they mean?
yes.
well, the  the portions of 2 his life history that  that are the most appealing are 3 the portions from his youth, before he went into the  4 into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly 5 with him during that period.
that's exactly right. there are no cases from this court speaking to this precise issue, are there? on which there is a disagreement among the lower courts?
exactly, and that's the language 
right.
 paragraph 2  okay.
i'm not asking about your intention. let's assume you do intend to litigate further. what for?
 right. but it is a felony under south dakota law. and what the statute says  and that's the government's argument  they say "any felony punishable under the controlled substances act." they don't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act.
by its text, the statute speaks to removal and that the attorney general's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal. but i think 
and that is what is either on the master disk or, although either side obscures this, that is what is represented in the electric  electronic transmission, that is another means by which the code is supplied. and in paragraph 7 of the stipulation microsoft acknowledges that it supplies the windows object code by transmitting it to manufacturers overseas. and the way that happens is the code, the machine language, is resident in redmond, either in the pits and lands of a cd or on the varying magnetic orientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from microsoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is taken and converted into photons which stream whatever it is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the atlantic ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a bit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there in dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive, it's converted from photons to a series of electrical pulses.
 "under the controlled" 
no, your honor. and i'm assuming your question is asking me, grant certiorari based on an application filed by the petitioner.
yes, mr. chief justice 
i mean, it seems to me it's not like rocket science. you've had study groups and everything. well, you just tell the policemen give them  give them the advice. end of case.
yes.
let me ask 
 because in the vast majority of cases  i'm sorry  due process will be satisfied because notice will, in fact, be received.
but 
but we don't talk about a leg dying. we talk about the fetus dying, i think, and i think that's not the leg.
oh, i certainly hope 
 be an abuse of 
but whose fault is that?
and it didn't do that here?
 if they had been on notice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be an issue, they might have put more in the record about the sufficiency of the evidence.
no, no. i  what i saw is he is driving down one lane, what i mean by weaving, and this lane goes with me in traffic. and there is some cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where the cars are now coming right directly at him. and then before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and he does this while going through a red light, it seemed to me. am i  did i mis-see that? i'll go look at it again if you 
well, i don't think it  i mean, i don't think it's  it's deceitful, the  the possibility that a court 
there would have been, at least for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
in the mail, correct. and that's why i believe the three days was added, thinking of the mail rule that we have three additional days to do it in connection with the case. and that's how i believe the, how the 17 days came up.
no, i 
because it's not filed in an "action," which refers to a suit in court, following occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes the terms "action" against "administrative proceedings" 
it would be very hard to prove, it seems to me.
okay. well, that goes to the very heart of why we believe this is a  a legal claim and not an equitable claim. if we look at the particular plan provision here, it allows mamsi to totally avoid proving any double recovery. and let me  let me give an example, your honor. there are 36 states that have limited the collateral source rule. under the mamsi plan here, if a particular plaintiff recovered money in a personal injury suit, it clearly could not recover all, in some of the states, part in other states, of its advanced medical expenses because they came from a collateral source. nonetheless, under the plan, as mamsi has written it, they can recover their full amount, and there's nothing equitable in allowing a boiler plate provision to authorize the plan to get contract damages.
yes, and i agree with that. it is when it comes out an air pollutant. but is it an air pollutant that endangers health? i think it has to endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air at all.
well, so that a 
well 
no, your honor. i don't.
i thought your argument on brief was that it is pending here and the statute says pending. it doesn't say pending, as your statute, you compared it with says. that pending, the application is pending someplace. where is it pending? not in the state court anymore. they have reached their final judgment, but it's still pending in your case here because you filed a petition for cert.
it was raised but  but he was not given an opportunity for a hearing on that. justice
you know, it's not an insignificant matter at issue here. counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis. when we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for federal district judges. why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result?
well, if you prevail in this case, then could suits be brought by the tribe to evict current owners of land on the historical oneida 300,000-acre reservation?
and would you agree, mr. marcus, that this court's decision in shepard excludes that interpretation? if you look at the particular crime?
 we could look at  look at it from the perspective of the habeas statute.
are you talking about both collateral review and direct review, or just collateral review?
 or state the reasons that the statute specifically requires. and the question for the court is what flows from that failure. and the answer is given in the sanctions provision. it says that if more than 70 nonexcluded days elapse, the indictment shall be dismissed. now, that provision itself builds in flexibility to take into account exactly what your honor is talking about. a judge may dismiss without prejudice to re-prosecution depending on various factors, including whether it was just an oversight, a failure to recite words. so that's where 
 as a practical matter.
would you think that the hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do look at the individual case?
at any time.
but what for?
your honor, it has to do with expertise, as well. that's precisely what this court 
and  and in your view, that justification allows the creation of district 25, which has, as far as latino population, people of quite different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know, the  the two-ended  the district on the two ends.
if not, i don't see how that would work under your rule.
and then there was a jury trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said there  there was basis for qualified immunity.
right.
yes. the  the courts were asked to take judicial notice of a number of things. they 
right.
yes.
not at all, justice o'connor. this case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client standing cases, the triplett case in which this court unanimously found standing for a  for a lawyer representing black lung claimants, and the caplin &drysdale case in which this court found standing for a third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal defendant. and what those three cases have in common and what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a case in which the statute or law being challenged disentitles the client either through loss of funding or through, like michigan's law, a statute  disentitles the client to representation. any other change in the law, tort reform brought up by my 
well, it's curious that they make that argument, because of course every victim of a fourth amendment violation has the right to damages for at least the invasion of their privacy, for the antecedent conduct between the time of arrest and charging. at a minimum, mr. wallace had that coming to him because he was, according to the illinois appellate court, illegally seized.
and we readily satisfied that, both on the face of the complaint, which identified lincoln property company as a texas corporation, and in the remand notice, which identified its principal place of business as texas. even the court of appeals had no problem calling it a "texas parent," because the corporation documents, which are part of the record, amply demonstrated that lincoln property company is, in fact, a texas corporation and satisfies those requisites under the diversity jurisdiction provision. the  instead, what the fourth circuit has done is to erect a standardless forum that will increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting courts to make inquiry about parties and entities that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the purpose of determining whether or not there are jurisdictional spoilers.
each state is free to charge its  its own amount as the plating fee.
thank you, counsel. mr. srinivasan, we'll hear now from you.
well, that  the government certainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we note in our reply brief, the statistics the government cites don't really back that up. i  but we do  we do acknowledge that, with respect to social security retirement benefits, there will be many people who are beyond the 10-year bar. with respect to people who get other sorts of social security benefits, that's not clear at all, actually. there are survivors 
no, but a 
are you claiming that hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase "at no cost to the parent," if they have to hire an attorney, that the cost 
that's what i was asking, yes. and you think it will go back to them and they will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is not enough by itself? you really expect that to happen?
well, in  in this case, your honor, it does in two ways. it does because the relief that it would allow has only occurred, in my estimation, once in the post-teague world since 1989 when teague v. lane was decided, and the only other instance would be when this court would find a right is both  initially recognize a right and find that right retroactive in the same case, which in my understanding 
 in peer-reviewed journals, it was not.
so you say that that was wrong in this case too.
and the district court has substantial discretion in determining whether or not to grant that hearing on that basis.
 earlier. the solicitor general says it's inherent in the concept of proximate cause. in the absence of reliance, you don't have proximate cause.
and i think that means that they will give great deference to what the  what the wardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of  of the penal system.
but we 
that's correct. the prosecution in the wesley trial originally did not want the  the jury to hear at all what happened in stumpf's trial. they wanted to argue the complete  that  that stumpf's verdict was not even  should be informed. the sentence of death shouldn't be informed or the sentence of death. and in fact, that's when they started to throw in a little bit of the alternative theory after that evidence did subsequently get in. the record shows that they originally did not get it in and they allowed the defense counsel  prevented defense from getting  in the wesley trial from getting in the evidence of the stumpf trial.
thank you, mr. howe. general clement, we'll hear now from you.
why does the respondent bear the burden? you have the burden 
i would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business.
yes.
can't imagine that.
well, your honor, since that time in anderson and as timmons and other cases cite, if the regulation is a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation, then it is a proper regulation as far as it is applied to all the parties. in regards to the requirement of registration, change of voter registration, all of those are applied equally across any  any party, whether it be the libertarian party, the democratic party, republican party, or any other party which may be recognized at that time in the state of oklahoma. and back to justice breyer's comments, the period of 7 to 8 weeks prior to a voting  to a primary election is actually a very short time as compared, for example, to rosario which this court 
am i not right?
 the four acts 
well, i  i was going to agree and disagree. i agree that finley was a federal question case. that, however, doesn't go to the point of what this court said about the words, civil action. what you said was the 1948 recodification came relatively soon after the adoption of the federal rules of civil procedure, which provide that there shall be one form of action to be known as civil action. consistent with this new terminology, the '48 revision inserted the expression, civil action, throughout the provisions governing district court jurisdiction. and what the court held is there's no meaning to those words, especially when the revision is more naturally understood as stylistic. so the words, civil action  and when you look at 1332, which is what zahn is based on, if their interpretation of the words, civil action, was correct, then zahn was wrongly decided and snyder was wrongly decided.
far be it from me to suggest an argument that you don't want to make, but, i mean, i've found it different, in life and law, when you pass a rule in a state that guts an act, from when you pass the rule in a state that doesn't seem to have much to do with the purpose of the act.
the court need not decide anything more broadly than that.
well, justice scalia 
 no matter now unreasonable the california statute might be in other applications.
right. that's just 
they can't settle your claim out from under you.
 not be reviewed, that there's no appeal, there's no review process for what official the grand jury did behind its closed doors, whether we open the doors or not.
 had nothing to do with the commerce clause.
mr. waxman, may i just ask this question? i don't understand what the import of this order on page 51 is. i have it in front of me. what did that do? is it anything different immediately after the order entered than 
okay.
that  that was  simply neither party suggested that anwr fell within the first provision. and it doesn't. it's clear that it doesn't. it was not land that was specifically used solely for conservation of wildlife under these three listed statutes. the anwr reservation at that time was set apart. it was blm land. it was also used for mining and other activities. likewise, the other matters 
right.
how do you square that with  with the purchase of block insurance like this?
why should we say that's the question, when the federal circuit, itself, said what i read before from 10a?
fine. you've given the procedure but where does the act guarantee the parents the proper outcome? the proper  assignment?
oh, the answer is no. you're right.
they said: we don't negotiate.
i mean, this is a prison classification, for goodness sakes.
given.
but on the  on the question whether they preserved the issue, i  i took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. they did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.
by means of a private action before the fcc?
no.
thank you, mr. moran. mr. baughman, we'll hear now from you.
general abbott, would the texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in wisconsin put on its monument?
in  in the tying product. excuse me. in the tying product.
well 
may  may i finish?
the key would be if it's mandated, voluntary 
but that's the  that's the problem. that's why this is a special category of evidence. it's not any evidence. it's third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that any defendant could try to introduce in any case. in any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get, whether it's jailhouse informants or  or whatever, where the person who did it was often somebody who's just recently died and  and is not there to present an alibi of his own. in every case the defendant can come up with this evidence, and so you have a special rule that's designed to deal with that. and all, it seems to me, that the state court decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's case, is if  if the prosecution's case makes that an  unreasonable under the gregory test that you agree with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that you're guilty. you may have all sorts of other claims that you can make, but you just don't get to present that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that kind of stuff.
and let's  let's assume that there's no better reason for the rent control for the building, residential building, than there is for the rent control on the lease for the gas station.
may i ask you this? supposing a state passed a statute that said that the following counties shall hereby be designated arms of the state and be entitled to immunity, period. would that provide an adequate defense, do you think?
well, but it's also a question of, "how much of it was he there for?"  as in green. was he there when he  was he there for the planning stage? because the jury is to consider all of the evidence. so, if he 
it would be a false statement in the label. the label happened to be false, a misrepresentation in it.
were you saying "binding," or are you saying that we "show deference to" the president's own interpretation of the treaty, as applied to this 51-case set? in respect to that deference, i suppose, he interprets the treaty in such a way that the avena decision, in his opinion, as applied to this 51-set  -case set is what the treaty means.
well, then why is it moot? because something could happen. we might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going. so as long as  you're prepared, i take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. if that's what you're going to say, i don't see how the case is over. it's up to you.
well 
yes.
with respect to the telephone long-lines, you say, yes, you are; and with respect to cable, you say, no, you aren't.
 the reason why they set this timeframe for holder claims is that those kinds of claims that you're talking about, justice scalia, would be a classic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring that in federal court. and that's the point here, that, where you've got long-term holders, and you've got people who purchased in the '80s or in the '70s, and they're being induced to hold for decades, and they may want to make  they may suffer their damages as a result of collateral that they want to borrow against  they have no practical means of recovery 
interbrand, interbrand competition? do retailers like interbrand competition?
i 
there's really no need to get to that point here, because the beef board, which is the entity that does the speaking, is, i think, unquestionably a government body. it's established by special statute under the lebron test. all of its members are appointed by the 
not to  no, i wouldn't characterize it as to alibi. any evidence that goes to the sentencing questions the jury must consider, to deliberation, to 
it is.
a firearm includes pistols and revolvers because a firearm is something  anything from which a projectile is fired. so 
that's true, your honor. that's true.
so that even though  if i understand it correctly, even though there had findings that some inmates have been improperly  had had inadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new facility, they can just stay there until the litigation is over.
i thought that there was no state law issue in this case, that the whole thing turned on what kind of notion  notice was sufficient to convey title.
thank you, ms. chatman. the case is submitted.
well, you may leave the jurisprudence where you found it, but other attorneys might not. and i'm  i'm concerned with the consequences of your rule. there are many reasons, it seems to me, why a counsel may not be able to represent the  the client that has chosen him as  as the first choice.
and that remains.
did you say  you say that the fcc is changing its view. it has tentatively changed its view. so it will bracket the telephone companies with the cable companies.
in the nordic village case, the trustee in that case focused on the money damages. they didn't focus on the portion of the preference statute that says you can get the transfer back, you can get the property back. and as this court recognized in bowen versus massachusetts, just because it is monetary relief doesn't mean that it's money damages. and that's how we distinguished the nordic village case, your honor. the  this court, i believe, would be extending the article  its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy estate not to be able to sue the states. this court has recognized that a private citizen, indian tribes, and foreign sovereigns cannot be sued. but this court's never recognized a federal entity cannot pursue a state. and this court  this is a situation where there is no alternative remedy. we aren't in a situation where we have the ada, the adea, where the eeoc can bring an action on behalf of the government and on behalf of the individuals to enforce a federal law. we have no other enforcement in bankruptcy, other than the collective bankruptcy process, the bankruptcy code. and the bankruptcy code assigns to the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to collect on behalf of the estate. bankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application and its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the bankruptcy system. the framers recognized the critical nature of binding the states in a uniform scheme. the decision below ought to be affirmed on the basis of in rem, on the basis of the constitution, and on the basis that virginia, the commonwealth of virginia, waived its sovereign immunity. thank you.
yes.
i would suggest  i  we concede there's that distinction. however, i would suggest it's irrelevant for purposes of how congress would have understood the term "exhaust" in enacting the statute. the definition of the "principle of exhaustion" in administrative law is one in which there's an obligation to comply with the agency's grievance proceedings. and so, that is the definition of exhaustion that congress was presumably  i would suggest was presumably invoking in this context.
well, it's anything that allows you to browse the world wide web and to  and to retrieve information from the world wide web.
and if he's denying that inventor, you know, the  what he'd give to bell labs  or whatever bell labs is these days  that does practice the inventions 
it is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual. that probability exists at the time that the warrant is  is issued.
but in  would you clarify something? is it the correct interpretation of the california law that the  the california court held, in effect, that you may not consider the fact that the crime was heinous and atrocious for purposes of deciding whether he's eligible for the death penalty, but you may consider that fact for the purpose of deciding whether to impose the death penalty?
well, i guess that's where maybe we  is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. i'm not sure i agree with you that the latter is the case.
it does mean that, your honor.
right, but the warrant 
counsel 
 maybe you should modify the standard. maybe the standard ought to be that where you have an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the police either have to negative the implication of those questions, the relevant implication, or the state has to show that some other series of independent events, such as justice kennedy mentioned, made the difference. that is, caused the later request to talk without a lawyer. and if they can't show the one or the other, then they lose.
no, but neither should a superior be required to get a report from a subordinate that he thinks is way off base, just a result of poor judgment, thinking that there  that there was a violation here, when there  when there obviously wasn't, or using facts that were not sufficiently established in order to claim such a violation. surely, the employer is entitled to say, "on the basis of this report, which you gave me, you're fired."
yes, but they're doing it for a functional reason. the functional reason is that if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's going to get into the navigable water. exactly the same argument can be made as you go further and further up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you concede, as i think you have to, that there can be a regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water at the point at which the  the pollutant is added, then you have to follow the same logic right up through the watershed to  to any point at which a pollutant, once added, will eventually get into the navigable water.
no, and  they did not  and i 
well, that's why i asked earlier that your  your statement that all of this was done with a political motive  i wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement.
can you file  can you file a request for a more specific statement in habeas, as you can in a civil case?
justice alito, i don't think that it is that difficult. i think, in fact, it's easier than strickland because in strickland, you have to look at one lawyer and decide whether his performance was not competent and then hypothesize what a competent lawyer would have done, and then conduct the counter-factual inquiry of how it would have affected the trial.
you're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations. collier, i think in context must be saying, you get paid the money. i mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?
 there would be no question that it was a real marriage.
well, i mean, if  but the state standard always has to  has to comply with the federal requirement, doesn't it?
i know it approaches the problem. i'm wondering if it gets there. [laughter.]
well, is that fatal to him? i mean, that's what we're  one of the things we're trying to get at i guess. is  is that fatal to him?
conduct contrary to self-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement in the absence of direct evidence.
 of conviction  to determine the nature of the crime.
isn't that part of your due process case?
it  in  in some circumstances, yes. if it changes its main office 
but is it correct that they address the same subject matter? isn't 60(b) directed at the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas aedpa is directed at the integrity of the original conviction?
that's classic going to the weight of the evidence. that goes to the weight, not the admissibility.
no, i don't think you do either, but i mean, i think your whole argument has got to rest really on the potential for harm in the commission of the offense.
what did it 
that's correct.
well, your honor, i think that you could have said that the definition of "statutory maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was at issue in apprendi. and in fact in the apprendi decision the court specifically, i think in response to justice o'connor's dissent, explained that walton versus arizona was still good law. and as you know, in walton the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first degree murder, but they could not receive the death penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a hearing. and it seemed to say that the statutory maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings would not take you above that statutory maximum. i think that 
well, we did put it in the first time in this case, and we don't necessarily need to rely on the eighth amendment, we believe, to put it in, if 
yes.
i don't know what they are.
what about where it has an atm.
thank you, mr. himmelfarb. mr. meade.
yes. and there's no question that congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute. this is not like st. cyr, where they didn't go after 2241 in terms. there's nothing subtle about this statute with respect to the clarity with which it speaks 
why? i don't understand. i mean, there would be even more expectation taken out after the fraud is announced. i mean, it's just like saying, you know, besides  besides fact that our ceo just died, there's no gold there. don't you think it would go down still further?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
because there are more legal elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review than just those that you've named, justice stevens. section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for review, mandates that the district court consider the guidelines, consider the policy 
your honor, it wouldn't disappear, but it might alter the  it would alter the balance. if the  what is troubling here is that the state has asserted a right in predictability, but the state's right in predictability is only coming at the expense of a refusal to accommodate the tribal interests in the say way it accommodates every other sovereign. and so, we do think that that goes to the strength of the state's interest here, and to the state  the strength of the  of the state's assertion of its tax.
and it says  and it says "offsets under this section."
 where do we get that? i mean, where does that come from?
well, if you want to make it an issue, you'd have to get the  the predicate in the record to do it, and  and we just don't have that.
if the court would like to change that law, it's  it's up to this court, but that's how we come to this case.
 suggests that exception.
 make us 
so it has 
that would depend, your honor, on the prison, the prison regs, the state. i can't answer that question 
which in other words, he details in the petition the subsequent history that would have resulted in a new judgment.
does this come up very often? i think the case  the issue you want to raise, because i would think normally there's a motion before the trial, well before the jury is empanelled. the defendant says: i want you to dismiss this; the indictment's inadequate. and if that's even close, i would think normally the prosecutor would go back and say: fine, i'll get a superseding indictment, and that would end the problem. and it seems to me so likely to happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling against the defendant and then it goes through a whole trial almost never happens.
all right. so what happens in the case where  justice blackmun let us go further than that. he says the indictment  that's the charging document  or information and jury instruction. he'll let us look to a jury instruction as if there's actually been a trial. so he'll let us go further than you will.
you're not at the whim of a monopoly seller. you mentioned to me just a little while ago, you've got a contract with them. you can put in that contract whatever you want about pricing.
i think, justice breyer, with regard to lane, the right that was at issue was not the right of the paper to send a reporter, it was the right of the reporter 
well, not under those facts.
it would have  well, it would foreclose consideration of all present good-character evidence, i believe. it would  it would have foreclosed the consideration of boyde's evidence, of payton's evidence.
so  so  no, but i mean literally. as  as long as  as two illegal workers are going to be hired, isn't that sufficient to convert  to go from conspiracy to  to rico on your analysis?
may i comment 
right. go back to then  you have to go back to 12(a), i think it is where we talk about the interpretation and we get to construction. this is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay, of an emissions unit. so that  and modification, if it is undefined in title 51, right? according to 15.100, official means whatever it means under the statute. so that just takes you back to the statute. and this is the interpretation under the statute. the 52 interpretation is also an interpretation under the statute. so it is completely circular and brings you right back to the same definition. i agree by its terms it doesn't apply to 51. but going through the definitional provision in part 51 through the definition of the trigger for construction, which is modification, it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same provisions. so there is no difference between the two. and to me, it is really critical. and it seems to me there are sort of two points to make here. one is nobody on the petitioner's side of this case answers the state  the dozen states who say we relied upon you when we adopted these sips. we realized that you are asking us to take on enormous burdens. and you should have told us that before we went down this path in the first place.
negligence 
there has to be an articulation of the determination of probable cause to the holder of the restraining order to allow her to, for example, clarify facts, to perhaps talk to a superior or perhaps, in this case, go somewhere else for help, go to the court.
because, first of all, it is not offered and is not considered to specifically determine whether it rebuts an inference that the state has raised on factual point key to their case. secondly, the nature and quality is not a consideration in arizona.
all that is true, but i think that the court below and the other parties say  almost everybody is on your side. however, they also note a problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid structure of aedpa and the imagination of lawyers, that if 60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the aedpa restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b). and so i can accept everything you say, but if that in the back of my mind is a concern running around congress in this way, what form of words could you put in to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in which it's been used so far? now, the criminal justice legal foundation filed a brief in which they tried to do that. i thought that was a constructive effort. so what's your opinion 
we're talking 
general clement, couldn't a similar record be made with respect to what is the more common procedure, the d&e, that involves dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb. so assuming you're right that it is constitutional for congress to ban the d&x proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning apply, couldn't congress make similar findings with respect to what is the most common method for second trimester abortions?
what is it that the government could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do, that they cannot do simply by  by reason of  of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?
i always thought the governmental proprietary distinction really came up in state law cases involving municipal liability. that's principally where it 
we're talking about the confession being coerced, that the statement given was coerced 
i think it would be open to them to consider. i also think it's a matter that when we get to that point at least 
it could certainly impose penalties of some kind.
no. they don't  the regulations don't require this informal process. it's typically done official 
i see.
no, it wouldn't be. and i think i want to flesh out and make sure i've gotten across the distinction between the rate making 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
 i think your opponent would say the district court made a finding to the contrary.
it is, your honor. the issue here is  is whether calderon extends to this situation. we think it does.
in fact, that paragraph refers to effectiveness, as i read it.
no, but  but 
 i can  i can believe that they do that. [laughter.]
if  if at the moment that it's made, the declarant understands that jack being back in town might be useful in an investigation, or if a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would understand it, that would be testimonial. yes. yes, your honor. so the  the basic principle for which we're advocating does not lie at the  outside of the  of the definition of testimonial. i think it's simply a core proposition.
that's probably right.
that's true. but we know from the record that volvo's purpose in this enterprise was to eliminate 50 percent of its dealers 
well, the  the  an argument to the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a psychologist would have said about christopher simmons, as a group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile personalities that it is impossible to know whether they're  the crime that they committed reflected an enduring character is an argument that could have been made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not have been credited or given dispositive weight, particularly since at sentencing  and this court has acknowledged this in cases like pate v. robinson and drope v. illinois  the jury is evaluating somebody, determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.
would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?
"sometimes the most, 60 days. so, look and see if it was filed within a reasonable time. that's all. and if california passes  some specific thing says something special about it, of course, pay attention to that." what's wrong with that? they just would do it like they do any other thing of deciding what happens in 
your  your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when congress wants to  to rule the world and say all ships in the  in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly. it doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity with respect to american ships.
i'm talking 
well, answer that question 
i think that under a sort of a  theoretically that's a  that is a theoretical possibility, justice souter. i don't think that would happen a lot in actual practice because the sort of people who are prosecutional witnesses have a sufficient caseload that they're just never going to have in a  a actual recollection of specific events. and i can represent to the court that 
well, your honor, in the first instance 
but that was based on the question of involving you know, normal operations or non-normal operations. the court really didn't have to address  and i don't think did address the question of how do you relate 
you paid the lower paid workers more?
i think they did more than it didn't  it just didn't matter. i think they urged the position. it would  i mean, a lot of the cases in the lower courts have made that distinction when the  when the state comes in and says, we don't know what happens. we can't tell you who the shooter is or not, and we don't care who the shooter is.
yes. it says that for the court of appeals, you need leave to appeal. i thought they were doing something there. what were they doing?
well, if that's the case, then  then doesn't the premium that you're supposed to pay depend in  in  on the number of employees within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on their working in the last 180 days?
so you would confine the rule to what the officer has seen at the time of the arrest.
i thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, i have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what i had to  what i had to say in lopez to  was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. so i would have thought, given the  and i believe that, you know  but, i mean  but that was far further than this, which is just direct.
well, bivens is.
and again, ineffective  an ineffective assistance claim doesn't give full effect because under this court's cases, if it's  if it's in the rubric of ineffective assistance, you leave strategic decisions to the lawyer, and so if 
we have to deal with each of the six one by one, and  and they have arguments with respect to each of them. i don't care what rand said. those things that you said sounded very good. but if he finishes it off by saying, right now i say that, but tomorrow i might not 
exactly. a claim for conscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession or the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of those claims, and use of the confession at trial is not an element of those claims, and those claims would accrue at the time of those acts, just like the fourth amendment rule that we urge in this case. only where there is a trial right and use of some evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at trial, something of that order, if the trial right is implicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial. that is different from the fourth amendment claim, of course, because 
i  i will. well, i will. i'll respond in terms of the city of chicago. city of chicago is a case where you have issues, claims within the federal question jurisdiction. additional claims in the case arise under state law. they are not within the federal question jurisdiction, but they are related to the same case or controversy. the court said, with no difficulty, both for purposes of 1367 and for purposes of 1441, that is a case within the original jurisdiction. it's a civil action. in both statutes, the same language. it's a civil action within the original jurisdiction. and  and if that is the case, in a federal question case  i think i want to  i'm going to get to the important point here. this court has many, many decisions and many other courts have many decisions saying emphatically that when you add a party or when there is a party in a case who destroys complete diversity, the court loses jurisdiction over the entire matter. to my knowledge, the last time the court said it as a holding was in the schacht case a few years ago. there are, i think, dozens of cases from this court. we cite about five of them on page 24 and 25 of our blue brief. that is a fundamental principle and it is because the concept of complete diversity is a relational concept. it depends on who the parties are in the case. as has been said many times, the requirement of amount in controversy is individual. the fact that a party submits a complaint and the complaint has one party, as in our case, whose claim comes within the diversity jurisdiction and includes other parties who we agree their claims do not come within the original jurisdiction  does the fact that those claims are all put on the same piece of a paper, put on a complaint, does that mean the court, the trial court, lacks jurisdiction over the first claim as to which all the requirements are met? there are no nondiverse parties here. we have complete diversity. we have a claimant who meets the jurisdictional amount. we have a civil  a civil action within the original jurisdiction.
yes, justice kennedy. our position is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the controlled substances act or one of the other two federal statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18 u.s. code section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an aggravated felony. but there are three additional textual indications, in addition to simply the "felony punishable" language, that misdemeanor offenses under the controlled substances act are not drug-trafficking crimes under section 924(c). the first one is, there are other provisions of section 924  (e), (g), and (k)  where congress actually used very similar language. it referred to conduct punishable under the controlled substances act or the two other statutes, or offenses under the controlled substances act or the two other federal statutes. but then, it added an express reference to state offenses, so  official
it 
no, but that's because there was a tax on the first sale to the first distributor. and may i ask this? supposing 
your honor, we believe that the same principles would apply to class action lawsuits as to other lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigation proceeds. it may very well be the case in a number of class action contexts that when applying those principles, the proper  the proper analysis leads to the conclusion that the taxpayer doesn't exert sufficient control and that the payment of attorney's fees is not in response to a debt owed by the taxpayer. and so there might be a different result.
no. the  the problem with adopting the  the 18-year-old line is that it is essentially arbitrary. it's the kind of line that legislators and not courts adopt.
well, let's  justice souter, if i  if i could, let's look at the particular sources 
i see.
well, give me one instance in which your proposed interpretation would work in the real world.
under $100. under $100.
so your  your answer is yes.
but that's based on the defendant's  the prosecution's conduct. the government's conduct in entrapment concerns how the government behaved.
what about  you talk about deterrence. what about their not getting promoted? i assume that  that police departments, even if you have some maverick officers, that the administration of the police department teaches them that they have to knock and announce. or if it doesn't teach them that, then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the city, not just the officers. and that  you know, that's a deep pocket.
i think what is proportional is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe.
the kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this court has distinguished from in god we trust, god save the united states and this honorable court.
yes, at some point, it could where it was clear to the reasonable observer that it was there because it was an old object.
well, your honor, the unique circumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there wasn't an act which if requested could have been properly done.
and also in footnote 1 in the  in their brief on the merits to this court. i think it's on page 7. my reading of that is that they are not challenging the due process analysis, and it would be premature to challenge the due process analysis at this time, which is what the court said in webster. we believe that our due process argument is stronger than the due process argument that was made in webster, but the court in any event said that's not what is  what is before us at this time. and  and we believe that that's the same situation now.
justice ginsburg, title vii allows proof of dissimilar treatment as evidence of present intentional discrimination, but it's not the elements of the claim. as chief justice roberts was pointing out, title vii would prohibit paying a woman the same amount as a male if the employer would have paid the female more because she had a  more degrees or other criteria that the employer ordinarily took into account. the elements of those two claims are fundamentally different. what makes this case untimely and unactionable is that there is no claim and there can be no claim because it's the law of the case that goodyear took miss ledbetter's sex into account during the charge filing period. what goodyear did was the same kind of neutral rule as in evans. what goodyear did was it said, we are looking at the pay rate contained in our payroll system, and applying those rates as they are mandated for all of our employees, male or female. and what goodyear did at the beginning of each evaluation period was say, we are starting this payroll period with the pay rates that were paid in the last period for all of our employees, male or female, no matter what their prior causes.
well, i don't think we need to do that because there's been a concession in this case that mr. mcdonald is not a third party beneficiary under the normal rules and is asking, instead, that the court create new rules, rights greater than third 
okay.
okay. then you're  then am i right in characterizing?
and so what we're saying here is that when a state shows that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show that they do.
could you describe it again? because i'm not clear what your answer was to what the appellate court stance is. i take it the appellate court would owe deference to the district court's determination?
what is your answer to justice scalia? because i thought you said before that you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case back so that they could redetermine in light of proper considerations whether they wanted to exercise their authority.
well, there may be events that 
the  the purpose of edwards was to prevent police questioning. so, when a curative measure conveys that, the police are not going to question any longer.
 exactly like title vii, but 
right person to ask. (laughter.)
what if the state law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?
yes, we're 
how does the common law research exemption figure into this case, if at all?
mr. kise, we'll hear from you.
but in digital equipment, i think that we said that the collateral order doctrine is narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should give it  we should be very reluctant to expand the practical construction of section 1291. and this certainly would be an expansion, would it not?
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
i should clarify that 
yes.
it's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think? maybe what congress should have said, although congress doesn't always speak precisely, is that any  any state law which contradicts a provision of the contract on these particular subjects is preempted.
no. it only says it shall not apply if it comes within the exception.
no, your honor, i think the thanksgiving proclamations would be constitutional. i think it's analogous to the legislative prayers that this court upheld in chambers v. marsh. i think it's very different than this ten commandments monument.
i do think the barnes line of cases that include with it walker v. brown and  and other cases fully stand for that type of a proposition, that  that if you have committed to something that  that requires the return and recovery of a specific item or fund, that is it. i think that type of thing would also fall clearly within the realm of specific performance, which is a known exception to contract-based claims that falls clearly within  within the realm of equity.
no, your honor. i think it  it either has to describe a crime or identify the perpetrator or, as in this case, do both. so 
that's correct. congress could 
apart from the lack of popularity of the state's view 
and sometimes it's wrong.
but you  that was your claim, and i 
i  i think, first, under  under jones v. barnes, it's been held by this court that there are three fundamental things that only the client can do, one of which is to plead guilty. and in  in the roe case, the  the record below was  was unclear as to what happened as to whether there was a duty for the attorney to file an appeal and what the conversations were or were not with  with the defendant. but we would submit that  that a guilty plea is something very special because that it goes to the heart of the case.
 court holding, they would certainly be free to introduce her live testimony. it's very clear from the oregon supreme court decision that any alibi evidence comes in, and that's not limited to evidence that was presented in the guilt phase, or even witnesses who had been in the guilt phase. and  but coming back to what the court's holding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be used in the remanded proceeding. and not only does it come in, and the primary statute on  that they dealt with for the grandfather's testimony is really a statute that deals with admissibility of evidence  prevents the parties from having to go through making foundations and other showings in order to get evidence admitted. but, under the oregon supreme court holding, defense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that the jury should consider the possibility that defendant is innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the sentence.
but we're told that the  those methods are less gentle to the patient, the methods that the state of oregon has authorized its physicians to prescribe. we are told, at least in some of the briefs, that, from the patient's point of view, it's much less upsetting.
well, i'm  i'm assuming that it's not res judicata in  in the narrow sense of the doctrine, but it's  it's still a bar that depends upon a  a prior judgment. and in that respect, it's sort of res judicata-like. conversely, there is  there is no immunity in the first instance conferred directly on the employee as such. and so that's  that's why i  it seems to me that there's an argument that this is a lot closer to res judicata than it is to classic immunity.
all right. so we're looking 
 and clearly exists under this scheme, it seems to me. any jury that  that really thinks this person should not go to death can  can do it. in fact, you know, i guess the statute does not demand that instruction, but that instruction that says  what is it? the appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be a mitigating factor. i mean, gee, what  what else  what else do you have to do?
it's a minimization as to what they will transcribe, isn't it?
 commercial objection.
it has not been applied again since then, but we would say it's settled law as a result.
no.
 are 117 listed 
it's a question about how much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?
the  the situation with the  the term of new york law that i am  that i had indicated would occur during a trial of the case and in terms of my cause of action. it would not affect blue cross' lawsuit against my client.
there were several reasons for the denial, one of which was statute of limitations, but the court also noted that even if it had been made within the statute of limitations, there was no merit to it. the record reflects, your honor, that mr. bustillo's retained trial counsel was fully aware of the vienna convention claim. in fact, he was the son of salvadoran diplomats and was familiar with vienna convention issues. he made a strategic decision that it would be better to  to contain his client and to contain the amount of people talking to his client and, therefore, he should not raise the vienna convention issue at trial. and that is set forth in the affidavit of retained counsel, set forth on pages 318 through 319 of the habeas record in the fairfax county circuit court.
even granting your assumption, justice ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the  is that the birmingham board would be subject to  to a private right of action for damages and fees even in  in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.
not exactly, but what they did was they headed it off at the pass. they understood that 
well, two answers. if it's a close question, if aedpa and if kotteakos and brecht mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the state and are not overturned by the sixth court on review.
justice o'connor, i  i couldn't agree more, and that's why it goes to proof. it says this is a proof statute 
well, let me address the specter of all these claims for tv access, because i do think that that's something that can be taken care of in any number of respects. one is, a sensible application of turner-type principles to the reasonable-modification standard can certainly be done in a way to weed out those claims. i also think  especially given justice kennedy's principal concern with damages, i think here's an area where the plra is particularly helpful, because i don't know what kind of physical injury you're going to be able to show to being denied access to the tv room. and since that's what you need to show under the plra in order to recover any damages for mental and emotional suffering that i suppose you could try to bring a claim for emotional suffering for not seeing tv  i'm not sure which way that would cut  but, in any event  [laughter.]
and if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.
i  i agree with that, your honor, and i hate to argue against my position, so i  i do this gently. but at the same time, the court has noted and  and one of the old saws of american law is  is it's better one guilty person should go free than that one innocent person should be punished. and if the state knows, as a matter of fact, that it secured two convictions for a crime that only one committed, the state knows at that point that it's punishing at least one innocent person and that might violate 
well, if it is a member, jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation?
so  it's  it's brand new to us. we  we didn't think this was in the case at all.
well, yes, of course the chances are. but there's a possibility he didn't.
but the person who heard the witnesses is special trial judge couvillion.
what about a rule that says you 23 must consult the file of the case that's being used by the 24 prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance, 25 at least where that file is readily available, and you 1 must follow up indications in that file that suggest a 2 significant mitigating defense?
well, i think that certainly suggests that he's dangerous right off. in terms of whether or not he's dangerous in the courtroom, there's other facts that are conspicuous upon this record.
when you use the term bona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor. do courts evaluate the bona fides of someone claiming a religion?
mr.  mr. coughlin, i'm afraid you've had a full opportunity to explain this very difficult case. you'll have to  your time is up.
that is correct, justice stevens.
but this is an important point for me, and i wasn't quite clear what the briefs told me about it. my understanding was that there is an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir, the impoundment area, that there's a stratification, and the oxygen components at different levels change, so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's qualitatively different. it's the same water, in a sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its oxygen and other characteristics. and that sounded to me like a discharge.
thank you, mr. smiland. the case is taken under advisement.
and in that case, justice ginsburg, if i could just briefly 
would you state again what you say the second error was?
i don't believe so. i think that's very common 
no, no. it's a question of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury. the jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the  quite proper for the trial judge to say, "you can't consider that, because there was no evidence on it."
so you think it  you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?
because all of those various combinations can still be attacked under the theory of rico by just simply structuring your  your enterprise in the proper way. it is true you can't broaden it. you can't expand the enterprise definition in order to include a variety of different elements, but there's no way  i mean, in this case, for instance, they could have named mohawk as the enterprise. they could have named the  the recruiting agencies as the enterprise. they could have named the corporate officers as the enterprise, and they could have dealt with all of them as a conspiracy. and all of those are ways to get at precisely the issues that you identify, justice breyer.
you've given us, in your multifactor test, you said, "objectively reasonable basis to remove." and another factor might be that the plaintiff delayed in moving to remand. what other factors, besides the "objectively reasonable basis to remove" and the plaintiff's delay?
yes.
it is. i'm confident it's an open question.
well, it  it just makes me think that  that instant contact is not what was envisioned by the treaty.
it happens, in this case, to be specifically authorized by the constitution.
your honor 
 the sheriff's department  -
no. it  it is a federal question, your honor. this court 
i think it's partly fair, your honor. what i would say is the time  certain time is consumed just determining whether or not under the rule 4 screening process, whether or not the petition meets the formal requirements, whether they've articulated the claim in the correct way and whether it's worthy of the state response, if there's discovery that needs to be had. i mean, all of these things can be taking place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more than that  and i don't pretend to have the exact number or the statistics  but in the very, very usual circumstance where cert is actually granted, i think then a stay could be put in place. and i don't think it's fair to say, respectfully, that congress intended to forestall this entire process while this court undertakes certiorari review.
well, you won on it.
 so it makes every interstate 
but if he had gone into the federal court he went into, and he had not gone through this state procedure, he would have been turfed out.
the records need to stay with the inmate at the old prison until the inmate leaves on the bus for the new prison because 
now  now, once i made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where states have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine.
i don't know whether the framers considered it but i do know 
and is that a functionally regulated subsidiary?
 have the heavens fall  we don't want the heavens to fall.
 the tax. and there is  there's no such parallel here.
they have to give warning. but why is the  why is the cigarette analogy different from this case? what is your answer to that?
at the same time, i think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. not what  quite what the test says. so there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there  was it harmless? could a reasonable jurist in california have concluded the opposite? okay. so maybe we should do it in this case. we simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words.
we could just say whatever its scope is it ain't this. i mean, couldn't we do that?
but you dispute, as a matter of fact, that lincoln property company is a texas corporation?
that would be effectively overruling lear, which is what, i think, is what many of the parties in this case actually seek to do. lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to patent licenses. a licensee can challenge the validity, the enforceability of the patent. that's because there's a public interest in this, as well. parties cannot simply contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a  to a patent 
well, i'm assuming they show 
correct.
well, we said that that would be an appropriate line. but the question here is is it really essential to an appropriate line that we talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery.
i'm sorry. i don't understand the question, your honor.
is that correct?
i believe that for tax purposes the attorney's right to the funds  that's at the moment he receives it. so if he doesn't have the funds in hand, he wouldn't be liable for federal tax. it would be at the point he either receives the funds 
they do not reference a  i'm  this 
from everything  from everything you said, it sounds like you're  you're taking issue with riverside bayview because if a wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a stream that goes right into it? what sense does that distinction make?
your honor, it can deter it, and it can deter it significantly, because, first of all, there is a much more significant opportunity to identify the illegal activities; and, secondly, if a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer knows that, that operates as a powerful deterrent 
well, this points up the distinction in this case between guilt phase and penalty phase. and what we're talking about here and the rule that i am urging this court to adopt relates to the penalty phase. and in the penalty phase, like mr. deck's, we have a person who's been convicted of murder. now, in a guilt phase, certainly there are issues of presumption 
yes, and that practical distinction i think does support congress's decision under the equal pay act as well as under title vii to choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's frequently that even if an employee knows she has been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very difficult for her to have a good faith belief that that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more information. so for example, if you look at that chart on page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes the pay decisions for one of the years at issue here, if petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got that year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent raise which is not - which is not suspicious. if she knew what mr. conte had gotten, she would know that in fact that pay raise decision decreased the disparity between her pay and mr. conte's pay. if she knew what also happened with respect to mr. bice she would see he got a higher absolute raise than he did, but she got a bigger one than todd. it's only if petitioner had all of the information in this chart, that she would know that that pay raise decision increased the overall disparity between her wages and the average wages of men doing the same job. and even then the amount of that disparity, standing alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason to go claim intentional discrimination to the eeoc.
yes.
well, what it tells you, justice souter, is why the united states has an interest in enforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes to defraud that are carried out using the united states wires.
that's right, your honor. it's not harmless for the same reason the later period is not harmless because the statute says that if the defendant is not brought to trial within the time limits, the indictment shall be dismissed. and it makes very clear that in the absence of an ends of justice finding, the time is not excludable.
well, why don't we focus on the court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by justice white. he said, "hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand." and then he said, "whatever you can say about the twenty-first amendment, one thing is certain, the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition." that was this court's explanation for ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant industry of pineapple whatever.
yes. we  we  that  that quotation was a  a description of what crawford described as the core.
ms. karlan, the  as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are  there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. one thing that i don't know and may be of some significance, did the rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?
no, what the other side is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when it would be in the interest of each of the alleged conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged something that gets to the threshold of plausibility. that's their argument and i, i 
yes, so each one could be in many states. no?
does the government have to pick one overt act and say that's it, when it introduces evidence of a whole string of them?
 eighth amendment 
no, justice ginsburg. first, you must assess factor (k) facially and that's what boyde did. then the next question is did the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to believe that they could no longer consider payton's mitigating character evidence. and that would be the second component of boyde which is a general test for assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood the instructions in the context of the proceedings. and the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this case is the california supreme court's application of boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the proceedings.
i don't think this can properly be considered a deterrence argument. when you say over and over, this is far more important than william weaver, this goes way beyond william weaver, this is bigger than william weaver, this doesn't just pertain to william weaver, then you add that in with the number of comments about you need to give this person the death penalty 
if it's their homestead, not  not for every property that is  for which taxes are not paid, but for 
well, why not?
i think if the information and  and the instructions were read in that manner, the state was wrong to concede that there was blakely error here at all because, if as a matter of law, a handgun is automatically a firearm, there would have been no blakely violation at all. but that's not the case.
would  would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply  if his  the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, judge dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?
to the global. and so, the reduction that you could achieve under the best of circumstances with these regulations would be a small portion of that, would it not?
well, if you're filing a petition, you have to have some expectation that you might end up here.
of course. but 
but i thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of  of this  this individual. and there's nothing in the facts of the  the scene that would lead the government to have any access to that evidence.
thank you 
pre-1985.
that wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?
let me ask one because i think you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute, which is the  the statute sets up a perfectly good way of keeping this branded stuff off the market. all any complaining farmer has to do is to go to epa and ask them to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction. it's like the atomic bomb on the company. and so that's very strong. and the only thing that leaves out is the possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your damage remedy, just go to epa and tell them to give it to you because they can write the rule the other way that i was suggesting.
would they, on  in  on these facts  i thought not, but perhaps i was wrong  the  when the police come to the house, they don't suspect anything about cocaine. wife then accuses husband of being a cocaine user. so, that's the first information the police have. could they get a warrant, just on her say-so? in fact, they got the straw that had the cocaine residue on it. they went to the magistrate with that straw, and he gave them a warrant. but if they had nothing but the wife's accusation, "he  he's a cocaine user," would that amount to probable cause?
the middle level 
do you think congress 
i'm sort of back where justice kennedy started on this. forget  i'd like to forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a case where parties argue reasonably about whether the contract itself covers this kind of fee. and maybe it doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera. but let's take a very straightforward case. it's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection. it clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language. and now there must be many instances or some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.
but whatever position holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power plants, and has there been any application to epa with respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?
what about having a 
typically they do not, your honor. the typical iep team meeting has the school psychologist perhaps, has the  the teachers of the  of the child. those  some of those are required members. it has the parent of a handicapped child. it might have the  the service providers like the speech pathologist. and when  when it comes to a trial, comes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who come and testify as to what they know about the child, the test results they have. there are no typical consultants or testimonial experts that appear for the school district. so the  the central part of this statute, its  its revolution, where it brings parents of children who are disabled into contact with the  with the school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling the promise of this statute. energizing the litigation aspect of this by transferring those costs to the school district will  will take away and will detract from the  the true meaning of the statute, which was to build a partnership between the parents and the school district, not to let it dribble off into litigation. thank you.
 ms. lee. the case is submitted.
 importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.
 is an accurate description of 
mr. chief justice, here i was referring to the district court and the ninth circuit following the california supreme court's decision. they came to the courts and said there's one thing that's different. there's one element that's different, and that is nollan and dolan. heightened scrutiny should apply to a financial exaction of this sort. the california supreme court disagreed under california law. we want to litigate that issue here, and they did. the district court ruled against them on the merits. the ninth circuit ruled against them on the merits. they petitioned this court in question 2. this court denied review. in all other respects, their claims  their case under their federal claims, which were not claim-precluded, were, as the district court found, quote, based on the exact same facts and circumstances argued before the state courts. now, they  their case here boils down  and it's quite clear from their reply brief, and mr. utrecht has reaffirmed it  to an argument that this court's 1963 decision in england ought to be extended to the williamson county context. now, i believe that england is distinguishable  highly distinguishable from the facts or the circumstances of a williamson county remand for any number of reasons that i can explain. but ultimately my point is this. england is fatal to them. if england were extended to this circumstance, they would lose, and that is because in england, the court was entirely clear that as to the state law issue that the supreme court said should be presented to the louisiana courts first for determination, there was no doubt that issue preclusion was going to apply to that. the question was whether or not principles of preclusion would bar them from coming back to federal court otherwise. in other words, in england, the question  there was a challenge by chiropractors to a state law that said chiropractors have to go to medical school or something like that. a federal complaint was raised under 1983, saying that violates our fourteenth amendment rights. that's wrong. the supreme court said, well, wait a minute. we're not sure that the louisiana law covers chiropractors, and if it doesn't, we can avoid the federal constitutional question. so we're going to, in effect, certify to the louisiana courts the question, the state law question, whether chiropractors are covered. now 
i found it very strange.
what other than the periodical, newspaper access differentiates this custody from the next higher 
yes.
he hasn't been  he hasn't been  i think he's still in  in custody. whether  if  if he  if he completes that and is released, a question of mootness may arise at that point.
it's surprising that the holder claims didn't respond to blue chip. i think your argument would suggest they should have responded to blue chip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the state court.
no, mr. chief justice. we did make a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet, because it's never been covered. that reservation, if you go back and look at what the senate said at the time, and what  there are no plants. they're just not listed in the treaty. the purpose of the reservation was, in an abundance of caution, in case it would be  in case it would be added in the future, then plants, and solutions from plants, would be covered. but as it stands now, members of the native american church drink a tea containing peyote and 
i would say that that's a much harder case than this 
yes, justice scalia, but that's not how the  the michigan court of appeals works. the michigan court of appeals is an error-correcting court. and so in mr. halbert's case, the michigan court of appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to  to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented. that is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case. that 
and your evidence to the contrary that was excluded would have showed what?
 i think 
that's correct.
don't we 
 "i had to be at work. and that's why it took me all this time."
in the text of the statute?
it's a separate provision on the enhancement  or excuse me  as to the length of the enhancement that would be imposed does.
well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the california laws are concerned.
but your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.
well, i'm trying to understand what your 
exactly, and would you apply a different standard because there isn't a constitutional claim?
 on competition.
it just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee. so i take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, judge, don't give this direct language, because nothing requires it. and since, other things being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side. and they said the judge rejected that argument, so official now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have accepted it. and all the rest of what he's saying is just in case the court wants to reach it, or something like that. but what about that one?
which, if either, of those do you think is the primary state interest you seek to vindicate today?
with respect, mr. chief justice, this does not entail a heavy burden on the defendant. what the presumption does is simply presume from a patent used to effect, as here, a requirements tie. and justice o'connor, it's not just a component in the larger product. the patent has to be used through the licensing of the patent to effect the tie. we're not suggesting that the presumption attaches to any product that happens to contain a patent in the component. but when that happens, mr. chief justice, the  when the patent is used through its license to exact in perpetuity  you have to buy a requirement for life  it is quite fair to ask the defendant to come forward and say, well, that's not so bad because there are reasonable substitutes. we just looked at them when we got our patent in order to show that it was novel. we looked at what the prior art was, and we've studied our competitors and the printhead market closely 
 what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?
it is.
where is it? where is it?
i don't care whose position it is. the language does not admit of that exception. there's nothing in the language of it that would suggest that exception at all. what language do you rely upon for that exception?
it's 
but the problem here is the claim, the gravamen here is the government is doing stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it shouldn't do. i fail to see how it makes any difference to the people who care so passionately about this, as justice breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental expenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program. we don't do that in any other area of constitutional law. if someone has been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure, we don't say well, you know, it was just incidental. yeah, we know you feel badly about it, but this was just an incidental search and seizure, and you don't have standing. it doesn't make any sense, given the gravamen that you're directing this law against, to establish such a standard.
it 
that's the problem.
 waive your  could you waive 
well, are there colorado cases that tell us how we should read those statutes?
but it's not just to those. it's to a lot of other people. i mean, that's 
now, if, in fact, he's being disciplined for that, the other side is telling you he has a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies. go to the bar associations. many states have laws, the statutes that protect people under these situations. and why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get the same relief which will short circuit all the other remedies? and if you do, there are going to be thousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll all run to  to the constitutional court. all right. so, now, what's your reply?
the automatic stay is an exercise of sovereign  of the sovereign power of congress, just as the discharge decisions of a bankruptcy court are an exercise of the sovereign power of congress. the states are bound by the discharge decisions. states are also bound by the automatic stay. where we draw the line is where the trustee attempts to get a monetary judgment as a means of augmenting the estate, which is what is happening with this case.
why?
 relevant market enough to prove they're in competition with each other?
is there some way to avoid these problems now? has anything changed?
if you thought the fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that.
but not for the opening statement.
yes.
also to protect fish?
 that the district court should take these filings, should not hold them. it should itself make the retroactivity determination.
number two, you as a purchaser do not know about the fraud until the market finds out about the fraud.
well, is there any doubt, here, that there's no state law?
in that unusual circumstance, your honor, i think principles of equitable tolling would apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file.
are you saying that this  trial is  is one thing. appeal  but you say he would do the appeal over? he'd do the appellate argument over? do the petition for cert over with counsel of choice? there's a different stage involved.
and what if the defendant bribed a  an official of the new york revenue department to impose unnecessarily high taxes on the competitor?
if the conduct  again, we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry. obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far. other attempted burglaries are caught well before that actually occurs. but if you were to say that the attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to get into the place and the person actually didn't get in, again, under taylor, it says the risk is when the person enters. the risk is much less outside the dwelling than inside the dwelling.
yes, it is.
no, my question is under aedpa, if the state court said, you know, i'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?
both west and toro.
can you  can you ease my concern there? is there anything you can say that could ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll just be in state court with a different class?
there's a modest element of autonomy in the right of counsel of choice, but the right of self-representation is complete autonomy. there is no substitute for the individual defendant's voice in the courtroom. there is no representative that could give him that right. and this court has also recognized that the right to self-representation is usually a right that redounds negatively for the defendant. it tends to produce worse trial outcomes for the defendant. and in recognition of the autonomy as independent of fair trial interests that are protected by the right of self-representation, this court has placed it in that very small group of rights in which automatic reversal is appropriate.
i agree, it's not necessarily a trademark. you have to look at the totality of the ad, and you have to look at what the person is trying to use to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the products, or, in this case, the store.
right.
but you would agree that if they did make a judgment, then you would have authority to regulate?
and  and so i  but as i read it, there were many, many, many things involved here, and this is just one of them. so how can texas say that you have to prove this particular one as  as opposed to proving a lot of others?
articles 
what is your theory?
isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?
but if you read it as a whole, you can't find any ambiguity.
in the treaty.
 concede liability for that, because that  just like  that's not handling of the mail, that's handling of a building or handling of a vehicle, which we see different from handling of 
correct.
well, this is the hobbs act.
it is that resolution but it is specific to the second display because it specifically mentions what kind of documents are in that display. it is not a general display regarding posting of documents. in this case, when of the court 
 the court of appeals specifically did not address the mexican-american bar association speech. it focused only on the memorandum, correct?
what about a house and  and the use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house just because the police think, you know, it's possible this is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or something? is that all right?
this case was tried on the basis of the same transactions.
well, justice scalia 
leaving law out of it, which i'd like to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine you're a juror, and this is a totally contrived situation, which i think we're deciding  i don't know if there's ever been such a situation  but you're a juror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror, "the reason that we have these aggravating circumstances, which are hard to understand here, is, we want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking, somewhat more deserving of death, than the average." and then he says, "and the reason that we have these mitigating circumstances here is because every one of them means that he's somewhat less moral  he's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it reduces  it makes him less deserving of death, morally speaking." now, you're the juror, how do you feel about this?" and you say, "they're absolutely in balance, absolutely in balance. for every fact here on the aggravating side that puts me thinking, morally speaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a mitigating factor which makes me think, morally speaking, he's less deserving of death. so, i'm in perfect balance." and your fellow juror says, "now, will you please give me, then, one moral reason why he should be executed?" and what's your answer?
i understand that because they have the fobian rule.
well, the 
yes. they are claiming exclusive preemptive authority.
justice ginsburg, if i understand your question you're really talking about the underlying policy of a short statute of limitations driving certain types of 
in other words, you think  you think their  their, their rights  the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the child's?
i think 
but of course, there the legal standard was not clear. and the dura case, i looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you  what i have just heard, and i thought dura was a lack of proximate cause. they just didn't show any relation between the injury they alleged to have suffered, and their own.
i'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in  extradition is somebody who did somebody  something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. don't we have to have a treaty?
but the 
 your honor, i didn't write this treaty, and i  and i must say  [laughter.]
we know what happened and basically there's zero evidence.
how costly is that to the system other than getting the grand jury together?
two points, chief justice roberts. first is that our objection isn't to the bypass process. we believe that there would be  regardless of how good the procedures the new hampshire supreme court set up, there would still be inherent delay between the time a doctor diagnoses a patient and the time they get to court and get the order. so it's not a problem with the judicial bypass. the second question 
no, attorney for the debtor.
the  the united states hasn't taken a position on the broader argument about whether or not the 
it says that in the text, doesn't it, "clearly established by the supreme court"? is that not in the text of the statute?
or is that it?
 i think  tell me if i'm wrong about this particular record. i thought that the trial judge put it rather simply. he said, "there was an interrogation by a police officer named reese."
and he said, i know why they're here.
well, but let's  but the supposition is that the state legal judgment is that that's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate medical practice to make patients feel better, and morphine does that; and so, the state can allow them to prescribe morphine to make people feel better. and i understand your position to be that that would be permissible?
the record in the case shows that on those very instances where he was cited with trespass others who were doing the identical thing were not. and the ibla has said 
maybe we should take that into account, to some extent, that someone who participated on the bench had a different take on what her colleagues were saying?
so the mere fact that  that your county is exercising some, quote, core government functions, that  that doesn't  doesn't get you there.
i would think that you might. i mean, i think you could say  because i think what happened here is, all of this evidence came in on the back door through the insanity defense.
you bet you.
the record is confusing, at least as i read it  please correct me if i'm wrong  on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn. a, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons were worn?
thank you, mr. joseffer. mr. lamken, as i understand it, you have about 11 minutes left. you don't have to use them all. [laughter.]
so what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy. it's whether you get treble damages.
well, your honor, i think  we analogize it to the question of the substantive amount of benefits to which parents are entitled under the act. we think that this spending-clause legislation would allow a state to adopt a higher standard than the standard that this court established in rowley for free and appropriate public education, and that that would be the standard that would apply in a proceeding. and so, too, we think, with the question of the burden of proof. if states wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof for their own school districts in these proceedings, which this court has characterized as a substantive rule of law  the question of who bears the burden of proof  we think that states could do so, and that that would be the rule that applies. we don't quarrel with that.
well, constitutional error is 
let's assume they wasn't trespassing.
thank you, counsel. ms. higgins.
well, it may be that long. it may be a shorter period. but i think what we need to look at is not what we would think would be the preferred time frame, but what congress said was the preferred time frame. and congress is saying that it's one year, and the only time it's tolled is when the petitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust state remedies. that's again what this court said in duncan about describing this entire structure.
it seems to me that state tort law does not get at the harm that he has suffered. it gets at each individual piece. but the main harm he suffered is that they are circumventing the just compensation clause as the one way that the fifth amendment was designed to permit the government to get property for public use. thank you.
what page 
that's exactly right. i would have thought there's no competition because there are not two independent decision-makers.
the typical suggestive term, it was created to associate the high quality that my client markets in this product with that term, i want the "micro color" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by 
yes, your honor.
you can't say we want  we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other states. that's just contrary to the commerce clause.
and tell me if i'm right or wrong at each step. the offense that he was charged with  the capital offense that he was charged with was killing with or without intent in the course of committing a crime. is that correct?
and it was  about half as many whites as there were under the plan.
mr. olson, i don't mean to deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there was one point in your brief that was of concern to me. that is, you said that you questioned whether, assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would be appropriate to return this case to the court of appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the state court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle one to. and you said that would not be right.
the other part of your question about whether it was based on factual determinations could not have been based on factual determinations. instead, it was based on the prior state court determination that we did not state a claim  state a cause of action under california law for state compensation.
and presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight.
your honor, again, miller-el's claim of purposeful discrimination must focus on these six jurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these six jurors does show that these strikes were not based on race. this was not the tipping 
i don't know how this came about. i mean  i mean, i'm asking both sides the same question. it'll sound very favorable to you, but if you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to you, i might learn, later, i was wrong, and you won't have had a chance to answer. so, i want your honest opinion on this. i don't know how this happened. and i don't know  did you ask for en banc?
well, it would if they can only come here and  and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous. that's a  that's a very high standard.
but that's not a final agency action. the threat of another test isn't a final agency action, is it?
but there has to be some state  the state has to have created the risk somehow?
no we believe in this particular instance, particularly on, with the clarity under brunner, of the divestiture of the ninth circuit jurisdiction here. this is not a rule of force.
strong inference was not the test that was being applied in anderson, liberty lobby, in any of those cases.
and if there were regulations in the totten situation that created some sort of meaningful standard that would be applied by an internal procedure, which the record shows here the cia has an internal procedure, not just regulations setting out the standard, but a review process. we simply want to have a fair, internal procedure. this case really is not about the protection of state secrets, but the limits of the executive authority to unilaterally assert without any review by the court 
he can challenge the citations for challenging the  canceling the grazing permits 
for a practitioner, yes.
i gather there was some evidence or perhaps it's conceded that he was put on a suicide watch before his first trial. this was the second trial. right?
i would have thought that at the time this legislation was enacted, it would have been as unthinkable for a state to allow drugs to be used  to be prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be for drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient feel better.
well, i think that 
well, i  i would not necessarily agree that that goes beyond the jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant of  contained in 1334  1343 requires that  that jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color of state law. and that's an example which congress has done many times of putting qualifiers within a jurisdictional grant. an example of  of that we have  we attached 60 such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but a specific example, which i think is applicable here, is the uniformed service employee reemployment rights act wherein congress put in that the act would only apply jurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally, against employers. and then there's a subsequent definition of employer further on in  in the statute which is missing here because title 
which is what edwards is directed at.
yes. it's in somebody's home. it's into a home.
and it's only  the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked. when you're ranking it by pupils, maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your methodology would make sense.
 if the tax court judge so determines, yes. the rule certainly allows that, but it doesn't obviously require that.
your honor, there are  there is literally nothing in the statute except for the incidence provision, which is what the state relies on, that makes this a tax on receipt. and, if i could, in central 
 but  and it totally makes my case, as far as i'm concerned.
and what's the reason for requiring a clear connection?
the initial offense was speeding, and mr. harris, instead of pulling over or slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly. we would contend that it was mr. harris that was in control of the force that the officers need to terminate, the risk that he presented. at any time, any time, mr. harris could have either slowed down his vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.
i  i don't think it's  your honor, i feel duty-bound to say there are no bad hypotheticals, but there are  there are easy ones, and i think if  if it's a known officer  it's  in that situation, it's going to be accusatorial. if it's not a known officer, it's  it's not accusatorial 
well, what's the objection to, whenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in the corner, and it says, "this advertisement is paid for by the beef industry under a regulation, x-23, of the department of agriculture"?
yes, you could charge under 371. there's nothing that prevents the government from doing so. this court has  has held before, for example, in the batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions that essentially cover the same conduct, and the government has discretion to choose which one to use. generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy statute contains higher penalties. so the practice today is  is to prosecute those offenses under section 1956(h). another  another reading there  another reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision should be rejected is that congress modeled section 1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a freestanding criminal offense.
it's wrong because there is no logical connection to taking something away under the facts of this case when taking away an entire litany of  or a very broad spectrum of things which  in the special management units, where these inmates came from, they had had magazines taken away on their first phase in the special management units. they had been offered the incentive of earning access to magazines, of earning access to weekly visits with family members, of earning access to telephone calls, in fact, of earning access for release from their cells the 23 hours a day to engage in  in small group activities with other inmates. and most spectacular was they had the opportunity, while in the special management unit, to earn a 3- to 6-month probationary period in a general population cell block.
mr. fisher tells us that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes through the elements of the crime in a very structured way.
 before you tell me what the consequence is.
it would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants i'm saying.
may i interrupt with one 
but washington  at a minimum, i would assume that the washington supreme court would not have constitutional avoidance as a crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, because there is no constitutional issue here under your view.
well, but  but this is all subject challenge as an abuse of discretion.
absolutely. and 
well, your honor, if you're talking about the distinction between the procedural and the substance in the act, congress made clear 
but if it's owned by the state of new york, if it's been acquired somehow by the state, then what?
well, the texas study doesn't  doesn't apply to the initial intake process.
right. it 
there's also a redressability problem, too, isn't there? i mean, assuming they could, is there any  would action against the assembly eliminate their tax?
for a brief period of time, they sat in  in panels.
well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship? is that the context in which we've articulated that rule?
you said, you know, convict what's  or hang what's his name. that's quite  you're equating that with the buttons in this case. and i don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and so, or even convict so and so. they just say we have been deprived of a loved one. this is a terrible matter. please, jury, consider this case carefully. that's all it necessarily says.
mr. schwartz. excuse me. mr. schwartz.
the pivot rotates?
well, but 
well, the court said  the act says it in  in section (h)(1)(j). that's the  the  in the appendix to the blue brief on page 5. the act excludes time while the proceeding is  is going on for examinations and hearings, et cetera, but at the end, it excludes only delay reasonably attributable to any period not to exceed 30 days during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court. so  so if the 
then you would expect at least a cross reference to 371 for defining the conspiracy, but there's nothing here.
what about the other part? because i think the solicitor general  i hope, i don't want to put words in his mouth  but i think he agrees that brown held out the promise of an equal education, that the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get a degree of integration, and that maintaining it is important. i think the government agrees with that. they think this case goes too far. and in that i think he's referring to narrow tailoring. it isn't narrowly tailored enough. so i would appreciate knowing why you think it is.
and says of course you're china. and then it signs a remand order.
this court has always treated as the same the custody of an alien who arrives at the border and has not been admitted, whether that person stays on the boat, goes to ellis island, which the court said was not an entry that gave somebody constitutional rights to come here. in the kaplan v. tod case, you had the example of a person who was paroled for 9 years and regarded as not being in the united states. and what the 
we cite 
 actually completely 
the  it's a matter of economics, justice ginsburg, just as your question suggests. the tribe would not  would like to be able to market tax-free fuel at its non-regulated casino. it would  probably would like  and if this case is decided against the state, it would probably not like to pay the tax on the  on the car that brings the patron 
the better 
but you seem to give the fact that it's listed in schedule 1 zero weight. it seems to me, at the very least, there should be a presumption that this is a compelling interest.
it seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a federal district court judge. the magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation. what's the difference between those two?
what is your main objection to  i mean, it's hard to propose a rule of reason. why, why can't the rule of reason work to promote the objectives you've just articulated?
that  well, again, just last  this isn't  this isn't quite the same context. but just this  just last term in the cheney case, this court recognized the limitations on prosecutors. and in atwater v. city of lago vista, in determining the scope of the fourth amendment and the capacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this court recognized that not all checks have to come from the courts. they can come from the political process here. and it's very important to keep in mind that these hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that. purely hypothesized. this has been on the books for almost 40 years.
i guess there's a difference here between the interest of a small party and a large one. a small party would like, if there is a deadline, to be as close to the election as possible so voters have a chance to get fed up with the two big parties. (laughter.)
and  and the agency comes in and says, prove that you're a pl-110 resettlee.
with the court's permission, i'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
no.
 i thought, with respect to justice ginsburg's colloquy  and my own, earlier  that we said that there is an offset obligation, even if they're different claims.
why would the doctors in that case propose that option to their patients?
an idea or a principle, two plus two equals four can't be patented. it has to be put together with a machine and made into a usable device. the bind that at&t is in here is that the components that make the machines run that are produced abroad are not supplied from the united states. they are made in belgium or frankfurt or something.
well, that's the point.
and if that's true  and the reason for that i suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.
but, as  i understand the treaty. what the treaty says is, you can't import substances listed in schedule 1. then you look at schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.
i agree.
or loss.
 provision.
you misinterpreted my letter. it was not an acceptance.
do you agree with mr. frederick's answer about title ii of the civil rights act of 1964? i mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.
thank you, counsel. mr. stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.
yes.
but i think the better view, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not that there's something wrong with the recipient, but that there's something wrong with what goes on at these conferences. then in that context, i don't think there would be  standing 
in the complaint that they failed to do it. that is undisputed. the  the defendant concedes it. the government concedes it. what was disputed was that there's a different statute 
or want to impose a higher tax.
correct, your honor, because there wouldn't  this statute wouldn't have been written to take that into account. this 
here it was 
if those direct federal cases were interpreting the constitutional provisions directly, they would count as established law?
well, first of all, make-whole i think is best  there are a variety of make-whole rules in addition to those that mr. coleman mentioned. there's rules where you prorate the settlement in certain ways so that you get some proportion. but the basic make-whole rule, as has been described by the courts of appeals, is a default rule and that is where you're just relying on a pure subrogation clause or you don't mention it all in a particular insurance document, then some courts have said you apply some kind of make-whole rule or some other allocation rule to figure out how much of the tort recovery goes to the insurer.
he'd changed the hypo.
what damages would you get for the trespass of a  one, one blm agent on your land? a lot of money you're going to get for that? would it, would it come anywhere close to reimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to go, to go all the way through the litigation?
yes.
you couldn't rely on the past history in that situation?
well, if that's  if there is some likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess, it seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here when it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals.
can you help me with 
is that your position?
well, first, there's no authority that i'm aware of that would require any type of a specific colloquy. i think this record 
in the reception centers, no. the  it has been a policy of not cross-racially housing the inmates in the cells only. that's correct, your honor.
well, mr. feldman 
that's correct, justice breyer. and that illustrates the very problem with this case, which is that in cases where there is 90 days, 2 months, 4 months, the very difficult questions that a federal court would normally look to state law, if it was determinant, to apply, california is giving no guidance. and our case falls within that once you look to the particular explanations that our client put forward. and so, we would suggest that if there is a concern on the part of the court about certain cases getting through and essentially allowing prisoners to abuse the writ, that this court will use its equitable discretion to look at individual cases and to decide, "hey, is this a situation where the behavior is dilatory? is this a situation where the behavior is abusive?" and that would restrict the number of cases where federal courts would need to engage in a factual inquiry. the alternative is adopting a presumption, that the attorney general suggested, that the california courts have flatly rejected. that presumption has been adopted  has been imported from the direct-appeal context. it has no significance in california habeas law. in the direct-appeal context, prisoners have the right to counsel. in the habeas context, they don't, except in capital cases. and, unsurprisingly  pardon me  unsurprisingly, the california supreme court has adopted a presumption of 90 days, in the capital context. so, in the  in the noncapital cases, like my client's, where individuals have no incentive to delay  my client has been up for parole twice already, he has no incentive to delay the habeas process  and where people like mr. chavis think that they're, in good faith, complying  and it's not just an issue of excuse  and this goes back to a  to a question that justice o'connor asked earlier  there are specific policy reasons why the state of california has adopted the standard that it has. they've articulated 
well, that doesn't carry too much weight, though, because the provision that  i'm looking at (g)(3), "violates any state law relating to any controlled substance," can be broader than what's punishable under the federal controlled substances 
are you saying  because this can get pretty complex  simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went  what the court is instructing is double counting that factor? it's a factor in all the circumstances how the  how the crime was committed is a factor of all circumstances; and then, in addition, it is a special circumstance. so it is, in effect, counted twice. is that the essence of your argument?
i think she is saying that we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas, so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than just the individual claims, which is what i think you want; isn't it?
your honor 
so presumably you're not looking forward to further 
well, your  your honor, in response 11 to that, i would say this. it's clear from the testimony 12 of counsel in the state post-conviction proceedings that 13 they had interviewed their client in great detail about 14 his prior conviction, that they were aware of what had  15 what it had involved.
well, but  habeas corpus generally doesn't give a right to a pre-enforcement challenge. and this court, for example, in schlesinger against councilman 
you know the argument. it's a very familiar argument.
well, may 
and what the chief justice says was true in bradshaw and in edwards and in elstad.
well, but it could be on the  on the party because 
so it seems to me it's like joining a school trip at the zoo, you know. you  you don't make it to the  to the school, but you drive there yourself and then join the class as it's going through the zoo. it seems to me he's in school.
but, mr. goldstein, there's another aspect that troubles me. your view, as i understand, only applies while the ship is in american waters so that if, for example, you complain about the training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be  there would be no violation of the  the statue. would there?
they might have been lying about that 
well, i thought that was  i thought that was to determine if there were outstanding orders and warrants against the individual.
i mean, but that's always true. you could have a  you could have a  a sheet that shows: admitted, assault, you know. and  and what the sheet says, it says: charge, assault; plea, guilty. it's possible, for all we know, that when the actual colloquy took place, he was talking about some other thing. i don't know what he was talking about, but what you'd go upon is that there was a charge and he pleaded guilty to the charge.
in our case, the first 15 months 
one is  is 
 but it's not an application, it's an application for our review, not state post-conviction review.
what's the answer?
is "reasonable time" the issue, or is it what california would consider a "reasonable time"? i mean, that's the problem.
you say that would be this case.
the federal government says you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 billion.
the  the 
your honor, when congress enacted the federal food, drug and cosmetic act and did not provide a federal cause of action for it and yet laid out federal standards of conduct for labeling of drugs like bendectin in that case, congress must have understood that without it creating a federal private right of action, the states  the state product liability law, state inadequate warning law would subsume claims 
if your honor  if your honor's fact situation includes a presumption that that's going to be the presumed method, i think at that point, yes 
is that correct, or incorrect?
the government's view is that there's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have  you would have to consider each case on its terms. and it's not clear, from this court's cases, where the policies in that 
well, they knew right away.
well, that's all very good, but 
well, neither of the major parties has done that in oklahoma, has it?
no. i'm talking about only the evidence that  that was the product of the search conducted after the warrant was delivered.
we brought the lawsuit and we 
you didn't have a chance to answer justice breyer's question about primary jurisdiction. let's get the sec's views first of whether there is any interference with securities law enforcement.
well, that's one of the issues, and i'm trying to understand. the respondent's position is that the arkansas law goes beyond what the medicaid assignment provisions require. and i want your position on whether or not, if that's right, again without regard to the anti-lien provision, that you would lose. it seems to me that you can  arkansas can go beyond what the medicaid law requires for reimbursement, if it wants.
but the difference between that case and this is that the allegation with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not present here. here the allegation simply is parallel conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in. and at that general level the answer is, of course anyone in his right mind would want to make it difficult to let the upstarts in. there's no need to assume that they might have agreed on some matter of detail which is not essential to the scheme. this is a general characteristic of competition and resistance of competition.
in those cases, would the government ever on its own motion have a defendant retried or released? has that ever happened?
i'm trying to get a handle on it. as i understood the case that came, i don't think there's disagreement on either side about how conflict preemption works. but i thought your position was that more is involved here and that the state can't regulate it at all, and you're not getting into a conflict preemption question. it's just if it's a state regulation it can't 
is it concurrent? i mean, the  the statute i'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the united states as a necessary party defendant. is that what happened here? they were joined as a necessary party defendant?
and i suppose that's  that's the complaint. if there was a procedure in place, we could address it. if florida reserves to itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's  we want to be told what it will be in our particular case so we have a target that we can aim at.
well, i think, your honor, first of all, in determining plain error, it's necessary to put it in the context of this case, where that very issue had been raised repeatedly and had, in fact, been ruled on by the court in denying the summary judgment motion. so, we weren't dealing with someone who was naive in this respect. we were dealing with someone who had faced this precise issue, and the very closely related issue of antitrust standing, which focuses on antitrust injury. so, we got to this point in the trial. we had a great deal of history 
which state has one school district?
it depends, of course, on whether you  what you're doing. now i see what you're doing. you're applying a kind of palsgraf causation analysis within the risk  i think that's what you're doing  to saying it's outside, it's not a cause. you're saying  you don't say it's not a necessary condition of his being there. it is. you do say, "well, the being-in-the-room-there is not within the risk, the reason for which we have a knock-and-announce rule." but, of course, that's a matter of judgment. i mean, you could say the purpose of the cause  of the knock-and-announce rule is to keep people out of there without knocking and announcing. and if that's the purpose of it, it's right within the risk, right cause.
of course, what you're asking us to do would  would just solve your problem in this case, and  and in the future, i suppose they could revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. there  there's nothing in the statute that requires this report, is there?
 why don't you just go and ask the ninth circuit to say, "look, this is not  read the opinion, read what they said. correct it."
of course, none of this would have been sufficient if we were talking about your  your client, the irs. they do far more extensive effort to find the individual before they sell property for delinquent taxes.
right, but it wasn't when these claims were decided. and that's where i think sims v. apfel comes into play. under justice thomas' plurality opinion, the key is looking at kind of the nature of the proceedings and if it's informal and accusatorial as opposed to adversarial, then a court cannot impose a requirement beyond that which the agency itself required at the time that the claims were before the agency. under justice o'connor's concurrence, she was concerned about fair notice, and certainly here in these cases petitioners williams and walton didn't have fair notice that a year and a half later the state of michigan, after going through the entire grievance procedure and never relying on their failure to be sufficiently specific, can then come into federal court and say, aha 
well, what they paid happens to be the market price, but  but you can't really say that the ninth circuit was referring to the market price as part of its  its damages. its damages are what they paid. whether that  if they paid above market, it would be the same.
well, i would 
well, the defendant 
well, the 
yes, justice ginsburg; but as practical matter, with the resolution of this case by this court we would certainly have to start the process, whatever ruling this court finds, all over again. we certainly cannot participate in the action in china because that has already gone on. we would have the option to participate in the case in the united states because those specific issues were not litigated in china.
 of the issues is whether he's done that here 
well, he lives in arkansas, but that doesn't make this his homestead.
excuse me, your honor?
all right. if  then if that's fair, is it fair also for us to say that  that we have to take this treaty, since it's self-executing, as if it were written into american law?
well, the warrant is obtained based on an affidavit by 
well, this court has said so many times, and powers v. ohio, for example, noted the impediment to the 
yes.
per hearing 
but isn't that true of all injunctive orders, they're not issued to the police. and yet the police  don't the police have an obligation to enforce that?
suppose you ask the judge. you say, judge, 2 months ago the defendant came to you and said, i waive the speedy trial act. now the defendant says, judge, i now would like a month's continuance. the judge says, i'll give it to you. the opposing counsel says why. he says, because he waived it. now, you're telling me that, one, he cannot waive it, but two, even though the judge said i did it because he waived it, that still itself is okay. we go ahead and let him exclude it because the judge might have done something differently. is that what you're saying?
it's not in your joint appendix here?
well, first, it's optional, not mandatory. if they want to keep them, they 
i agree. and i don't quarrel at all with the way that the court described  said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the o'neal case, that it doesn't fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. i don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to mr. fry to make the sufficient showing 
but there wasn't much evidence against him other than the forensic evidence. isn't that right? there's just some people who saw him nearby.
but it  it might have been that prior to dabit, you would have been emphasizing  or whoever would have been emphasizing the  the fraud character of  of the claims, and after dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only one left for you.
okay, if this is in a  in the course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by section 1512. if it is in advance of a proceeding  and let's assume that you know that a proceeding 
the  yes, your honor.
and  and the problem with section  with district 23, under section 2 of the voting rights act, is not the motivation. it's the results that have changed. isn't that correct?
are there other areas in the law where courts have to take as binding a legal proposition that they think is dead wrong when they 
as awful as it might be 
well, it's already a small percentage of the totality, because cases of this type, which involve speech by a public employee while they're doing their job, however that is formulated, are already a small subset of the universe of public employee 
well, no. i  i don't think that is the case, justice kennedy, because in  in  summers doesn't authorize what they did. graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a  on a fourth amendment analysis. and franklin v. foxworth, which is a ninth circuit case that happened before this case, the court, first of all, used the  the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on summers and graham to decide that a particular summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.
there must be an inference of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn from circumstantial evidence, and that's what matsushita is all about.
ms. hart, i'm  i'm not sure what you mean by  that there has to be probable cause for arrest. do you mean objectively, or do you mean on the basis of the facts known to the arresting officer? i mean, let's  let's assume an officer stops a car for a broken taillight, and it turns out the car doesn't have a broken taillight. all right? so that basis is wrong. however, the car also has an expired inspection sticker, which the officer didn't know about. was there a probable cause for arrest, as you're using the term here?
well, but, again, in rust, the doctor who spoke  i think the patient who went to see the doctor for counseling would have  would have assumed or believed that the doctor was  in the immediate encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the court, in its subsequent cases, has regarded rust as a situation of government speech. but the important point about what you've just asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the statute or the beef order. neither the act nor the order requires that in the advertising. and if the court was to perceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be to invalidate the act, but to, instead, provide that there should be some different identification 
well, i don't think that's at all as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by the united states for the reason that justice breyer just explained. congress might want to have one 6-year limitation and say, well, maybe there would be this hypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the most part, 6 years will take care of everybody.
 as an implication from the statute?
and do  do other prison systems adopt similar policies to try to keep the races mixed generally in 
no. i meant the state workmen's comp law.
in the district court i thought he said that.
justice ginsburg, part of the issue here is  is the lack of consent. mr. nixon was not present during the entire guilt phase of the trial. what we would submit is that in this case where there was the hearing in a holding cell  it was on the record. it's part of the record before your honor  where the judge inquired about mr. nixon's willingness to participate in his trial, and he declined to go into the courtroom, that refusal to go into the courtroom, we submit, was a refusal to attend the  the hearing on the presumption that he was going to have a trial consistent with his guilty plea  or not guilty plea  excuse me  the not guilty plea that was entered. what he anticipated was a trial where the state's case was  was tested and it was consistent with his not guilty plea.
right.
indeed.
so bigbee  bigbee was explaining what he meant when he wrote inc.
but if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad.
i don't think that would constitute an extension. i think the language in subsection (b) requires some 
i 
yes, but that simply means that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this case than merely talking to his supervisor. and  and the  the issue  maybe  maybe we're missing it, but the issue is why isn't there a very good reason to require him to go through the grievance procedure, number one, to  to cut down on needless federal court actions and, number two, under the  sort of the general policy of favoring what collective bargaining agreements negotiate.
are they likely to do that? is this a real problem?
so i don't know why you give that one away.
let me modify the question. do you agree that if they're correct, the entire action has to be dismissed?
it may have, but what they did not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist even though he had no criminal history. he had been previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. he had admitted that this was not  the occasion of his arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal crack. he'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. and the judge essentially turned all of those facts off. she did not really factor that into her sentence at all. and the court of appeals, although it may have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had treated him as, the record does indeed support the court of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant, despite his criminal history, really looks more like a recidivist. and when you're talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5 years, but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a first-time offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history. and the judge basically said: i'm going to take a chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than what the guidelines described. our view is the judge can look at the facts she looked at, but she went down to a level that is productive of unwarranted disparity.
well, what if the only question  what if a 911 caller says nothing more than, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me, send a police officer right away to make the person stop attacking me? is that testimonial?
this is an unusual case in the way that it's set out in judge suhrheinrich's opinion, your honor. but if you look at it and  and look at it in the way that  that it should have played out  and the way it should have played out was that the mandate should have issued after this court denied cert. this court then went on after that to deny rehearing and the state moved forward. if at that point judge suhrheinrich looked at this deposition and believed that it established or showed an extraordinary circumstance, than a recall would  would have occurred, and then that would have been an issue. but if you look at the evidence itself, it simply does not rise to the level of  of extraordinary circumstances. it does not show actual innocence of the offense. gregory thompson has all along admitted that he committed this offense. there was no defense of it at trial.
okay, but it is not final 
what about the  what about the full sweep argument? let's sort of come full circle on that. you  you say the full sweep argument is no good because the same thing could have been made in mcculloch. the response was there is a textual difference 
but if this case were limited to postviability abortions it would be a different matter. but isn't it so that the vast majority of these abortions are going to be performed previability?
no. the basis for my answer is two levels of no problem. there's not a problem as to the single deal and there's not a problem as to saying you have to hold the stock. that's not at issue. we have no problem with that. what's always been prohibited is to create pools of orders to drive up the price of the stock. if you work to raise the price of the stock, which this was all geared to do, after it came public, it drives prices to unsustainable levels. it creates a lot of action in the stock. people come in and buy. our clients buy directly from the defendants who are driving the stock up. and yes, there was no disclosure. as with any antitrust conspiracy, if there was disclosure there could have been 
i'm 
what of a small landowner?
so, what's the definition  - what's the general definition that you're giving us that describes this result you've given?
he does  he does not have a  he does not have a first amendment claim in those circumstances where there is probable cause for the violation. the 
is that fair?
if you get a second bite, why shouldn't you get a first bite? i mean, i  i don't see  i don't see any reason for treating preferentially the  the person who files in state court but does not file new claims, which he should have known to file at that time, and treating the person who comes to the federal court with those new claims but doesn't have  doesn't have even one that he took to state court. i  i don't see any reason to be merciful to one and not the other.
like  what it is it? you have to go back to the 15th century or the 16th? is there  is there a case? there must have been cases like that.
it could be an affirmative defense.
again, your honor, it's not that we couldn't potentially win these cases under least restrictive alternative. the question is by changing the standard to that, changing the standard to one in which these prison officials  i mean, congress is, in a sense, asking federal judges to sit as overseers of religious life in the prisons across the 50 states. and given what this court said in turner, given what this court said in o'lone about the intractable problems that prison officials face, it just seems an inappropriate task and one that, if motivated with the desire of increasing religiosity in prison, seems to cross the establishment 
no, no, no.
respectfully, justice ginsburg, it's unfortunately more complicated than that. if the first question in the jones case, the id pleading rule question, is resolved in favor of petitioner jones, then total exhaustion is a live issue. because the sixth circuit as an alternative holding justified the dismissal of jones's complaint on the total exhaustion ground. and i guess on the other side if the court were to resolve the identifying the defendant's issue against petitioner 
well, but congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court. and there are a lot of entry qualifications. in diversity cases, you  if you allege diversity, and it existed at the outset, that's fine. that doesn't have to be proved at the end of the case. indeed even if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly there. congress can establish entry requirements even when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.
he is the witness 
let me just say, on the attorney- ineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point what the government's view is, because the claims are completely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit whether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to show procedural default, he's going to have to show attorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything additional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't matter which claim he asserts first. but the reason why amendment occurs all the time is because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts such that if he raises a miranda claim or a strickland claim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege prejudice under strickland, he can amend, after the one-year period. and also 
why does his motive matter? i mean, the  the issue is whether she is testifying, whether she is a witness, and i don't see how that changes when she tells him these things orally and when she signs the affidavit afterwards. it seems to me she's testifying as to what events had occurred.
but the  the court of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you were an arm of the state.
thank you, mr. coleman. mr. feldman.
 then you might persuade me.
yes, your honor.
well 
i mean, what i  to sort of my cards on the  i was thinking, "well, that comes close," but maybe it  maybe it is within the  within the  within the exception. i'm not sure. and then 
yes, mr. chief justice. under section 2's question with respect to racially polarized voting, we would contend that voting as a bloc 70 percent or subsequently higher than 70 percent to 90-92 percent is enough under section 2 to satisfy the test whether latinos are voting cohesively. congressman bonilla has never been able to garner a majority of latino support, not more than 30 percent. but with respect to a somewhat different question, which is whether partisanship and race correlate so highly in district 23, that you can remove latinos and in the hopes of being able to take the democratic index down, we say that that kind of voting is not tight enough. in easley v. cromartie, of course, the court found that african american voters voted 95 to 97 percent for democratic candidates across elections.
but then the question is whether or not it's in navigation at the time of the accident.
they would have to file an answer and motion to dismiss raising whatever affirmative defense they want to raise, but at least it gives them a choice and gives them the opportunity to frame this argument as opposed to putting it on, putting that burden on the court. moreover if the court were to adopt respondents' reading of the screening provisions, those screening provisions would swallow up every single affirmative defense enumerated in the federal rules, and also those not enumerated.
yes.
but the  but the problem with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500, the titan 6500 product specifically, in that context, the report is, there's nothing in there that says what those reports say about the 6500. and remember, this is a case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers inside the company who could provide you with all of the detail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell you what was in the 6500 report that would  that would suggest that it's not available, there's not word one in the allegation.
but  but if  if your  if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to any racial group that could influence an  an election, i don't see the limits on your principle.
even apart from the  what  the lack of evidence for any change since the reyes decision, do we have any empirical evidence, perhaps involving a control group, about the likelihood of the  this liberal search policy in reducing recidivism?
but there is no statute, no regulation. that means the executive can do what it will. there's nothing that binds them to the way it was done in sims' case.
and it is that determination that you are objecting to here. the harmlessness determination.
i couldn't agree more, your honor. i think it's very clearly settled by tennard and other cases going back to 1976 that facts like a deprived or abused background or mental impairment are certainly mitigating. and with further response to your 
i haven't made it.
no.
were any of these administrative actions found to be unfounded? in other words, did he win any of the trespass citations?
the  the oregon question.
their response 
well, that  that isn't the issue before us here. i  i assume that for purposes of the question on which we granted certiorari, we have to assume, or else the whole thing doesn't make any sense and it's all  it's all arguing about nothing  we have to assume that there was probable cause on some other ground than the ground which he stated or anything closely related to the ground which  which the officer stated. isn't that  isn't that the  the manner in which this case gets to us?
yes. then the  the answer would be yes. and if you look at  if you look at the competitor cases, what i call the competitor cases, there's a very discrete body of law we're talking about. they're cited in our brief. there's fewer than a dozen cases around the country from the circuit and district courts. and what they show is that there's only three ways you  there's only several ways you can do this. you can  you can make a misrepresentation to a regulator or to a customer. we have those cases. you can bribe a customer or a regulator, or you can engage in violence directed at a  at a regulator or at a customer. there's only three variations.
well, i know, but what 
well, you say without consent. at least as  the record that we have suggests that the client was told this is what the lawyer planned to do and said nothing. justice scalia asked a question when the prior argument was ongoing. when a client doesn't say yes and he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song, mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do? because if he says, okay, i'm going to  i'm going to require a full-stop trial, i'm going to cross examine every witness, he may be damaging his client. the client didn't tell him not to do that any more than he told him to do it. so mustn't the lawyer in that situation exercise his best judgment?
no, no. what you're saying is the language.
your honor, i think the term "use" is the distributor's use. the scheme that kansas has set up is a sensible one. it is, the distributor gets the tax and then has three choices. it can use it, sell it, or deliver it. and if the distributor  if the distributor is  hasn't done one of those things, then it's  then it  then the distributor can be made liable for any tax increases that have  that happen while the distributor is holding the tax. and so, in our view, and in every court that we're aware of's view  tenth circuit didn't decide this case on the assumption that this was a tax on receipt of fuel off the reservation. what the tenth circuit said was that kansas is now attempting to collect its tax for the first time, a tax on motor fuel distributed to indian lands. it is, again, the same thing 
 in a military commission.
i could live with that rule.
and candidly, most of the licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're  i'm sorry, justice kennedy.
it can be, or it might not be. if you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. but if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market  it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market 
well, justice stevens, i'm 
well, justice o'connor had asked you about the  the quiet title cases, but kansas city title & trust is still good law. it wasn't overruled.
i really don't understand the  are you sure that a failure to execute a statute does not come within the language, "an act or omission," in the execution of a statute? i would think a total failure to execute is an omission in the execution of the statute.
yes.
this is an act, justice scalia, where the sec's enforcement authority isn't affected one jot. and so, i think it would be a strange application of chevron, or even skidmore, deference to say that the sec gets some special weight because it's construing words in an enactment 
your honor, you're correct. what our position is is that they did not meet the standard that they should have been able to meet for a facial challenge, which would grant as-applied relief which would only be invalid in that one potential application. if i may reserve the rest of my time, with all due respect.
but the factor  if i understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers, it was rather because they had lesser years of service than the more senior officers.
and that's the virtue of their standard.
are you arguing now then that there may be no limits on expenditures?
i thought there was 
we believe that the courts of appeals have already resolved that question, and that is that  first of all, there are  there are variations on make-whole. theirs is only one. their view of it is only one, which is the  the most 
yes.
and what is that argument?
general cruz, could i ask you another district-specific question? because i want to get it on the table and let you explain it to me. focusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the moment  and i  i know you probably disagree with this but  that the results of the redrawing of district 23 violated section 2, would you say that it would be a defense to that violation that the motivation was actually non-racial but purely political?
well, then all the  but all you're saying  but you have to do business in the state with the lower income tax rate to get the advantage of the lower rate.
yes, your honor, we would say that 
fair enough, your honor. then with respect to the second part of my answer to your question, justice souter, that it cannot be both final for 1257 purposes and pending 
justice scalia, that is not the point of these bar associations' either. these bar associations, including the american bar association, the american intellectual property law association, have lawyers on both sides of all these cases. they're looking for a test that has balance and that is what the federal circuit has done. now, let me just say 
of course, in avoiding that chill, you're in effect saying the prosecutor is entitled to one or two free discriminatory challenges.
she stated in her answers to interrogatories that she may very well not have interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize marijuana. under our theory, we think she could have interfered with that because it was disruptive to the event, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the 
that's right. that's right. and because there is no appeal as of right under michigan law, this  the douglas case doesn't govern the disposition. ultimately the  the controlling is ross. and the issue then is whether michigan provides a meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to bring an application for leave. that's really the  i think the heart of the constitutional issue. there are three distinct characteristics of the michigan system. the  the nature of the review is discretionary, and i think comparable to the kind of review in ross that was described by this court for the north carolina supreme court. mr. moran makes a claim that the michigan court of appeals is an error-correcting court. with regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court. in fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in michigan, the reason the michigan constitution was changed was because of the heavy volume that the michigan court of appeals was facing. there are 28 judges in the michigan court of appeals, and they produce 
he's  he's still a 
he should deny conversion.
and i agree with you, your honor, except it is the only indication in the record that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an opinion on this. if you read the brief by the solicitor general, the government would have us think that every single case is going to involve foreign nations and delicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors. very clearly, there is no such evidence in the record and the only evidence we do have is from another sovereign, china, that says if you have a u.s. cause of action we have no problem if a u.s. court adjudicates it on the merits. having said that, the issue here was whether or not personal jurisdiction should have been decided before the forum non conveniens. and again, we would just go back to our second point, where the court believes that it can't evaluate a doctrine without having  if it's a required factor of the doctrine that a sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to presuppose personal jurisdiction.
did he 
well, your honor, it is certainly a common practice that, while the 
first of all, the geysers are not included because we're talking about navigable 
ms. nield, is  is the state making a harmless error argument here? i really couldn't tell from your brief whether you're doing it or not. are  are  is the state asserting that assuming it  assuming it was wrong, assuming it was a violation, this jury would have  would have come out the same way anyway?
the court has never treated article iii standing that way, mr. chief justice. the court has said, "a standing is not dispensed in gross"  that was the lewis versus casey case  that standing has to looked at  be looked at individually with respect to the claim. furthermore, this  there was not an identical nucleus of facts. i mean, it is the  the property tax exemption was issued pursuant to a contract between the company here, daimlerchrysler, and the city of toledo. the state tax 
that's right. and i think, justice ginsburg, you've done a better job of articulating a justification for the sentence than the judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family separation and employment to the degree that you have now articulated it. what the judge did was focus on the quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't have any criminal history and that he qualified for the safety valve. she also said, without specifying any other cases, that other cases that have come before my court have had  you know  perhaps larger quantity of drugs and very different sentences. when a court of appeals is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we know anything, for example, about what this judge is saying about other cases with other drug quantities? there's no specifics in the record that enable the court of appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of that observation. it's also relevant for the court of appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken into account all of the factors that this judge has previously noted and what has happened in the sentence is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence for reasons that the commission already took into account. now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from relying on those facts, but it does mean that the farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.
i thought that was 
this is not  not issue preclusion. i mean, this is  that is  the defendant who stands silent is going to lose.
what is the 
and if the only  if the only interest in uniformity we have, again, is whether the  whether the federal government gets its  its money back, then  you know, then the uniformity argument may fly. but if we're also interested in the  in the uniformity argument in the manner in which federal employees are treated and in the manner in which ladies who  such as denise finn are treated, then uniformity is  is out the window under these  under this 
 that's a fine characterization, but i'm not sure that that helps us. in connick, the one subject of the speech that was held to be protected was the speech questioning political pressure to help in campaigns and so on. the issue here that would arguably favor protection is the issue of calling public attention to lying by police officers in criminal cases. and it seems to me that the  that if there's a public interest in political pressure, there's a public interest in mendacity in law enforcement.
 "i would other have to pay." and the other side will  or  i was a thousand dollars, i meant 42 billion, okay? [laughter.]
the california supreme court may  might well hold that it's arbitrary to conduct such an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to  - i don't know 
so that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?
the first one was on the statute of limitations?
patents can be valuable, but not confer meaningful, significant market power. what this court said in jefferson parish is significant market power. i mean, there can be lots of circumstances in which a competitor has the ability for some customers in some circumstances to raise price to some extent, but we wouldn't consider that significant market power. and patents can confer value in other ways. for instance, in many high-tech industries in the modern high-tech environment, a patent library is necessary merely in order to get cross licenses from your competitors that would allow each of you to compete. they're fully competitive markets, but without a patent library, you can't get in the door. and all the competitors have their patent libraries and they agree to cross licenses to avoid the  the inconvenience and cost of patent infringement.
right, and the question is whether the state is free in that circumstance to apply a state harmless error standard or if it has to be required to apply a federal harmless error standard. and our  and the fact is that on the ground the states are routinely applying state harmless error standards in those situations. and so it would be a sea change if this court were to now hold that, no, when a state court is reviewing the effect of a federal error that the state court has to apply a federal standard rather than the state.
how many tests did he have?
unless you take the view that penry took, which is you have to let the jury distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that don't tie in at all to dangerousness.
your honor, we could. we have a number of classes of rivers. with respect to one class, that is not a designated use. with respect to all the others, hydropower is the designated use.
but yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their  to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring  bring a lawsuit?
it's a trick they play on new chief justices all the time. [laughter.]
why should all of that make a difference? you make a big point in the briefing, "well, you're not marketing the exemption, you're taxing, you're using"  if the  if the tribe does have the sovereign right to tax or not to tax, why can't it use it not to tax at all and say, "we're giving"  why is there a presumption in favor of imposing taxes? why can't the tribe say, "we're not going to tax you if you come to the reservation. come on in and buy our gas. no tax"?
and i think that that language is 
supreme court? yes, that's probably pretty clear it's federal.
thank you, mr. stewart. mr. digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.
but what about audits for revenue 
 was the concession you made in response to my 
yes, ma'am. well, but  but again, it goes  goes back to  but would that include retaliation? and  and 
right, and what was 
no, no. i assumed there's 
but the trouble with the principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have said that even if the district court has come to an erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, that is not appealable.
actually my understanding is that much of it was written by the attorney general in california at the time.
absolutely  absolutely not, justice kennedy. we recognize 
all right. now, why is that a conflict? let's imagine  it sounds like a conflict. but it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered. i mean, why is that a conflict? there are lots of specific situations. if i read that, i would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.
i would think that it's easier in  you know, we had  we had a  this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and  and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the  the lack of  of mental capacity to  to have that mens rea. this is the same thing you're arguing before us. and  and it seems to me that if it applies to duress, it applies even  even more strongly to  to insanity. how can an insane person form the intent to commit a crime that  that requires mens rea?
i suppose employees have been under the rule for a long time.
and the time limit could have expired before the act occurs. right? so you get free retaliation after 6 years. is that right?
 but you're  all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.
no, not if you're talking about corporate powers, because those are governed by state law. what it could do, though, is regulate the subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out functions that the national bank itself could perform.
no, but justice scalia says it always does because it benefits the locality.
 of the need for this, because it's the other thing that's on my mind. the two words that came into my mind are "spousal abuse." all right? i would say maybe there's a pretty good need for this. the husband's beating her up. and there isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the kitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd, and they call the police. "we'd better look into it." they come to the door. she says, "um, hmmm, oh, i'd like, officer, for you to just come upstairs to my bedroom for a minute." is there any neighbor, friend, or policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go?
no, i mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award. we don't know what that adjustment will be.
how does it conflict with federal banking authority for the state to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?
 because you  you just said that this  the handcuffs  the circumstances  the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.
mr. hurt, can you  can you go back a few steps? because there was a difference between an answer that you gave and one that mr. browning gave. he said it's a mixed bag, the litigation of whether it's brought in one action and the whistleblower is making both claims or whether the retaliation claim is saved out and brought in a separate action. you said the vast majority of the cases involve the whistleblower asserting both claims in a single action. which characterization is right? mixed bag or vast majority?
indeed. that was prior to the 
we believe that the court is not absolutely limited by the defenses 
but what he has 
can  can you tell me, ms. mahoney, just in  in a case where the person is directly implicated  he was the one discriminated against. he obtains in a suit the damages for the loss of the profits in the contract. what are the other damages? does he get emotional distress?
i said do either. what i  what i was thinking of, which isn't clearly i think coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means. fine. he either has to sign and say, leave it off tomorrow, i'm not home, or if the post office doesn't make that available, then if the letter comes back undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice has to send him an ordinary letter.
before you go off on this, the one statistic that interested me  and i'd like you to discuss its relevance really  is if we look back 10 years, i have only three states executing a juvenile: texas, 11; virginia, 3; and oklahoma, 2.
what's the problem? i grant you i could imagine a case that could be a problem. maybe it was a houseboat. okay? (laughter.)
i  i don't  good. are you going to explain this? because i thought what we were supposed to do is just look to the sheet, charge; the plea, guilty. and that is what we do and it disposes of 98 percent of the cases.
that  that  i agree that that is expensive. however, it seems to me that it would be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than with 
yes. or did it predate that?
you're  you're not really urging us to  to defer the  the evil day and simply say, well, this test, which is more than rational basis, may well apply to  to whether there's been a  a public use or not, but it certainly doesn't apply to whether there's been a taking.
but we  this case is about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it. and before your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of your difference, your reading and the government's, you say judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and the government says it means any judgment. so to buy your interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark after judgment and put on the merits. but the statute doesn't say on the merits.
now, i don't care that he doesn't have evidence.
what is the use of them if they have to follow all of the procedures required by the ucmj? i mean, i thought that the whole object was to have a different procedure.
we believed, at the time, that there was standing with respect to the property taxes  - the municipal taxpayers, with respect to the property taxes. that was the 
that arises from the regulations that the westlands water district has enacted that provides for the delivery of water from westlands to the individual farmers. the united states' obligation 
that's right.
i don't think that the safe-harbor provision substantially bears on this case at all. first of all, arthur andersen never raised the safe-harbor provision, so that the government would 
you  you know, i'm the police commissioner and i have a policy that you  you obey the law, you knock and announce, and  and i know that this particular officer disregards it all the time. you really think that's not going to go in his record?
 that it was agreed that there  that the site where the body was found, that that was dry, that that was dry ground. i thought there was no dispute about that.
all of the evidence 
well, it may not be necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when we write the case. we're not writing just on a very fact-specific issue. of course, the follow-up question, and the solicitor general can address it too, is this: assuming some race-conscious measures are permissible to have diversity, isn't it odd to say you can't use race as a means? i mean, that's the next question. that may, in fact, be why you give the  seem to give the answer that you do. you just don't want to embrace that contradiction.
thank you, mr. strain. mr. verrilli.
as is consistent with washington law, it's read to the jury at  at the outset, but it  it would be inconsistent, i think, with practice in washington to have actually submitted the  the information to the jury. in a situation like this, where the wrong entity has determined a person's guilt, despite the jury's complete verdict on a lesser offense, the application of harmless error simply eviscerates what blakely sought to draw as the limits  or excuse me  as the  as the outer boundaries of the jury's right. and in fact, it  it's the equivalent of a second sixth amendment violation because in each instance, the jury's complete verdict on the lesser offense is being set aside. in the first instance, it's based on the trial court's review of  of the strength of the evidence, and in the second instance, it's based on the  the appellate court's review of the strength of the record to support not the jury's verdict, but instead the trial court's assessment of the proper charge.
if she and her husband, you know  if she had a right to be in only two rooms, she couldn't authorize the search of the whole house, right?
this is a lot of money involved, and  and you certainly didn't argue it here. i don't recall that point being argued. and with all that money being involved, i would have thought it would have been argued.
well, they created the land mine basically. i mean 
 what's the case that you're citing for this proposition, that the president and the senate can, in effect, confer on an international tribunal the obligation to bind this court with reference to an interpretation of a treaty? what's the best case you've got for that?
well, and of course 
right.
but was  was this under the old policy that you're talking about what occurred?
can you  can you give me an example? because most of the things i think of is either you can have kosher food or you cannot. either you can wear a yarmulke or you're not. there's not other  another alternative. most of these things are yes and no. what is the case where, well, you can't have this but we'll give you something lesser?
nor corruptible. the  the evidence is quite clear. even in the few examples that they cite to like the tobacco industry passing out $40 checks after a  a vote defeating a bill. of course, that's still legal under this  this act. but, you know, even pointing out that they  that the person who talked about that example made it clear that he didn't believe anybody was  was influenced by post-contributions after a vote regarding a matter that's not even prohibited by this  by this act. so it was  it was a lot of testimony about how truly clean vermont is, not the most corrupt, where people  politicians would be tempted at these quite low limits to, you know, sell their honor and  and personal, you know  and their  and affect their own, you know, personal character and reputation.
may i ask 
 is used?
no. we think the better view, in fact, justice scalia, is that that would not be an extraterritorial application of u.s. law. but if the court were to disagree, then we would say title iii does not apply at that time.
 other employer.
it has to be arising from services rendered. i mean, it  it really has to be part of the contract with the employer 
but not the general privacy of the home, because you don't dispute that if he had waited an additional 4 seconds, he could have entered the home and executed the warrant.
but was it raised before the federal circuit?
except if they think we didn't know what we were doing. i 
that's correct, your honor. and just as the contract claims are barred, so are the preferential 
thank you, mr. marshall. you mr. owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.
and a judge makes a big mistake 
thank you, counsel. mr. hallward-driemeier?
and there  we  we  but we do not proceed on the contract. the does, in fact, do not underestimate the risks of disclosure of their identities and of their relationship with the cia. perhaps they put too much into the complaint describing at some length what they did, but the reason for that, i suggest, is understandable. it was subject to preapproval by the agency. why not put the equities in there even though they're not essential elements of your claim and see if the agency approves them? the agency approved them. we should not be thrown out of court because we put into the complaint allegations which the agency admits using the doe, do not threaten any secrets, and which are not part of the essential elements of our claim.
 in 1991, social security benefits were just, sort of, off the table. they weren't on the radar screen at all. and that's the ultimate problem with the government's 
not to my knowledge.
no, i'm not aware of any, your honor. i also suggest that if this were the concern that the ninth circuit were looking to address by the closely related offense doctrine, the remedy sweeps far too broadly in both directions. it punishes officers who at the scene engage in remarkable good faith conduct. i mean, these two police officers i think are what the public would hope these police officers were, looking at a code book at the roadside, calling a prosecutor late at night, trying to get it right. they are punished under this doctrine. those that are rewarded are those who are smart enough, perhaps a veteran, perhaps someone who has read the ninth circuit's cases, to stay completely silent, to say nothing at all, knowing that he's going to be fine. he needs to engage in no 
no, i'd like the  these are very expensive, this litigation. you're all the way in the supreme court. it's costing people a lot of money. and if there is a legal issue here, i'd like to find out what it is. i have exactly the same question justice stevens had, which is where i started. do you agree that the company you sued, called lincoln property, is a texas corporation, yes or no?
it may well be, but that's how 14 they wrote it. i'm talking about the word facts.
all right, but 
based on money.
yes, sir. it  it would have to be classified as 
yes, your honor, because there's a three-year difference between the two and substantially different facts. the  we have to go back, i think, to the case that's at bar, because it is those claims, the claims that were filed in the current case that are the issue. as i say, we are in the process of doing objections to those claims and i think that ultimately we will come within them.
yes, exactly right. and they would, of course, have had to make the very implausible assertion, in a business in which there is no plausible lock-in, that somehow a set of isolated events  e-mails  a handful of e-mails out of literally, between the two companies, 1700 a day, that might have said, "why don't you load some music up"?  are somehow the causal  the cause of what is going on today. let me say a few words about what the record says about legitimate activities. altnet is a company  this is at 1169 and -70 of the joint appendix  they say that they have distributed, on peer-to-peer systems, hundreds of thousands of authorized songs, and, they say, millions of pieces of  of video games, leading to sales. this is not a trivial number. jive, at page 67 to 68, speaks about 250,000 peer-to-peer downloads of a music video. the internet archive, which is talked about in the record, and if you now look at what they are on their website, now lists some several hundred musical artists with 20,000 recordings which are being put out there for peer-to-peer distribution. the creative commons is licensing all kinds of things for authorized public distribution. there are musical bands 
thank you, mr. garre. mr. goldstein, you have about 40 seconds.
i'm  we're trying to explore the  the meaning of  of this  of this assent. i know there are going to be hard cases, but i want to try to see how we describe this area where it is for the court.
yes.
your honor, it wouldn't change the clearly established prong. we still have the general rule, but i think that your instance is one that all judges would agree is so egregious that it falls within the ambit of that, and would require habeas relief.
 just 
i do not think that that would be a sufficient reason, your honor, because 
 for police departments, of course 
yes, you may do so. mr. clement, you're welcome to stand up for a second time.
the obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a federal employee, whether you're in alaska or whether you're in virginia.
but, of course, at the time  pre-iirira, the choice was: stay in the country and seek  and seek american citizenship through these other routes. and so, the forcing of him to leave is itself a retroactive effect of the enactment of this act 
well, your honor, i  when it comes to "overruling a lot of law," i think that the fundamental fact here is that, in the trilogy, the case was always sent back for a new trial. never was judgment entered in favor of the party that had failed to prove its case. so 
well, but there  no, but this is a consequence of violating the law of  of arkansas. certainly the state can impose consequences for violating its law.
and you'd start out with the premise that 90 percent of these cases are really houses anyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the government?
i don't distinguish between the two, your honor. and ultimately the reason for it is, is that a third part of the plan language is that it contains essentially a pre-agreed allocation. that's all that it does. it says because of the risk of manipulation in these settlements where the insured will settle a third party claim and say, okay, it's a million dollars, but let's write $10,000 in for medicals and the rest will be pain and suffering because we don't want to have to pay back on subrogation. so it is well established, both within and outside the erisa context, in these types of situations, that the subrogation language will contain an allocation so that when you get the money coming back, it is applied first to the medical damages. that is  that is all that it is. it is  it is not something that exists outside.
 what's the difference between the checkoff and the excise tax?
but i think at least, at least under that scenario, the district court still only has to take one look at the case and then it can move forward, it deletes the unexhausted claims. so from a judicial efficiency standpoint i think the ortiz v. mcbride rule out of the second circuit, which is the rule that we are advocating, is  is the cleanest approach. it takes the choice away from the prisoner; it puts the choice with the district court, and it allows the district court to delete off any unexhausted claims. and in most instances 
i've never heard that described as a mitigating factor before. i mean, it's certainly worse if you're a triggerman, but i don't know what makes it  somehow it's mitigating if you were not the triggerman. i would say that you're not guilty of something even worse. but to call that a factor of mitigation 
why wasn't that the time at which it was clear that the ninth circuit no longer had jurisdiction?
so it's kind of a reverse supremacy. where it's usually the feds that have the last word, but here you're saying michigan has decided that it will let occ go first and michigan will be kind of a supervisor for the adequacy of the occ's handling of the consumer's complaint?
yes, your honor.
your first answer to justice souter was that the physician would say you can't be prosecuted under our law. do you mean this act that we're looking at here? or do you mean the law generally including constitutional protections that this court has proclaimed?
thank you mr. farr. mr. salmons.
may i 
okay.
and it does so by means, in effect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is intended to cover every process that might be relevant to establishing that natural fact.
why?
the latter is a very close case, justice souter. i think you're right insofar as it  it can be important to distinguish between a modern-day excited utterance and what would have been considered a res gestae type statement at common law. certainly if you take away the 911 call from your hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me, adrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that would be inside the res gestae. once somebody picks up the phone to call 911, that, by my reading of the historical cases, turns it into a report or a narrative.
in that case, your honor, parents' position is that the government can't be in the position of deciding what right racial mix is.
suppose it doesn't begin in the united states in that it  it starts in, say, the bahamas, and stops at 
then make it a water park. i mean, you want to say it's a  it's a water-accessible park, fine.
i know you do, but 
that, by itself, wouldn't count as an injury.
the 
what, what's notable is that congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c). it provided in 1447(e) for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction post-removal. it had of course been the rule since this court's decision in st. paul mercury indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. and when congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time  and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as i said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events.
right.
i think the other reading is  the assumption was  and i think it's incorrect  that we would simultaneously identify the new right and decide it is or is not retroactive. that was the assumption i think.
okay, but even if you do that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the problem  whether you characterize the problem as discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy or not, you're still left with a speech problem that they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and you are forcing them to change their own message. you're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative. and those arguments don't depend upon the  sort of, the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.
all right. so once you say that, you realize that there are billions and billions of searches that go on every day that the police don't have to justify at all. they just look around.
and before the agency, you don't get counsel fees?
how can this be a fact 17 supporting the  you  you want us to say a fact 18 supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up 19 to the facts supporting the conviction or  or supporting 20 the claim.
and is it still done that way?
well, there's a lot of conjecture about whether  i gather that there's something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus on how much of that is attributable to human activity. and i gather that  what is it? something like seven percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to automobiles in the united states?
i think rather than  than to kill somebody it certainly would be.
but the gulf oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. it's just another forum is more appropriate.
we're back 
yes, it could. i mean, if  if this  this truck is making one  one haul, it's carrying some goods from texas to  to maine, but some other goods it picks up along the way within tennessee and just carries it to another place within tennessee, and then it picks some other goods in new jersey, carries it elsewhere to new jersey, you're going to be taxed. it seems to me it's  it's one trip. we never used to  used to divide railroads on the basis of well, the icc has jurisdiction over just the interstate portions and  and the two stops within a state can be regulated by the state.
well, and letters are carried in a mail truck, but we allow a cause of action for negligence of the driver of the mail truck. that's unique to mail, too.
now, maybe  i think that's how he's reasoning.
i don't think they were really arguing that particular point. i mean, that's not the way i would have read the argument that epa was making. but, and the bottom line is they didn't address this issue in wepco. to the extent they came close to addressing this issue in wepco they lost it in the seventh circuit because wepco adopted an interpretation that's much closer to what we are asking for. the answer given on the other side at this point, that we should have  we should have sought a determination. well, the problem with that, of course, is every one of these projects was being inspected. the record is replete with examples from north carolina and south carolina and epa inspectors on site looking at every one of these projects.
but there's one feature of this that is  does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not. the employer  there's a tradeoff in workers' compensation. it's not just i'm going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but i'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability that i might otherwise have. and in the other cases of the other benefits, there is no  no such tradeoff.
well, it would matter.
thank you. the case is submitted.
no, but did we  your  your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage.
that  i  i think that's correct.
the word "commence" instead of "exhaust," which this court has expressly, again, distinguished from an exhaustion requirement. moreover, under those statutes congress has limited the meaning of "commencement" in such a way that this court has interpreted congress to expressly preclude the possibility of a procedural default by virtue of a failure to comply with state filing provisions.
 "this particular search" 
thank you, mr. gossett. mr. srinivasan.
2005? okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.
we 
 larger number, that is true.
but if 
well, isn't it 
well, i think, you know, at some point, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on point because no one has said anything so outrageous. if a prosecutor went up and said look, ladies and gentlemen, the judge is going to tell you about aggravating and mitigating circumstances; forget all that baloney, go in there, you know, put all that out of your brain, and give him death. i don't think there would be any question 
 released prior to that time.
mr. multhaup, one aspect of your argument i wish you would clarify, and that's in your brief at page 20, footnote 3. as i understand it, you are saying  you are not challenging factor  the factor (k) instruction as excluding skipper evidence. your challenge is limited to this particular case. is that what you're saying in that footnote?
well, they say, "this is our evidence that it is likely." just what i said.
could you address the last point?
you are right, justice souter, insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that the caller is availing himself of. but congress has not said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders. all congress says in section 226 is that the caller cannot be required to pay in advance. the fcc during its rulemaking proceedings actually considered two alternatives where the caller would have paid in full compliance with section 226. one would be the caller paying with a later billing device like a credit card, billing it to their home phone number. another option the fcc considered would have been where the long distance providers would have billed customers on behalf of the pay phone operators. either way, the customer would have paid. even the respondent in his brief openly 
of the adjusted gross income.
pickering balancing, i take it.
some of the concerns about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by the seventh circuit and are the reason they adopted a  a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in  in strickland. why isn't that adequate to meet those concerns?
do you think they have a good reason, yes or no? because i'm not an expert in foreign affairs. the epa probably is more than i am. but do you think that if they do rest their decision on their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper basis for an agency like the epa to refuse to regulate?
mr. clement, the 
 there would be a claim to go through the balancing 
but  but that's not the ground on which the ninth circuit decided it. the ninth circuit never had to reach the question of whether there was probable cause on these other grounds 
a lot of people don't read footnotes. (laughter.)
 "for this or that." i mean 
"not only did we agree to it, but we you can't even do it if you agree to it."
i think i understand your argument based on 3(e), but when i look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way. it says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability. it seems to me that's the most difficult express language for you to deal with. it doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a parent. and i understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party.
so it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. it made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.
but  but your  is  is it  i understand it to be your position that there simply is no search here. period.
 that the response to a complaint is an appeal.
there's  they'll  there's no variation in state offenses that would fall within that, a theft offense?
for  for purposes of appeal, that  that would be true, but in  in this case, as we think the advisory committee notes made clear, the  the burden is on the party, seeking to secure a final judgment, to confirm that a mandate has issued. in fact, in 
how did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?
 probably, directly relevant to this case. on that one point, when i was in practice, it used to irritate me sometimes that the judge should grant the motion and then he'd just sit on it. but i see the wisdom for the rule now, and the judge reserving it, in the event the jury comes out the right  the, quote, "right way," anyway. what if there's a very long trial? what if, after the plaintiff rests, there's a good grounds for granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the judge doesn't do it, and then there's a 3-month trial? do the judges ever take that into account?
of course, all  this whole argument begs the question. it  it assumes that the particularity requirement includes time, not only who, what, where, but also when. right? i mean, you  you acknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're wrong about the fact that who, what, and where automatically includes when, the argument you've just made doesn't get anywhere.
well, in our experience the district courts don't tend to want to go ahead. but i would suppose that if the  if the court did, rules of comity are sufficient to allow the state courts to have the first crack at issues that are arising in the criminal cases, to be the ones that 
the case is submitted.
why not?
it's (i). it is (i).
it's one thing to turn to state law to get an answer where there is no other answer. the problem here is that state law and federal law are at odds in determining the gravity of the offense. the federal law, on my hypothesis, would say, "it is minor; it's just a misdemeanor." the state says, "no, it is a felony." it seems to me very odd, given the tension between the state and federal classifications, to say that, for federal purposes, the state classification is going to trump the official federal classification; and that's a different situation from the one you posit.
well, in  as far as our position is concerned on our submission so far, we don't think the court needs any further evidence. on the question of the application of the convention, as we say, we believe that is a question of law. this court has long deferred to the position of the executive branch on the interpretation of conventions. and 
my  my view on that is that the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate report of a crime are really in the form of excited utterances that are much different from the kind of dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that prompted the confrontation right. now, the court could accept that line and say that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the meaning of the confrontation clause, or it could disagree and say that no, when there's not the immediate threatened, imminent potential for a recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat it as testimonial. court could go either way on that without touching the core of what's at issue today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a threat to the safety of the person who's making the call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.
no, because that's a general intent crime. there's no specific intent and no requirement that he perform any overt act.
what of dual motive?
well, just on that last point, i mean, we are interested of course in different interpretations, but it just seems to me that your interpretation would have very little practical effect. official
i think it 
your honor, when they discussed the history on the floor of the house and senate, they felt that it protected for emergencies and there was no discussion of this narrow category of cases short of death.
that assumption would not be based upon probability or based upon police training. officers in pursuit situations are trying to believe 
counsel, i suppose this  this right applies on appeal as well. right? somebody says, i want mr. fisher to argue my case in the supreme court. i don't want anybody else. and  and yet  and we get motions for admission to our bar pro hac vice. if we deny one of those, does that violate the sixth amendment?
yes, yes.
and yet, he's not defrauded.
it is  applies to the general conditions in adx  the general populations in adx florence and usp marion.
it is probable that he's going to be receiving it. however, what occurred  what  the  the problem that occurs in such a situation is that is that the warrant issuing process itself, which is part of the machinery of government  the actual process of issuance is completed with anticipatory warrants by the officer in the field. it's not fair to say that the warrant has been issued and the magistrate provides it to the officer. at that point, it's not a valid warrant. a warrant cannot be issued if it's not valid by definition. so what you have 
there's just no finding that it was simply the death penalty that 
i mean, halliburton is not an indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.
i think one could also make the argument that that cuts the other way. the fact that there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean there's not a lot of violations going on, that the police are not routinely kicking down doors without knocking and announcing when they should, and that's why they're not being sued.
well, this case isn't as extreme as that, is it? it has to do with evidence admitted at trial.
well, you have to weigh in on it. i mean, you have to show that the  it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense. and if "micro color" doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you lose.
we're not suggesting that automatically that there is withhold with relief because of a nonwillful infringement. we're simply drawing the  the distinction between a case, such as this, where there is willful infringement  and, in fact, the party has been found to have both had notice of the patent and also have known that it did not  did not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was not infringing or the patent was invalid. in those circumstances, the patentee takes on greater risk than the party that simply is not aware of the  of the patent and in a sense stepped over a property line without realizing that, in fact, it was there. this is, again, a four-factor test, and we believe all factors need to be considered in order to provide the 
which "loss" doesn't, and "miscarriage" doesn't.
well 
the case is submitted.
presently and future defendants.
no. okay. well, then  then what do they have to show? they have to show that  that their salaries were  were reduced? but  but you haven't shown that here. you didn't plead that here. they have to show  show that a contract with them was breached? but you didn't plead that here and you didn't show it here. so the  the only thing that  that you  you can answer is they would all have causes of action if their  their honorific values were somehow impugned.
but the point is once there's a batson challenge, it has to be articulated.
what is different?
well, i think  i think, as with the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the mentally retarded, adolescents  the  the role of deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure. and in fact, if you look at what happened in this case, it's as good an example as any. the state says, well, okay, you know, he  you know, this guy, according to the state's witness, the person, who was over 18 and described as the fagin of this group of juveniles, testified to the court, well, christopher simmons says, let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.
yes, you do. for example, if someone brought a trespass action against a federal law enforcement officer for entering upon their land, you would apply the same state law as it relates to trespass claims against private persons. those claims may, for example, have a defense of lawful authority to enter. when looking at whether or not a police officer had  a federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might then look to federal law to determine whether or not the officer had authority to enter, but you would still be applying the principles of private-person liability. if one concluded that there was no private-person analog, then the only answer under the federal tort claims act would be that the united states cannot be liable.
well, i don't think so, justice kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say that there's this tradition with insanity, which is quite different than the tradition with respect to other elements of a crime. and i think that goes back to the common law, and goes back to blackstone. and if you look at blackstone, and you look at some of the common law cases that this court cited in its davis opinion, they describe murder as having several elements. one of them is obviously killing a person, and one is malice aforethought. and then, some of the cases treat a sound mind as a separate element. but, i think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't a true element, because the common law put the  it started with a presumption of sanity, which you couldn't have with respect to any other element, and said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on the defendant. and i think what the common law recognizes is the question of criminal responsibility or insanity, although it has some logical relationship to mens rea, can be separated out and can be dealt with in an affirmative defense. and i think if you don't recognize the state's ability to do that, you end up allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as justice souter put it, the front door, all sorts of watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of arguments trying to negate mens rea.
suppose 
okay. thank you.
 based upon their pondcrete design.
i wouldn't think so.
yes. the key paragraph from number 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as well as numerous other places in the materials. it says, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable relationship to the harm caused to jesse williams by the defendant's punishable misconduct. although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what that reasonable relationship is, you're not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct of other persons who may bring lawsuits of their own, etc.
we don't necessarily intend to take a  another judgment in federal court.
yes.
yeah.
what is their view of it?
but the administrative remedy that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private right of action, or isn't it? would you get the same thing? i complained to the agency, and say, i didn't get  the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and x under the commission's regulations was supposed to pay it. so i complained against x. could i get before the fcc exactly official what i could get in court, so that we're only talking about which form is proper, or is there a difference in the remedy?
and when the  and when the evidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought it would, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the day for the government.
no, justice souter, i suggest that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, is perhaps congress wanted to move, make clear that under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance. but that still doesn't tell us separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful" had been interpreted by this court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard. and i respectfully disagree with 
if it's an affirmative defense, then why is it  why is it proper for a district court, for a district court, to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense?
that would be true but that 
i agree, but 
that's what we haven't yet had the opportunity to prove as to what it is in these regulations. but if you would look at  again, at the respondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that they voluntarily made available, did not make any assertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that this was confidential asked, are there agency regulations that you know of that relate to the resettlement of these pl-110 people who are resettlees from foreign countries? yes. are there regulations that deal with the determination of the level and extent of benefits to be given resettlees? yes. and are there agency regulations that deal with grievances by resettlees? yes. we think no minimal due process allows them to tell us the wrong standard and not to give us notice and an opportunity to be heard in a confidential proceeding 
so  so  but i'm trying  what i'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take  just reading it in english, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a  a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.
no. no.
what he's saying is it should be read to include only those causes of action under 3730 that the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in (c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be interpreted to  to include only those causes of action that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those  those actions under 3730 that involve the united states. i mean, that's  that's a perfectly reasonable 
the state is not saying, "we will not come up with an iep." the state is saying, "this is what we're going to give you," and the parents say, "it's not good enough."
and it did so by reference to the claims that had been filed in the previous chapter 7 case. we can't object to claims in a chapter 13 case that haven't been filed. so procedurally, we had to go back to the chapter 7 case and do the claims objections within the context of the old chapter 7 case. now, in the chapter 13 case we used the  the bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that had been filed in the chapter 7 case to determine eligibility in the 13. in doing so, the bankruptcy court basically announced a new rule of law that the claims that had been filed would be essentially i suppose, res judicata in the subsequent case, but that in some cases a chapter 7 debtor 
so you say he's not entitled then.
no. i 
is there a security reason or is 
this is a far more  most respectfully, this is a far more sophisticated investigative tool.
is it 
and the oregon supreme court says you can make that argument, because the eighth amendment requires you to be able to make that argument.
so you  so you have two  in california you have two definitions of a prima facie case, one for batson and one for all normal tort litigation.
look at the statute in its entirety. this isn't a statute that just deals with pleading scienter. look at the provisions dealing with the selection of lead representative, which has produced this incredible shift from '95 to public institutions, pensions and labor unions. they don't bring frivolous cases. look at the control that statute gives over selection of them with notice provisions to make sure you've got the 
thank you, mr. feldman. mr. ravenell.
thank you, counsel.
7426 clearly prevents a person from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in 1346, that is possible. but in this case, 1346 is broad enough because it uses the term collected. and just like in williams, we are not seeking to contest the underlying assessment.
because?
but has it ever been applied in a  to a statute that specifically says that the term "aggravated felony" applies to an offense described in this paragraph, whether in violation of federal or state law?
well, that's not the competition. that's the question as whether there is discrimination. the question is, do volvo dealers compete against other volvo dealers, in the first instance? and with respect to that, the testimony was absolutely clear, it's in the  witnesses for volvo  are quoted in our brief at page 8  explicitly say, "we compete, on a daily basis, in the region and the district, volvo dealer to volvo dealer." now, there's a separate 
you  you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and  and it would be  on which you prevailed. and in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get. but  but at this stage at least, the  the door  there  there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, sabic hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.
no, no. i'm not talking about that because obviously they can do what they want, i think, in the state courts, but they might violate federal law if they do it. and now so what's happened is somebody has gone into federal court or this court and federal court or this court has said: here's a federal error, of course you're free to apply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to let the person have a new trial or let him out. but i've never seen an instance i can think of where, that having happened, the state then applied yet some third standard like absolutely egregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm or something like that. i've never seen. that's what i'm looking for. is there such an instance?
as a practical matter, yes, it would  it would 
mr. friedman, can i go back to your answer that the police will then  in response to the position that you're urging, will then protect the victim and all these fine things? it wasn't so long ago that the police wouldn't bother with these prosecutions at all. they didn't care about them. and if you say you're going to have to drag in the victim, you're going to have to jail her for contempt if she's so scared that she won't testify, they'll say, who needs it. we've got a lot of other crimes to prosecute.
and it goes to the 
it doesn't speak to it.
what did representative lobiondo 
well 
or who could live in the house.
 so, how is the policeman supposed to know that?
you're talking about an incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program is quite different from looking at a discrete program. the faith-based initiative is a discrete program, and one component of it is this set of conferences. this is not an incidental something pursuant to a large regulatory program. faith-based initiative is the name of this program.
would your answer be different if amendment were allowed? i mean isn't the problem in substance here, and i don't mean to dismiss your arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument from the text of the rules aside, it wouldn't be a real problem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed amendment, would it?
how can you possibly decide whether it  a reasonable juror could find this? let's assume that all three of the  of the minority, three blacks are stricken by the prosecution. the judge, the district judge, knows that everyone of them is  is a  a defendant's lawyer, every single one. he has to blot that out of his mind?
it's a 
yes, your honor. my understanding of when a right is newly recognized is  is when it is new in the sense that this court has adopted under teague v. lane, that it's not dictated by prior precedent. a right can be initially recognized by this court but not new in the teague sense.
i think that's exactly right, your honor. i think that's really the point, and you've obviously articulated it better than i did in my previous answer. but that's exactly right, that 
well, i  i don't know how simple that answer is, your honor, but i would  i would take it, as justice scalia said a moment ago. and if this court believes that mamsi could state that sort of equitable claim, we would be very comfortable with a remand in this case to weigh the equitable factors at issue. that didn't occur here, though, because mamsi argued that the contractual terms govern. the court agreed. and so as a result, the disclaimer of the made-whole doctrine, the requirement that mamsi established double recovery 
we are in the situation in which there's a need to apply the general principles for defining gross income.
what are they?
judge rawlinson i think said that using the brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice.
doesn't that give you a pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that qualifies under the act?
 it is also punishable; in which case, you lose. but, in the first case, you win.
all right. well, then  then the problem 
 almost ironic, to me, to say that you have a greater power to tell the whole industry to publish something they don't want to publish than you do to let them 
well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. so that necessarily requires the government to look at the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify it.
can you tell me  i didn't find it in the materials. maybe the statistics official aren't available. in the cases where intact d&e or d&x are performed in the period i guess, what, 16 through 20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do you have any idea, in how many of those instances is there serious health risk to the mother that requires the procedure as opposed to simply being an elective procedure? are there any statistics on that?
how about the initial letter that, in the agency practice, precedes the order? i gather there's a letter to the 
but 
cert was denied on december 1st and the second opinion was june 23rd. so it was a period of about 6 and a half months. it's less than that if you consider that there was a second petition to stay the mandate filed and granted, which didn't expire until january 23rd when the court of appeals received word that this court had also denied a petition for rehearing. we think that in any case the burden is on a litigant seeking to secure a final judgment and to ensure that the court of appeals jurisdiction over a case has ended.
that doesn't have to be fleshed out at all, unlike a rule 11 colloquy. to see if he really understands? do you know what that means, and he yes and that's the end of it?
we're not asking for a rule that broad, your honor. what we are suggesting is that where you have a publicly owned operation, a government operation, and it does not disproportionately benefit in state or local interests, as against out of state interests  but it always does. it benefits the people of the state, who make the money from the money from the, from the very expensive hamburgers that are sold by the state of california.
i  i think, your honor, that in  in the prior cases, in patterson in particular, that the court rejected the idea that it ought to be the state  the law of each state that governs the scope of the rights. that argument, i believe, was advanced by the solicitor general, and this court said, no, they didn't think that was correct. and similarly, in haddle v. garrison, which is a section 1985 case, this court looked to common law. but it  it said that it's really federal common law that controls these issues. so i think it's looking just to  to state law principles to inform what congress may have had in mind when it  it allowed for persons to recover for violations of the rights to make and enforce contracts. here 
 do you have confidence that florida can do that?
but 
but that's  that's a question of waiver or forfeiture. those are the ordinary rules that apply.
if it's not that  if it isn't the district court in that case, then you  the district court has to take this complaint and just freeze it until some other  a higher court rules on it.
well, those 
the bacchus case was a very unique situation that we believe is not in any way controlling in the present case. it was not an importation case; it was an exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers for alcohol that was already within the state's stream of commerce.
well, i  and i think in rust, some people would have been resistant to the idea that your government wants you to engage in family planning, but what the  what the court said about rust was that the government had established a program with a central message about counseling. that was then carried out by private individuals. here, this case is much stronger than rust.
you're  because you're saying they don't have it.
i don't  in that situation, there may be  i mean, in the same way that, in the sentencing, in the criminal context, other considerations come into play, it doesn't resolve it here. placing the burden of proof on school districts in these proceedings would erode the trust and confidence that congress placed in the judgments of state and local educational officials. it would create a demoralizing and destabilizing educational regime in which the judgments 
if it were to become relevant, would this record show  this is the school district  and this would be in the regime of the court-ordered desegregation plan, because you are just recently emerged from that  that the school district has tried means other than race conscious, of race classification in order to obtain the diversity benefits you seek?
what do you do about the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 706(b)? i mean, this provision says debtor may. the other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to order, and it suggests a difference in who has the official primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the court or whether it is an independent action.
justice kennedy 
 i come  i come back to the  the second circuit tried to deal with that problem and why isn't that adequate? they didn't leave the district judges to do whatever was their will.
about commentary or travaux, i don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't contradict the treaty. do we have any case where we use the  les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict the language of the treaty?
well, again, the  the rule does not preclude the practice. it is a common practice 
but you're 
 argument. you're sticking to your statutory argument.
if my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but i happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices. complaint?
here's the reason, your honor. at least, here's the reason that  as i understand it. much of the litigation in idea cases takes out  takes place outside the confines of federal court. most of the litigation takes place in state due process hearings. and what i believe congress was interested in making sure were the general rules, like rule 11, the general rules that punish parties for engaging in vexatious or frivolous litigation would have some analog in these proceedings. and therefore, what the court  what  what congress did was to authorize a federal court, in reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred before a state-administered tribunal, because that's where the action takes place in these cases, to  to be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was misconduct by the parent or  or the lawyer, misconduct in the sense of trying to protract litigation or multiply proceedings. and interestingly, your honor, the  the conference report addresses this issue and does explain  and now i'm quoting from page 6 of the  of the conference report, the joint explanation  that the court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys' fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they determine that this misconduct had taken place. so i think that at least in the conference report, congress is signaling that if there were other costs that were incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers protracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be subject to the same reduction.
but what your clients want to do is cash in on the fraud. they don't  their claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the fraud. that's the damages that they want to collect. and that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.
no, your honor, the muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the ten commandments, nor do hindus, or those who believe in many gods, nor of course, do atheists. and for that matter, your honor, if a jewish individual would walk by this ten commandments, and see that the first commandment isn't the jewish version, i am the lord, thy god, took you out of egypt, out of slavery, would realize it's not his or her government either.
i think you will find, your honor, if you look at the  at the law that's developed around void ab initio contracts, that it's fairly rare. it's a fairly small universe of cases where state courts have found that an entire line of business is illegal, where state courts have found that no contract ever comes into existence because of a public policy.
habeas is equitable relief and the court has a lot of discretion in identifying the boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?
we seem to be talking  may i just ask one  we seem to be talking about two different things. justice scalia was assuming that, if you have the license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from outside. and i  is that the assumption? or is your argument that new york can require  does require the in state warehouse, and you can ship into  in new york, you can ship only from that warehouse?
right. that's our argument.
the court has not. and we think that that is  the critical point about this  about this case and these programs, these are government  these are programs of government speech. as i said, congress, itself, prescribed the central message. congress established the government board, all of whose members are appointed by the secretary, to administer it.
no, sir. i  i'm not stating that. it would  it would be an offense, but based upon these facts.
it would seem that the  the same definition of firearm would apply.
no, it didn't say that.
thank you, justice kennedy.
okay.
i'll be interested in your answer, if you can get it out. [laughter.]
or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact.
doesn't the decision in black suggest the supreme court thinks that would be the result? the california supreme court?
 civil litigation.
have you answered my question? you're abandoning the assertion that the federal circuit did not consider anything that didn't go to the ind  that didn't go to the 
their point is that the former is subsumed in the latter. in other words, it makes no difference. but the arizona court  the arizona supreme court, in a state court decision, state versus chavez, indicated otherwise.
if the inquiry is a  clearly erroneous, yes. but our position is that whether or not there was initiation is a mixed question of fact and law, whether a reasonable person would understand the questioning was going to stop. and so, when you look at this reasonable-person analysis, you don't give deference to the findings of the lower court. and if i could reserve the rest of my time, if there are no more questions.
well, i think that they're 
justice o'connor, there's no constitutional requirement and there is no requirement in  in washington that that be done. a number of states do require that it be done statutorily and many of those states also 
if that's so, and if we get into balancing, which i don't know, what is to be said in favor of the indian side? it sounded to me as if it's harder for them to tax. so, i'm thinking, well, that's true of every tax. and then, put it on something else. put it on the tires. put it on anything else, if you can. it'll be harder for them to tax non-indians. but i didn't know they had a federal right to tax the non-indians.
in the old case, yes, once we converted the chapter.
right.
thank you.
i think it would have to be specific to the issues raised by the parties. and in this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address the three issues that mr. rita put forward and discuss those: his military record, his employment, his health concerns. it would have to address any issues that the government would raise, and any issues that the district judge was considering that maybe neither party had raised to the court as well.
yeah. yeah.
well, ordinary tort doesn't quite work, because i guess my public humiliation case is  could be an ordinary tort. somebody could go up to the porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail. and, moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission of my inheritance. see? they could. so, all those things could be ordinary torts.
well, justice scalia, we have concerns about that, as well. i don't know that we would give them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as  facilitate as much copyright infringement as possible. i think what we would say is that when you're  when a suit targets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there ought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed noninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing uses. i don't think, in fairness, that's what you have before you in this case, because this is a case where the peer-to-peer technology was out there, it was employed in a particular way, with a centralized server, in a way that was actually  had a lot of users involved in it, and they were users of the old napster system, that had a distinct character. they were using that system for infringing copyrighted musical works. and then these individuals come along and seek to capitalize on that market. that is their business plan from day one. and it's not some newfangled idea. the only newfangled idea here is that if you give something of value away for free by ignoring the copyright laws, you're likely to draw consumers to your site, and you're likely to attract advertisers. but that cannot be the kind of innovation that we want to further through a development of secondary liability into the copyright laws.
'68. now  so 35-40 years. now  now, how many times do you think that people  i mean, the  the  if you've used it only a dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound like a major threat. what i'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling bibles. that really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the eastern european countries, and these aren't fanciful examples i've been giving you. and so if you were in congress  or  or why do you think that congress would have wanted to get the courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? and we start distinguishing one country from another. and what are the procedures in the ukraine or kazakhstan anyway? i mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of a dozen cases in 40 years.
do you think there's any constitutional difficulty with the preemption provision in this statute?
okay.
there could be a problem that you have to have a fair chance to present evidence and so forth.
going back to the asphalt case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim for a process patent, that it might have been valid?
i didn't think so. (laughter.)
thank you, mr. frey. the case is submitted.
that, that's right, your honor. and i think that's why this case should be relatively straightforward. because the ninth circuit, the ninth circuit's finding, that the state court unreasonably found that, that landrigan expressly instructed that his attorney not present any mitigation, given that  that's the problem with the ninth circuit's opinion. everything else builds on top of that. if that's an incorrect holding, then the rest of the ruling is, is incorrect.
it is, justice ginsburg, to look at the  the threat to the quiet of the community as one aspect of this. but the case contains even more. the case contains a punch that did some harm to another person in a kitchen setting where there is a strong possibility of escalating violence. it's the additional facts of that violence that was a potential there, added to the noise and the evidence of underage drinking, that made the totality of the circumstances objectively reasonable for the officers to 
well, to 
one way to do that is to say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of the harm that comes from the commission of the crime itself. i mean, there is  i don't want to overdo it, but the risk of harm to others from the  from the step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the act itself of putting the ladder up against the building and taking the step. it's only because that creates the potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is measurable. i mean, we know there are cases in which victims get shot when they appear in the course of burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.
thank you, mr. jones. mr. carty.
suppose they don't do it. they don't do it. they violated the treaty.
well, you can't get too far 
well, it seems to me that if  if there's no violation, then there's no triggering event to start the statute of limitations running.
 about what the sg has conceded.
 that is correct.
judge kozinski thought the real problem here was we should not deify strict scrutiny. that's what's caused all the problems.
your honor, the only kind of case to which this applies is a case exactly like triplett, a case exactly like caplin & drysdale where the claim is that the underlying change in the law or the underlying law disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the criminal defendant or the defendant to representation.
sure, but i thought willful ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of, maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes. and it seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.
 to be clear, that's not the position we're saying that is the dta. that's not presented here.
 that there was a tie between  i'm sorry.
 be rather farfetched. the pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that we are teaching our students equality, the equal stature of all people. so, i think that your example does not fit 
then can you just explain that? because the policy says that he shall get notice and attached to the notice will be a committee report. then they have a copy of the form that the report is supposed to fill out on page 58 to about page 78 and it's about the most detailed thing i've ever seen. so 
but on an issue like this, the filibuster, it's the senators who are doing it, and their ad referred to not only the senator who was up for election, but the one who was not.
are you saying that it's parallel to what apa review of an agency decision would be?
well, that's 
that's gone. but just because congress could have made it clearer doesn't mean that the government loses here.
that is 
the  the state does have an 5 interest. the problem is that when there's a delay in 6 filing a challenge to a state conviction, one of two 7 things can be happen  can happen, and the cases bear 8 this out. one is that you have a state prosecutor who is 9 perfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but, 10 because of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite 11 records aren't available. the other thing you see in some 12 of these cases is that because the state sentence has been 13 served by the time it's challenged in cases of this type, 14 the state prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of 15 incentive 
well, it is in the nature of a compromise, your honor, and there's nothing in this agreement that gives them a right to sue. they have to find some legal right. what they're really saying  what their argument has always been is that lear actually creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue at any time of their choosing. that's been their argument from the beginning.
is that true? or what happens?
but doesn't that mean your client should have to put forward some evidence establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that point?
that's correct. and i think that the court  it is correct that the record before the state court of appeals was inadequate to address  to answer the question. but i think what  where the court erred is in adding and grafting on an additional element. it goes beyond that sentence that, justice breyer, you focused on. i think it is that the  it is the element of branding. it's that this wearing of the buttons in a sense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors.
well 
it goes to your 
yes.
 is  is correct.
 the extension period 
i don't think so, but that would certainly be a closer case if there 
that's correct.
the prosecutors. i'm sorry. mr. chief justice, and may it please the court: the prosecutors argued that there was ample evidence, quote/unquote, pointed 
i think the government has an interest in uniformity of the manner in which the  the employees are ultimately treated, and i think when we talk about uniformity, that that's what we ought be talking about.
if  if all 
no. i do not. i think  i think the point that you make that a principal sees the banner across the street and sees the word bong hits, and  and at the very moment when the olympic torch was about to arrive, i think it was. she made a quick judgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display of the slang words bong hits 
can i ask you about one factor in particular? what if by the time you get to the injunction stage, the  the patent office has, you know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a preliminary way? it's not final. can the district court take that into account in deciding not to issue an injunction?
but it was not brought under 390uu. instead, there was an allegation that the united states had acted unlawfully and the westlands relied on the administrative procedure act.
that is true. that is frequently the case, that in a  in a case that is being litigated, there are other proceedings that have the potential to make something moot.
i think in terms of the problems for the citizens of the city of sherrill, taxation is part of it, and sovereignty is part of it, and they go hand in hand.
absolutely 
now, did you have to prove that because, as  as i have assumed, the charge included the statement that he had used a handgun? was that the term used?
yes. yes, you can.
well 
the incidence of the tax 
would it be constitutional or unconstitutional?
well, it could have said a lot of things. but i find it  you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment. wow. you know, i just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.
justice scalia, 7426 has four different components. two of the components are clearly pre-deprivation type remedies. they are the ability of a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to prohibit the government from either selling property or conducting a levy. those are clearly pre-deprivation. the other two are primarily post deprivation remedies. and so the object that the government was trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis. i don't believe that the government's underlying purpose is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live in harmony. and without having an exclusivity provision expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346 on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third parties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be construed 
deadly weapon was still called an enhancement, your honor, under the statute. and so the statute defined deadly weapon very generally, and then in the punishment section, the punishment provisions, which specifically were formerly under section 310 of the sentencing reform act  now it's been renumbered to be 533. under that provision  you have two provisions, one which provides the punishment for deadly  for firearms, and under this  for this case, that would be 3 years. and then as to the rest, it says if someone was armed with a deadly weapon other than a firearm, you have a lesser penalty. so as i say, i think that for a long time we have treated  in washington, we've treated all of these things as deadly weapons, but recognized that if it was a firearm, the penalty was greater than if it were something other than a firearm.
and, justice breyer, what i would say is that our interpretation basically provides for pending claims exactly the way that congress did. with respect to any future claims that might be brought, there may or may not be a constitutional question. and if i could turn to our interpretation of the dta, it's the only one that really, i think, reads the various provisions in the statute in harmony. now, this court's decision in bruner, and in a host of other cases, says that when congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending cases fall, unless there's a savings clause. the closest thing to a savings clause in this statute, in e(1), is the provision that says "except pursuant to section 1005." and i think that's important, because if congress wanted to put in a savings clause of the kind that this court seems to refer to in bruner, and that would certainly be consistent with senator levin's intent, it would have been very easy. instead of saying "except for section 1005," they could have said "except for pending cases." the choice is important, because what does section 1005 provide? it provides the exclusive review in e(2) and e(3). and then, h(2), in very complementary fashion, says that, just in case there's any question about it, those provisions on e(2) and e(3) apply to pending claims governed by those sections. i think every word's important. it doesn't say "pending cases," it says "pending claims." congress understood two important things. there were no cases currently pending under e(2) and e(3), because congress was creating e(2) and e(3). it also knew that most of the cases before the d.c. courts had some claims that were pure challenges to the final csrt determination and other claims. so, what h(2) says is  h(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims governed by e(2) and e(3), they are preserved under e(2) and e(3); otherwise, this  there's no savings clause that covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is removed. the 
 are you saying that the government  that the only compelling-interest argument that the government can raise here is the discriminatory argument? since nobody denies that, if the government were recruiting without the discrimination, that there would  there would  there would be no problem with it. everyone would agree with  that that was a compelling 
so  so what is  i see the first circuit as trying to grapple with the very question you're raising, which is i think difficult.
justice souter, of course the state believes that it is. it is, first of all, consistent with this court's precedent as what is required 
would your  would your proposed exception, does it work the other day? i mean, let's say the district court entered this order and set a date certain for you to file the notice of appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other words within the 14 days given under the rule. would you be out of luck because of what the district court set out in its order as what's binding, as opposed to what the resume says? or could you rely on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?
yes.
well, because it's based on an examination of the underlying conduct, which is forbidden by the taylor decision 
against the police and  not the town. the town has absolute immunity but against the police under the tort statute, the police are not immune if their conduct is willful and wanton. and i think this court in deshaney addressed that very question when it looked like if the state wanted to create an interest here, that it could do so by modifying the 
 but i don't think 
such communications service.
is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?
but if you want the additional time that it takes for an opposition, for waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it, then you have to file a petition for cert?
but if it is defined as broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this. there has been no default on the obligation, and prior to getting to this court, $167,000 has been racked up in legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.
well, when we get down to clever attempts, aren't we at the clever attempt point when  when you say that they can enjoin the distribution to anybody else, including themselves, but they can't tell them to pay the money to  to great-west? i mean, isn't that the point at which we get to silliness?
shall not  shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate secretary would have otherwise provided. and then further down in the paragraph in the last  in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. and what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. and so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a federal agency.
well, what they'll say 
that's true.
but, with respect, justice breyer, i think that cuts both ways, because i don't think there's any particular interpretation of these provisions on the table before this court that's going to eliminate those potential suspension clause issues.
i understand. the other point that 
well, i'm assuming 
not  not in this first report.
on the issue that's before us now, i can understand why, if the, what we used to call, jnov is not requested after the jury verdict, the appellate court could not then enter judgment  direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law. but i don't see why it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to affirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so, if there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new trial. but you would say that that is not possible either.
many, many.
no, none of those are felonies under georgia law.
i don't think the military and the army recruiters  and i  and i won't be one of them  but i think the army recruiters are not worried about being confronted with speech, they're worried about actually not being allowed onto the same law schools 
and it would be reviewable. that's why  that's one of the reasons why the district court's order here is reviewable, because it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c) because, first of all, congress has instructed the courts that they are not to remand.
well 
well, it does make sense because, unlike the government's limitations, which have nothing to do with the rationale of flast or the underlying threepence here of james madison, that does  that is a particular amount of money that the government is spending and it's identifiable just because of religion. we think that that's 
but isn't that  isn't that crucial, though, in your answer to justice breyer? because if the united states  if opm approves the empire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee, there's something strange going on at opm that they don't require exactly the same terms in the contract with the employee that they  that they require in their master contract with  with empire. but it doesn't say anything one way or the other about the interest of the united states in having uniformity in which the  in the  in the interpretation and application of contracts, which they do approve, between empire, other blue cross blue shield entities, and their employees.
is that their burden?
that's very surprising. when i read the statute, it doesn't have one word about the retailer being obliged to pay 
it depends on what you mean by a "presumption." it certainly  it certainly says that unless you find something that outweighs this, the death penalty is the proper penalty.
then i guess that the  that the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after.
wait.
but the other  the other way avoids loading the district court with filings that are futile.
i'm not sure what the reference is, justice ginsburg. once the joint venture existed, equilon had its own marketing strategy, and motiva, the other joint venturer, had its own marketing strategy. the  the role of the owners at that point was on a members committee, which  as a typical board of directors where the  each ceo of each joint venture had to present a business plan and obtain approval by the owners of the  of the joint ventures for the upcoming year.
in 
what  what about the chief justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?
i don't know the 
again, if we compare the definition of a deadly weapon under washington law with the definition of a firearm under washington law, a handgun is by definition a deadly weapon. but a handgun is not by definition a firearm.
no, but he can preclude the tax court judge from doing what the tax court judge did in this case, which is simply adopting his report. if the  if the special trial judge refuses to change his report 
thank you, mr. chief justice.
well, your honor, i guess we'd go back to the proposition that  i believe that the district court could grant the 50(a) motion later; it did not have to wait for a 50(b) motion. and, in fact, it is a very common practice 
no, but if you can't grant a tax exemption  and it seems to me, a fortiori  you can't grant a prohibition about importing at all.
 it miss?
all right. so now you're saying a complaint has to have facts?
no, no, no, he's  so, i'm wrong. what i said is wrong. the answer has to be that  we're only talking about (a) at the moment. and what congress tried to do in (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is constitutional to do so. so, then, you say, if you lose on it, it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could  it is constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this situation that the state brings a case against the estate, and you can do an offset, et cetera. but it would have nothing to do with (b) and (c). it would have to do with reading that into (a), i guess.
there are no  i thought we were just talking about several.
can i ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?
correct. now, all we do is, we say, "we're not going to double it. you're going to pay the same. but everybody invests here, pays half."
but would they're 
well, is it  is it correct  i just want to be sure i follow you  that they determined that the estate plan was invalid?
may i ask to you clarify one thing. i initiated this line of questioning when i said i was surprised that your brief made such a big deal that he was late to school. you would still be making the argument about the free speech right if he had diligently showed up for his math class first period in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his banner to unfurl when the torch came by?
no, they did receive, they did receive consideration and the court made sure that that was 
yes, your honor.
justice breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [laughter.]
so your view is not limited to what happens in the territorial waters.
that problem is solved too if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, and if in fact before the statute of limitations expires, your client is brought to the court and is going to be prosecuted. tolled. they don't need two actions.
your honor, there is a body of law on that issue that already exists because courts have interpreted this provision since 1986. by and large, the costs that have been awarded under the statute are costs that are normally associated with litigation, copying costs, computer-assisted research when there's a lawyer involved.
as a dominant motive.
 and domestic violence cases are criminal prosecutions. so we don't think 
i wouldn't say it would be the end of the matter in the present case because the eligibility was never questioned below, was never a factor below.
i think that that would satisfy conventional pleading standards under rule 8(a). on the other hand, i don't think it would satisfy the second circuit's standard below, because the second circuit required enough facts to enable a court to wrap its mind around a complainant, understanding what it is you claimed happened. you don't have to prove your case as a complainant, you just have to 
yes, justice stevens.
that's  that's correct, your honor. the parties agree that a lower court can make the retroactivity decision as well, and that's because of 
thank you, counsel. mr. grant, you have four minutes remaining.
and those three states account for about 11 percent of the population of the country, 11.3 percent. now, if we go back a few more years to stanford, we get three others in there: louisiana, 1; georgia, 1; and missouri, 1.
could the 
for the  for the ring proposition?
if we can just continue on government speech, because that's where 
then, then what does the phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 or below 5 mean?
mr. meczyk.
no, your honor. if you look at section 1951(b), where it defines "robbery" and "extortion," it already includes "violence" in the definition of "robbery" and "extortion." there would be no need for congress to separately 
well, it's also used in the phrase "knowing and willfully." that appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.
why isn't  why isn't the simple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no way to tell in advance or, you know, by any general rule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got to go to try to find the correct address, but they know where the house is and they've got at that point to go to the house and put a notice on the door? that's simple, easy. why  why isn't that the answer?
are you abandoning it?
well, but if there are 
and  and if you're tempted to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about the death cases.
you want us to take 
yes, your honor.
sorry, justice breyer.
there is. and again, because 3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant 
what is the purpose of that requirement? as long as he has made known in the administrative proceeding what his problem it, and they have had a chance to investigate it and determine whether it has merit or not, why should he have to name the individuals who made the decision in order, before he can sue them when he later finds out who they are?
but you may use those race neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that mixture. i take it that's the assumption of your answer.
you can't give a yes answer to whether it's ever possible.
under your approach, mr. frederick, the federal court would decide the principal substantive issue in the case, the principal legal issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within  within (c), sends it back to the state court. is  is the state court bound by  by that finding by the federal court?
it would probably be in derogation of a more 
 is not a case where we have a 100-year body of law of class action after class action brought on state-law grounds for this type of claim.
no, i'm not so sure.
they're similar to the aedpa exceptions.
mr. marcus, it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically  you know  picking out attempted burglary. it is very hard to do that. why shouldn't we read this, this residual category to refer to the facts and circumstances of the particular crime of which the defendant has been convicted? the language enables you to do that. the term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury, physical injury to another. official why can't we not, not interpret that to mean generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which this defendant stands convicted?
i think that's what your friends on the other side are arguing.
 particular sales.
the original one?
well, then how are you going to prevent the funds from being commingled or being assigned immediately to a trust?
we do, your honor. one of the questions presented in raich was whether congress "could" do what it had done. the question here is  first of all, is whether congress "did" what it had done. and our point is not necessarily that it would be unconstitutional, but that it would raise a significant constitutional question, which implicates the clear-statement rule and the constitutional avoidance rule.
and what's on the other side? the other side 
well, what about  what if you  what if somebody runs out of the  the house? there are two people standing in the yard, a law enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor. she yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to kill me, and then he comes out. is that covered by your rule? it's not to a law enforcement officer. it's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement officer overhears it.
and the 
what your  what your opponents say is that the  the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some ira's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until  until you reach a certain age. and if they're structured that way, they would be covered. so you had to mention 408 in the  in the exceptions. what's wrong with that argument?
that is correct. she could not. and  and if i could just highlight a couple of points to  to demonstrate the significance of  of permitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal rulings. in massachusetts, the fact that there's a written motion here is quite unusual. these motions are made orally generally. the prosecution is not given an opportunity  does not  there's no requirement that he be given advance notice ever. there's no requirement of that. the prosecution argues in opposition to the motion on the spot, and the judge rules on the spot. and  and i think that  that procedure is demonstrated quite clearly here. the  the defendant filed the motion. the prosecution did, indeed, argue the correct response, legal response, did not have a case at hand and as 
counsel, if the state court had conducted a chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under federal habeas? you would ask under aedpa whether it was an unreasonable application of chapman?
and  and you would have  under their theory, you would have the consumer products safety act, the food and drug act, osha, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the united states. the problem here, as a matter of congressional intent, is we don't know what congress thought about this, and because congress 
it would have allowed her the opportunity 
other statutes do it separately.
"rate" is used as an annual rate in 51.166(b) (21) and (b)(23).
the  the  that is the line drawn by most of the lower courts.
of course not.
i understand that, but as long as you say that, the point that  that justice alito makes is  is well taken, that we  we thought that this was a  a statute designed to have the federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out that the federal court just takes the first swing at it, and if a state court disagrees, it's  it's free to do so.
it does.
being a cynic, i'm not so sure of that, judge. but  your honor. i'm sorry. i'm not so sure of that because early on in the  in blue cross blue shield's summary of the facts, they indicate that blue cross' fees in the matter are determined based upon performance. i don't know what performance means, but i suspect it has something to do with how much money ultimately ends up being spent. i don't think it's necessarily relevant to the inquiry that we're involved in. the fact that  that all of the money may ultimately go to the government, though, i don't think changes the issue as to whether or not this court should confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the district courts in this case. there  the  the issues here can be resolved in the state courts and more efficiently than in the federal courts. and certainly i think that the federal courts would not look forward to an influx of cases dealing with issues in  in essentially personal injury issues involving whether or not particular doctors were paid properly, whether or not particular payments need to be made in connection with and are reimbursable to the government, or the types of issues that we have here. and to be perfectly honest, most of the cases are not of the magnitude of this one where we're talking about $150,000. most of the cases involve $5,500 and $6,500 and things like that. the government 
but, mr. phillips 
but why can't you do that in an as-applied challenge? i mean, it may be that there was all this  suppose we wrote an opinion hypothetically. suppose  and it said, look, i've read through this new policy. i assume it will be administered in accordance with the elements of due process, the basic elements being some kind of notice basically what  what the factual part is, some kind of opportunity to present proofs in evidence that's a reasonable one, and some kind of decision by a neutral decision-maker. certainly the language of the new policy permits such an interpretation. it doesn't  and  and suppose we were to say, well, we assume it will have the basic elements, and it's so complex, so detailed that  that if they don't, then the individual who suffers could bring a claim and say it was administered unfairly in my case.
how can we possibly say that it's not ambiguous when we have, in another context, interpreted the identical language to permit 
then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument?
with all respect, let me quarrel with one of the premises in your question, which is that the  the expenses for experts are, quote, a big-ticket item. if you look at page 28, footnote 17 of our brief, we've tried to compile all of the reported cases on the amount of expert fees that are awarded. they tend to be exceedingly modest, your honor. they run from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.
yes.
90 days your honor. we believe that the 
and if it can deal with a problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-pressing problems under  under foreign convictions if that's what they had in mind.
yes, that's  if we 
but aren't you  aren't you urging a very strange result that the  the decision on the merits of the slusa preclusion issue should be decided by the state courts when the whole purpose of  of that provision was to take matters out of the state courts because there was a view in congress that they were not being handled properly there?
no.
i should say i  i've approached the case on the assumption that the only thing we're worried about is whether  whether the anticipatory part is okay.
it's a necessary implication or it's an implication of the treaty, of section 2 of article 36. but 
now you're reading from the swierkiewicz brief?
yes, i am, your honor. and that's because there's  that is the  just the first step of the missouri procedure. the jury then goes to step two, by which they look at both statutory aggravators and nonstatutory aggravators to decide whether death is warranted. at step three, they then weigh the mitigation against the aggravation. the missouri supreme court itself in the first appeal stated that deck had presented substantial mitigation about his horribly abusive childhood. and it's not accurate that the defense was only related to his  his childhood. in closing arguments, defense counsel repeatedly argued that deck deserved to be in prison because of what he had done, but that he would be safe in prison. there would be no risk that he would hurt anybody else. so that was part of the defense strategy. these restraints were 
there  there is precedent in the courts of appeals, your honor. the cases, i think, are cited in our brief where prosecutions have been invalidated based upon violations of constitutional rights.
yes.
but that's not 
and i would want to suggest 
and it's the language.
i'm a better lawyer than my advisors. (laughter.)
and we can say that is official error and remand it to them. that might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not 
yes.
how does harmless error work to  to pursue justice scalia's line of questioning?
 i was not able to find it, either, in the briefs. it's  the kansas  it's the  it's in the kansas statutes, of course, but i couldn't find it set out verbatim in the  in the briefs. i suspect it's in there someplace, but i couldn't find it when i was looking.
you want us to take the position that there's no legal difference between, (a) entering a home and taking something, and, (b) receiving it on the outside?
 analysis 
 the way our  it's a little odd that the way our cases have  have worked out is that we assume there's two contracts, one for arbitration and the other for the rest of the contracts. that's  that's the way we've rationalized these cases. it seems a little odd to me.
because?
i guess there are a lot of rules in massachusetts that deal with that. they can't  you have to be fair to the defendant in  is that right?
i agree.
do you think we need to use the word practical or practically in section 3?
it 
that's right. there 
sure.
i think that's  that's one of our arguments, that they can't meet the good samaritan law 
well, we're talking 
of course not.
we don't disagree with that and that's precisely what the oregon supreme court did.
it did say, your honor, that there was an obligation for the court to impose it to further comity, finality, and federalism, and that can be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition, "a federal court that sits in collateral review has an obligation to enforce the federal statute of limitations." and, in fact, they quote the advisory committee notes to rule 4, saying the court has the duty to screen out. and they also expressly distinguished their precedent in esslinger versus davis, which relied on granberry versus greer, to say it was a discretionary analysis. they said, "we're not going to consider the discretionary issues raised in esslinger and granberry whether this dismissal would serve an important federal interest. we're just going to say there's an obligation to impose this, and that the district" 
well, importantly, justice scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay. it's a question of whether it logically 
your whole argument for triviality, though, goes  your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because i take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved  if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. so the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. you don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. let me ask you a question that would  that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in california who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?
well, all right. but i mean, they  everybody knew what they were driving at at the time they promulgated this. so it seemed to me that if  if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the reg is outside the statutory authority. and it might be outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too tough a test.
now, what is the 183(b) report?
mr. 
it's not to be mistaken for an intruder and shot at, your honor.
 then that is  that is an  i mean, plain text of the statute, that is a  an allegation that we negligently transmitted the mail. we handled it negligently in how we packaged it. and 
now, what i would 
does that 
well, i mean, i don't want  i don't want to fight the hypothetical, but you have to put a little in context in a case like this because the process here is one that's fairly protracted. you get the first notice and then there's not  there's no actual sale for 2 years. and in this case, the sale didn't take place, so there was  you know, the auction didn't lead to anything, and then there was another  another sale. so we're talking about essentially a 3-year period of time when the person has to be incapacitated, during which presumably  and there have been multiple, six different efforts to try to send notice to her. so it's, you know, one, not a particularly likely hypothetical. i realize i shouldn't fight it. but two, i think at the end of the day, the answer is you can't put the burden on the state to understand the  the precise situation of each of the individual homeowners, that they have some duties because they know, one, they do owe taxes; two, in arkansas they should know that they owe us a duty to keep us up-to-date with respect to their situation, and where  and where it is that we can reach them. and so it's reasonable to impose those duties 
i  i think they're different standards. (e)(1) is a  a standard of proof, and (d)(2) is a standard of assessing a prior court's assessment of the facts.
judge suhrheinrich represented that he was unaware of the deposition, and i have no way to dispute that except to say  i have no way to dispute his own personal representation. but judge moore pointed out in the majority opinion that the deposition was, in fact, before the court and had been presented for  21 months earlier than the initial opinion was entered.
or a contract.
very well, mr. moran. mr. restuccia.
may i ask this historical information? since the decision of the district court and the decision of the court of appeals, has the legislature considered enacting a different statute that would solve the problems?
must  must be very stupid police officers. i mean, it's  it's just obvious what  what you have to do to make a valid arrest. if you say nothing, any  any basis that you could have had for the arrest will  will be used. whereas, if you  if you mention something, you better be able to substantiate that particular cause or a closely related crime. police officers aren't any dumber than the rest of us. i can't believe that  that that wouldn't be the  the consequence of  of the rule you're asking us to adopt.
how can you call, you know, what? is it a separate section of the hard drive? no.
how would that  how would that apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't gotten any permission, who snuck across the border? that's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible, that you are suggesting someone can be detained indefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such treatment could not occur with respect to somebody that had no permission at any time to be here.
all right. now, i would have thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the park.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
are you  are you  the  the argument 
i'm talking about what you think the department of labor was doing when it promulgated 109(a). it was thinking in effect the following: we have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation. but we're not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed  not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power. does that make any sense? that an agency would proceed in that way?
thank you, mr. cruz. mr. schaerr.
right.
no.
 then comes into the office. that is part of their principal activities. the subsequent commute is not compensable, on the ground that it is a break and a commute. that's covered by the fair labor standards act. the portal act is concerned with something else  that is, before the beginning and after the end of your day. the dog cases are, of course, also entirely different from this one. you have  you have arrived at the place of the performance of your principal activity. steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, "on or off the production floor." and so, you're at the plant, and your workday has started. justice scalia, you made the point, and i simply want to reinforce it, that the reference in  to "principal activities" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the reference to "principal activities" in 4(a)(1), but it's also the reference to principal activities in the concluding clause of section 4. if i could just take the court to that. the statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places, but it's also at page 3 of our brief. and so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this concluding clause, and the text frames the workday. and it says that the portal act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply to activities which occur  i'm quoting now  "which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities." and it simply follows, as a matter of the plain text, that when steiner held that those activities, "such principal activities," include the donning and the doffing, that everything that happens between those two events is not encompassed by the portal act.
it wasn't silly for them to, first of all, change the differential that lasted for years, and it wasn't silly for them to increase the price by 70 percent as soon as they made the agreement. there was nothing silly about that. many people suffered because of it.
of those three 
that's not the state's problem. we're talking about the state standing in the way of it. in this case the state through the court system stood in the way of it because it made an error that denied him his right. but the  the  it seems to me the autonomy interest is not merely an interest in choosing second-best. it's an interest in choosing the one you want.
well, but it only 
what about the south carolina supreme court's opinion in the hines case which seems to run counter to your argument?
what about a rescission action in which the private party has conveyed property to the state, and the state doesn't pay, and the private party seeks to rescind the action and to receive back the property that it turned over, which is real estate or a gold bar? could that not 
well, the guardian can certainly bring the claim on behalf of the child. but its' different than bringing the claim in their own right. and i would point that at page 153 of the joint appendix, it specifies at the  at the administrative hearing level, there was no claim for reimbursement to the parents. in fact, what they were seeking was reimbursement to monarch, to the school. in other words, as far as the administrative record disclosed they had not actually paid the funds.
it was never  never tested in the trial court.
why don't you do it on a monthly basis? indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? i mean, the master found that this model really works if you  if you stretch it out over 10 years. you say 1 year. why don't you do it month by month?
no, your honor, i don't think so, since the statute defines "robbery" and "extortion," in 1951(b), specifically to include acts of violence, then all the things we're talking about after the crime would already be part of what's prohibited by the statute.
okay. first of all, this statute does not reach anything that is done overseas. it doesn't reach what the german oem does. it doesn't reach what anybody does overseas. it  it makes liable as an infringer somebody who supplies  who is in the united states who supplies from the united states a component with the intent, with the express intent that that component be combined in a way to create a device that would practice a u.s. patent. now i don't believe  i firmly am confident that if you look at what's at issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions about what is or isn't a component. i might think that a design is a component or it isn't a component, but think of these three features: one, this is something that is totally modular. it is developed, bought and sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to which it is, with which it is combined, and between which it moves continuously as it operates. number two, it can be removed or updated entirely independently of the other components. and it is dynamic, unlike designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to make something, all of which are exhausted. they have done their work when the thing is made. that's why those things are called hardware.
and this was  i wanted to point  was that mostly  in those jurisdictions, was it by court or by rule?
but then he 
i looked at this. there's a time start. and i think it might be the time stamp when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal. but  but something you said at the outset prompts this question, that  did you think that  the time runs from $14 days after the date when the district court's order is entered.
well, i think 
well, justice ginsburg, i think  and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns about using prison  religious symbols or other religious items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the  that there have been cases where the courts, even applying the heightened standard or rluipa or rfra, have deferred to the government officials. i also think, though, it's worth noting how the federal government and the bureau of prisons has dealt with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to beards, would be used for gang identification or gang signification. ohio, i take it, takes the position that if you have a medallion that could be used for those purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all. the bureau of prisons, by contrast, takes the position that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it inside your shirt. so it can't be used for prison signification purposes or gang identification purposes. and i think that shows the kind of reasonable accommodation that rluipa or rfra, as it applies to the federal bureau of prisons 
i'm a manufacturer. i'm reading the statute. i have to give a price on a particular deal. i realize i can't discriminate in price between different purchasers of like grade and quality, where the effect of such discrimination may be one of the prohibited effects. i say, "okay, can i give a different price to one dealer or to another?" yes, i can, because it says "different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality." it is a specific instance of a purchase, a specific instance of discrimination. the very words in the statute are what judges have read consistently to compel that result.
but i think to not accept causation as a requirement, which i think this court has always done  as i said at the outset, this court has said that implementation of the exclusionary rule is premised on the evidence being the product of the police misconduct. to not do that, to not have a causation requirement, i believe, severs this court's current exclusionary-rule doctrines from its moorings. there are many circumstances that this court has, at this point, at least, seen fit to rest with the lower courts, such as the execution of a search warrant. you search within proper scope, you're looking for computer monitors, you find them, but, as you're executing, you open a desk drawer and you shut it, you exceed the scope of the warrant. the law is pretty uniform, currently, that you don't suppress the computer monitors because you exceeded the scope by opening the drawer. if you found drugs in the drawer, you make  you'd exclude those. but you don't exclude the monitors, because there's not a causal connection between the wrong in exceeding the scope of the warrant and the discovery of the monitors. all those cases are up for grabs again if this court severs the causation requirement from the application of the exclusionary rule. and that's just one example; there are others. this court has always required that there be a causal connection, and i believe that it should simply continue to do so. we're not asking this court to overrule any cases, to create any really new principles, we're simply asking this court to understand that sabbath and miller were knock-and-announce for arrest. with an arrest situation, if a person surrenders at the door, you don't go in and search the premises thoroughly. there's a different purpose served in arrest. with a search warrant, knock-and-announce has no purpose of protecting the privacy of the dwelling itself with the discovery of the items named in the warrant, and they shouldn't be suppressed. things that are causally connected can be left to an argument that may be made by counsel in different situations, but, as to the items named in the warrant  contraband, fruit, spirits, instrumentalities  that should not be suppressed. it is simply not causally connected to the entry, and we would ask this court to so hold. thank you.
yes, but as the government points out, that "either before or after" applied to when you had been deported 
 and pushed him.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
what if the  instead of a wire fraud case, it was assault and battery? supposing the canadian revenue agent got inside of new york and one of your clients beat him up, would we have  solely because he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his attempt to smuggle into canada  would we have to say that you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the assault and battery?
well, i'm suggesting in response to your question, justice scalia, that in those other situations where there may be a question, that does not put the petitioner in a situation of not being able to seek review.
is that possible?
but as justice souter pointed out, the state law incorporated the federal standard and made it its own. here you have the federal tax sale and a very strong federal interest, which was lacking in merrell dow. justice stevens said that. but here i think there can be no doubt that the government has a very strong interest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.
no court 
we could call it "quasi-jurisdictional." you wouldn't object to that?
well, your honor, i think that if the state were to say that you  that, "this is definitively rejected, and we're not going to let him amend it," then, in that case, you would have satisfied exhaustion, as far as the  but only if it's definitive. otherwise  well  and i should just go back to the  to the point i was making about a continuing violation. for instance, let's say there is a failure-to-protect claim. someone is in danger, doesn't file. he's in  he's in one of the states where it's 2 days. i think michigan is one of those. he doesn't file within 2 days. the state has  after that, can say, "you can't go to federal court, because you haven't met our deadline." in this case, here, there was a continuing violation that was alleged, and the  and the state basically said, "our rule is, even if it's continuing, you have to file it within 30 days  or 15 days of when it first arose." and, i mean, you can imagine a number of circumstances where this rule here would mean  again, any prison or local jail procedural rule, no matter  is a  presumably, until you get to the point of violating due process, would be a basis for saying that prisoners don't have to go to court. there is nothing in the words of the statute that suggest that, nothing in the legislative history of the statute that suggest it. the only real argument on the other side is that congress must have meant to include it, because that's what "exhaustion" usually means.
what are the  what are the practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may be, of seeking immediate review from the court of appeals by writ of mandate?
there might be, your honor, under those circumstances a compelling interest in doing that. the question would be whether it is narrowly tailored. but 
and where do i look to verify that scientific matter?
yes, your honor, that no one else has  has agreed with thus far.
well, that is the specific issue in this case.
well, if he were foolish enough to make such a claim 
thank you, counsel. mr. stewart.
there are plenty of cases, justice alito, that involve extortion for one's employer where the employer might be a union or a corporation or a charitable body. but it's true the hobbs act has not been applied, in my research anyway i have not seen it applied, to this kind of extortion. but the language clearly covers it and the language of rico clearly covers it.
then  then how do we know it's a core dignity function of the state if they're  the normal rule is somebody else does it?
well, why wouldn't it make sense then for the government to say, chevron, you charge what you want and, station owner, we, the government, gives you  hawaii gives you this money so you'll be able to pay the excess rent?
that's why i'm concerned that perhaps we're being confronted with a request for an advisory opinion. i don't know. maybe they haven't categorically agreed to what  they may be going  willing to say that they aren't going to put anything else in. i don't really know that yet.
but, justice souter, citizens publishing  they did exactly the same thing. they pooled their profits under a  under a formula that was very similar to the formula here.
and you agree that it applies at least where the states are accepting federal money for the prison?
so the burden would be different under different statutes?
but justice scalia, reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals will review the reasons that the district court gave for that disagreement.
why?
it was the understanding of everyone. it's reflected in the record in the first state habeas opinion that the court of criminal appeals acknowledges that the verdict form was sacrosanct. that was not going to be altered, so the nature of the cca's suggested failing of petitioner was that he did not specifically object to the nullification instruction.
no, your honor, under interstate sales tax.
yes, i don't 
i don't believe it does, your honor, because as mr. halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea. of course, certain issues are waived. trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. and as mr. halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases  this court well knows the effect of the federal sentencing guidelines  very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. and now michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.
gee, what about  what about countries that don't have an extensive telephone system, you know, where you  you have to send a runner to notify the consul?
but that  that's true. i now think we're making some progress. i don't think it is quite a qualified immunity. i think it's possible and don't  i'm putting words in your mouth and deny them if i am. one, he's convicted, no case. two, no probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case. three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted. okay?
what happens about  suppose  i just want to follow this. you don't evict the people who are there but it's 22 square miles in the center of new york state. that's a lot of land. and maybe that's worth a trillion dollars, i don't know. so does that mean that the indian tribe would have  would it mean that it had the right to, let's say, hundreds of billions of dollars, the value of that property, that it could sue someone for it, the state of new york or the federal government? i guess the state of new york?
i'm not sure what  what sense it makes. two cases. the woman runs out and  and says, he  he stabbed me and i'm dying, he's a murderer. case one, it's a  a neighbor. case two, it's a police officer and she sees that he's a police officer. why  why should there be a difference? it doesn't make any sense to me.
but that's only one possible message of this button. and again, that's where i'm contrasting the risk versus the reality. it's that it could be any message that's sent.
our position is that the presumption does violate the sixth 
well, it is either directly  it's either yes or no.
well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then i infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?
 decide that here?
and, justice breyer, that sort of first amendment view of your voters shows that the party thinks that they own the voters. we hear this language where the party is contributing voters or they're being poached or it's a donor party. that shows a certain view of the party and what they 
our point, your honor, is that in this situation, doing it this way, the  the motivation predominates over the other legitimate districting criteria, which i think under bush and under 
you're not quite through your answer yet, but is there also a requirement that the competency determination be made within 30 days? or am i  am i in error on that point?
i think, on these legislative materials, they have quite a burden. and let me explain why. your  the  justice breyer, the hypothetical you posit is one with which i can agree. we are not saying  i don't want to be mistaken  that  we are not saying that previous legislation can't have effect on future events, or even future legislation. we're not saying that all. but the nub of our argument is this express-reference requirement, and i think it's  it seems very, very odd to us that when you have a statute that has an  where the express reference appears, and that has a 10-year bar on the authority 
i think the court had the same situation in webster v. doe. that is, in webster v. doe, the court concluded that given the limits on review of the cia director's employment decisions and given the great sensitivity of hiring and firing matters within that agency, the court concluded that there was simply no law to apply in review of the  the claimant's complaint under the administrative procedure act. nevertheless, the court concluded that judicial review of the constitutional challenge remained available. and the idea was not so much that congress itself had manifested an intent to differentiate between the two types of claims. it was that congress had treated the two types of claims the same but that the type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate judicial review of a non-constitutional claim is  it's less demanding than the type that the court would require before eliminating judicial review of a constitutional claim.
yes. i  i mean, i think for this reason. this was essentially an outdoor assembly, where the  whether the students were assembled to watch a particular different, just as in an indoor assembly.
it is likely 
well, you  you might wait a while if you went to the united nations or  (laughter.)
let me look at the language. go back to give me  because in ordinary english, which i hope i speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in ftc law where the word increase means decrease. and if you  is there anything you want  no. it's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.
tell us how we know exactly how much discretion the state of colorado wanted to give to the police.
what i guess we really don't know is whether justice breyer's parade of horribles are cases in which the municipality was able to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it, in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as justice scalia pointed out. i don't know.
so a challenge to the ibla's assertion 
in other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances 
well i'd like to point out that the mandeville farms case that mr. pincus cited does not stand for the same 
 a reliability concern. is that it? is that your point?
thank you, mr. coleman. the case is submitted.
well, because the concurring opinion, 25 which provides the  this precise holding, identified 1 that specific conduct as triggering and could be 2 understood at the time to require that specific conduct to 3 trigger an instruction in these circumstances.
and was it argued at that hearing by the state that stumpf was the triggerman?
prosecutors believed that richards couldn't be avoided by putting the drugs and guns go together into the warrant instead of 
they  well, they  they don't pertain to antitrust. if you look at the history of those provisions they are talking about state causes of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such in them. that's quite different from trinko where there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in detail about saving the antitrust cause of action. the danger of conflict that the sec is talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to 
even though there's some cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't involve any risk to anybody. say the enterprising but careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see official when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses to make his entry.
yes.
do you get the benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your standard? in other words, if you've challenged epa's refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, well, they're following the same approach to a coal powered  coal fueled power plant, and so we get to establish a broader injury? or, aren't you limited to the specific legal challenge you're raising here?
even though the sixth circuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust.
yes.
that's exactly right. in fact, if you look at the closing arguments, mr. hurtz has a couple of references in a two-day closing argument. that was not the centerpiece of his case.
you say there was a legal error. what exactly was the legal error?
thank you, mr. frederick. mr. perry.
but in the trial court, it wasn't, because that's when it would count.
all right. if you say that, they come along and say, okay, you wouldn't have bought the stock. i'll tell you, here's one bad thing happened. you lost your $30. but there were six good things that happened that you never thought of, and so the stocks were four times what it would have been and you'd never have those gains, just as you'd never have the losses. how does that factor?
that's a little different from an adequate and independent state ground argument. you're  you're now making a  a waiver argument.
 evidence was excluded? that would have been a 
i'm not sure it's easy to separate one from the other, mr. chief justice. the way that they are doing that is by arresting him. they have a mandatory arrest law in washington that says that the way that the police must respond to a call like this is to arrest 
it does, because if the employer makes a judgment  as i said before, if the employer makes a judgment that the employee has carried his job duties poorly, incompetently, insubordinately, and so on, that interest is  it's either dispositive of the balance, or it's nearly so. and it  so, from that standpoint, the court could put a gloss on the pickering balance that explains or emphasizes that the employer's interests are controlling how the jobs are performed, prevails. but to get back, for a moment, to the 
but it's something less than the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.
that is an anomaly. the court has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the case except to vacate the order. and i think that's a court that i'm not going to try to explain. (laughter.)
well, when you 
then let me turn, let me turn to our, our merits, your honor. the issue before the court in this case as we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors a meaningful basis for considering the relevant mitigating qualities of these two defendants' mitigating evidence. in mr. brewer's case that included the fact that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major episode of depression about three months before the murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional abuse from his father as a teenager. in mr. cole's case the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of emotional turmoil and problems that continued into adulthood. and in addition to that, the expert who testified at mr. cole's trial indicated that he had been given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal and on some of them very far below normal, under the fifth percentile. and as a result that he probably suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction which limits his impulse control. we respectfully suggest that under this court's decision in penry, those are all the kinds of facts about these two defendants that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an appropriate sentence. but because the jurors were never asked whether the mitigating evidence reduced the defendant's culpability in such a way as to call for a life sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable. the jurors are asked only two questions as the court well knows. but just to review, under the pre-1991 texas statute jurors were only asked two questions: was the crime committed deliberately and is the defendant likely to pose a continuing threat to society? and those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so this court has held repeatedly that whether that two question format satisfies the eighth amendment's individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about the meaning of their instruction. and we believe that in this case, throughout the trial  in both of these cases, excuse me  throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told that they were not entitled in deciding the future dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad inquiry into these defendants' moral culpability. instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear to the jurors during jury selection that in answering the future dangerousness question you must put to one side your opinion about whether the defendant's background, for example, calls for a particular sentence and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put it, the basis of the facts. and we feel that the evidence in this case very strongly would have supported the inference that these, both of these defendants were likely to be dangerous 
let me just ask you to look at the other side of the equation. however we assess the burden, we're assessing it in relation to the state's interest. what is your best statement of the state's interest here that you think is defensible?
do you know why?
it's quite possible no one in congress thought about this 
yes, but isn't it  i guess my 10 problem is isn't  isn't it a sense  isn't your 11 argument for a sense of diligence which is really other 12 wordly? at the moment the defendant's conviction based 13 upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to 14 expect that any defendant would have an incentive to 15 attack that conviction. and  and the result, it seems 16 to me, of  of your position, your preferred position, is 17 if  if diligence is measured from that moment, that no 18 defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will 19 ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent.
so, what's 
and our problem with that, justice breyer, is that all eight district court decisions here thought that they were deciding subject-matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for removal. and 
his testimony was taken in this case and can be taken in this case because at that point in these proceedings  and you have to look at the evidence of record to this point in this proceeding  there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a motive for this prosecution.
i think that that's a question, your honor, that this court has struggled with. as justice scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in dominguez benitez, that we're talking about with these harmless error standards ineffable gradations of probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to grasp. but i think if we just tie it to the facts of this case, i think that in the explanation you just gave that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this case and conclude 
well, actually, your honor, the statute does say that the ruling would have to be made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. it does not say a case. and a decision of a district court would make that retroactivity applicable only to one case not to cases.
oh, yes, we did, your honor.
but it's not the united states that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled. it would be the country abroad. and i  i think the argument was, what the united states does other nations will copy.
 might not have pled guilty if there was a different set of rules. i thought that was what drove the court's opinion.
yes. after abela v. martin in the sixth circuit. and there is a  a whole host of federal district court decisions in the eastern and western district of michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the aedpa standard of review applies. and so the state obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. they obtain deference on habeas corpus review. they prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on state collateral review. and so the state very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. it's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. in fact, the state 
yes, but you've got a jury 
are those  have they been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or have they always been brought in by defendants?
mr. marcus, assuming we accept your view about the way the statute should be read, i take it you agree that because of the curtilage official possibility under florida law, that florida law, that burglary in florida is not a generic burglary?
correct. i'm  i'm drawing  effectively what  the point i'm making is that this distinction between the federal question case joined with cases that are not within the original jurisdiction and the diversity case, which is clearly within the original jurisdiction, because all parties are diverse, but it is joined with claims that are below the jurisdictional amount, so that they are not within the diversity jurisdiction.
but if we did  if we did enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there would be no u.s. law that would be violated. you're talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes of another. but, at least in the restatement of foreign relations now, that's put in terms of  there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgments of another; but neither is there any prohibition.
you may, indeed, mr. smiland. mr. minear, i think you're up next.
the language could be construed to allow that, but  but waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, and the language i think is more properly construed, as justice breyer has suggested, to allow joinder as a necessary party. and in fact, it was enacted in specific reaction to that problem in the barcellos & wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing litigation and there was a sense by the irrigation district they needed to join the united states so they would not be subject to inconsistent suits. so although i think that the language can bear the  the interpretation that you're suggesting, justice scalia, nevertheless, i think the better interpretation is the more narrow one that is 
i don't 
that's right, your honor, absolutely.
i don't think, i don't think he just omitted them. i think he was not raising that claim.
it does? all right. that's an issue, i guess. i'd have to decide: is a compelling and  does it require the government to go further? but you concede that if it doesn't require the government to go further, you lose.
what happens in a title vii case if, in fact, we meet just what justice ginsburg said? can you have a jury trial? imagine a situation, jury. okay?
well, it's much harder on the union in that respect but not in the respect that's critical here, and that is the federal law as well as the laws of all the other states who have, have required separate segregated funds limit that requirement to candidate elections. the, the reason this statute is unconstitutional, the reason it does not consist of a compelling, does not provide a compelling governmental interest in regulating elections, is because it goes far beyond the permissible realm of regulating expenditures on candidate elections, and prohibits the union without affirmative authorization from spending its funds for ballot propositions.
mr. lamken, you have about 4 minutes left.
and i mean, i think your answer to justice breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement. but in  would you agree that in this case, if we  if we do proceed, number one, to agree with you that brecht is the standard, and we then do proceed to apply brecht here or to determine whether brecht was properly applied here, that in this particular case, the, the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error. even applying brecht clear. and you know what i'm getting at. i mean, five weeks of deliberation. the question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. obviously this  this case was just to tottering on the edge. so even if we, if we do get to the point of applying brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that he's  he gets no relief under brecht?
they filed a reply brief. there are a lot of disputes about the facts. do you concede that the lincoln property company that you sued is a texas corporation?
well, the  i don't think the question  we cited rule 9(b) in our brief because fraud must be pled with particularity and  and that  and that rule applies to all the, quote, circumstances constituting a fraud. but the court doesn't need to address the question because even under rule 8, the plaintiff must allege all the elements of the cause of action.
right. he misapplied, he didn't adopt this theory, the theory that an nsps official modification precedes at all; in fact, he contradicted it. he misapplied in quite sort of anomalous circumstances the increased hours 
no. i'm just looking 
before the act occurs.
the question is not  i can illustrate it with this case. the question is not do you want more efficient pedals. if that's the test, then everything is obvious because we always want more efficient pedals, justice, and i'll come back to this. it's always going to be the case that if your test is capability, every patent including the first three claims of this one is going to be obvious, because you're always capable of assembling a pedal. what it says, what the federal circuit says, is there a motivation to make this invention? was there motivation, and this was the heart of the federal circuit's ruling in this case, their theory is that asano renders our patent obvious. and the federal circuit said all right, what's the motivation to take asano and take the electronic throttle control and make it responsive 
 had been made?
if the court were examining the  the first prong, your honor, i think those factors might be relevant. here, though, the test is set out in not only the idaho case but also the alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by congress. and idaho applies that. idaho looked very carefully for some action by congress ratifying the reservation in that case. here, we need an action by congress. the united states has identified what they contend is the action of congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the alaska statehood act. that proviso, though, just does not cover these lands.
thank you, mr. kise. ms. bonner, you have four minutes remaining.
to go on, there are three decisions of this court that control the result here, evans, ricks and lorance, each of which says that the employee cannot circumvent the limitations period by challenging conduct within the limitations period on the grounds that it is the result of a prior act of intentional discrimination that was not timely challenged. a second reason to reject petitioner's rule is that petitioner's rule, as petitioner admits, creates a special rule for pay cases when there is nothing in the language of title vii that would justify a special rule. title vii has the same mandate of nondiscrimination for pay as for any other practice. it has the same 180-day period for pay claims as any other claim. and the third reason to reject petitioner's view is that it would undo the statute of limitations in pay cases, because the result would be, what you have here is that an employee could wait until the end of their career, or at least a very substantial number of years, and then challenge current pay on the basis of past acts that took place a long time ago. and justice breyer, you talked about it being limited to just back pay during the two-year period. the courts that have looked at this have not decided whether it's the 180-day period or the two-year period if you buy petitioner's theory, i don't think he has either. but the important additional point of order is you're still hinging liability on past acts long ago and you're adding the possibility of compensatory relief and punitive damages, so it's not the limited damage award that you're contemplating necessarily.
payments  the right to payments for medical care, which we believe is the language of limitation in that the state is  in effect, is seeking an assignment of the entire cause of action not just that that is related to the right to payment for medical care, which is simply a component of the claim that may have 5 cents on the dollar value or 100 cents, depending on what the facts of the case are.
certainly, the state could stop it, yes. the question 
no, your honor, because horizontal  the important thing to keep in mind is that the incentive of the manufacturer when the manufacturer 
to what extent? and i asked the  the racist  the religion that says god wanted the races to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell me with someone of another race.
 yes  about whether an offset would be subject to the time limit.
that's correct, justice scalia.
yes, your honor. it certainly is there for that purpose. but the rule doesn't mandate that the court  that the case proceed by that route. what i'm saying is that once the 50(a) motion is made and denied, the stage is set for an appeal pursuant to section 2106. the rule 50(b) route is merely there to allow a litigant, who does not believe that the issue has been fully heard, briefed, considered by the court, to raise the issue again, but not to put us in the position where, in the normal course, the judge follows the usual procedure of submitting the case to the jury, because the jury may resolve the problem by deciding the case in favor of the party that should win on the evidence, but then, at that point, the judge merely has to enter  has to enter judgment in order to trigger the 50(b) motion. that doesn't seem to be a good way to proceed, and i don't believe that's what's contemplated by the rule. and, in fact, it is a common practice among 
but i can be confident that if there are any procedural hurdles to this court's exercise of jurisdiction in any of the state cases, mr. casey will alert this court of them. and there may well be. for example, in the melody harris case, the michigan supreme court remanded for further  remanded for her to then file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of counsel. was the michigan supreme court's order a final order? i don't know. this court would obviously have to resolve that. but i can be confident that mr. casey will certainly bring up any procedural hurdles. and of course, this court cannot exercise jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it would be more convenient to do so. this court does have jurisdiction in this case. the petitioners never challenged prudential standing at any point in this litigation  they  they challenged only article iii standing, injury in fact  until this court. and so part of the reason we don't have a better record is because this came on a motion to dismiss. this court recognized in lujan that a motion to dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a  a different procedural posture. it requires the assumption of facts being true.
doesn't it?
well, i disagree, your honor. for example, other countries that have domestic policies have found ways to accommodate that have not violated the treaty. for example, switzerland provides needles and heroin to its  to its drug users. and the united states has not objected that this is a violation of the treaty.
in connection with what's included and what isn't included, the  in that same 3731 provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so excludes (h). and if congress had meant that with respect to the 6-year period, they could have said the same thing, that it relates to (a) and (b) and not (h).
may i go back and just nail down one lose end in  in an answer that you  you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? i assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no irs reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your ira terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.
 can be 
 that if the prison explained what their practices were, in terms of the needs of security, that a lower court will then say, "well, never mind that. the supreme court just said it. we don't have to enforce it"? i don't think there would be that kind of lawlessness.
so it gets back to how important you think and how  whether it's true or not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far as all these screens go.
what 
that  that's right, your honor. this form was  was preprinted or pretyped.
now, on  on your theory of  of behavior modification, would it, nonetheless, be  be open to the state to say, no, you may not receive any more legal materials and you may not go to the library to look at them? because that's something you very much want to do. and in order to do that, you've got to shape up and  and get moved down to a lesser level of security. would that  i'm not saying that the state is  is about to do that, but on your theory, could the state do that?
sure.
no 
well, a judge can consider those aggravating factors.
thank you, ms. gartner.
well, earlier this year in the nixon case, this court said that when we look at any  and that was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. did it mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity? the court said any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting, and the court said when using it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the court did. now, you're right, justice o'connor. this court has said that the purpose of the felon in possession statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the government reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases, scarborough, bass, and lewis, and all three of those cases in which the court referred to congress' comments and this court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute were 1202(a) cases. and so notwithstanding the fact that the court said this is a broad statute, each one of those cases, lewis, bass, and scarborough, were cases where by definition the prohibition was against persons convicted in any court of the united states or a state. so that language doesn't help the government at all because those were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the court to any court of the united states. so to take the  and i  and  the simplistic view that as the  as the fourth and sixth circuit did and as the government does here, that any means any, without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply  is  is too narrow a focus. let's look at the statute. it's true that the word  the term, the two words, any court, is not defined. but if we look in the definitions section, the term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined. and so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase, convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year. and that definition says the term, crime punishable by more than a year, excludes any state or federal antitrust or business regulatory offense. now, if we exclude from the definition of crime punishable by more than a year and the government's  if we exclude from that any state or federal antitrust law and the government's interpretation is adopted, then we're left with the anomalous result that if a person is convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're allowed to possess a firearm. if they're convicted of one in france or england, they can't.
thank you, mr. minear. mr. franklin, you have about 3 and a half minutes.
i don't think so. i mean that might be a situation  i don't know that that's a realistic hypothetical, i mean, let me just say that. if that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that might be an example of where this question i talked about with justice stevens might matter. which is in that case it might matter whether or not the intent was measured 
right.
mr. chan, there is really no way for the state entirely to protect itself by  even by filing an answer immediately. that would protect it against the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it wouldn't protect it against the district judge's ability to grant an amendment after the response.
that's the way that we submit official it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those facts.
justice ginsburg, clearly the ten commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the state of texas.
where it would come from would be it would be an alternative way of getting to, say, justice souter's test, and it couldn't  i agree with you  depend upon whether these are within the realm of people who are relying. but suppose you had a fraud where nobody had relied. you see, it was really a failed fraud, and you can get that under federal law.
well, are you dealing with active inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or is that a satisfactory way to resolve this case?
 he's no longer on parole? than the entire balance changes. the reduction of the expectation of privacy 
well, of course 
to this claim?
well, it does, justice o'connor, but just to take a step back, i mean, applying that same standard in the smith case, you yourself thought that a general law banning marijuana use outside or  or peyote use outside 
and judges should be cautious, your honor.
and what would they have found?
but under 
well, then if you 
well, first of all, your honor, i'm not defending that michigan has a more restrictive scheme or that michigan law in any way incapacitates or significantly interferes with the business of banking.
is there any evidence at all that the amount of reading that they do has any correlation to their opportunity for getting better assignments?
yes, your honor. exactly. he had limited options and i believe it was a no-win scenario. and he took the best course that he reasonably believed he could at the time. and 
thank you, counsel. mr. doss, you have 5 minutes remaining.
so habeas could be brought here?
justice ginsburg, i think there can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation where the government can agree with a party to proceed  as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the basis of classified information, but that would involve a very different way of  of proceeding than the normal default rules. and i think absent some kind of agreement for the government to proceed in that way, the default rule in civil litigation has always been that the privilege is just that. it's  the matter is  the matter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.
no. the case is i think not distinguishable from removals under the federal officer removal statute, where congress has indicated that it is the federal defense that confers jurisdiction rather than the federal claim. then, the official ultimate merits of the federal defense are irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue. and the court 
offhand  i believe it's within the last couple years.
should we clarify that? because i don't  i didn't read the case saying what justice scalia just said or what you  what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial  in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.
what do you think, if we did go to thompson and looked at that, this would be a fortiori from thompson, as described in osterneck, was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, your  your  the new trial motion is timely, though it wasn't; it was out of by two days. while here, we have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered with a  you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you have till the 27th to file.
nor could charities. they were immune as well. but it  it certainly wasn't sovereign immunity.
there are arguments here, there are arguments there, but it  it does not dawn upon me that  that anything is clear about this at all.
 seems to me that's what's going on here.
well, that's what struck me as odd there. footnote 27 says that's a basis for staying the injunction. it seems to me if it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis not to issue one in the first place.
do you have any authority for that other than justice scalia's speculation about how this  (laughter.)
i think, actually under the second circuit's standard, that 
but i 
well, i think what 
no. i'm drawing your attention to paragraphs 61 and 64 of the affidavit.
but we don't have any colloquy. we don't know what happened at the  you're saying it's  it's altogether likely that that happened, but we don't know.
because the  the hearings below, when it was sent back down by the florida supreme court, were only on the issue of whether or not there was consent to  to the  what the florida supreme court deemed to be the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. there was not a hearing on the balance of the issues, and it was strictly limited to that.
that's correct, your honor. from the courts, he can get a damage remedy but i don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. the damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. also, as i was saying to justice o'connor, it can't be 
why should there be no futility exception?
yes, but it  it's not at all clear in the opinion that the court was using preclinical and clinical in the very technical sense that you were  that you use it, which means "clinical" is stuff submitted for the drug application, and "preclinical" is for the earlier application. that is not at all 
but if arkansas was a party to the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?
that is correct.
excuse me.
well, the  well, the icj has held that you can't rely  that these procedural default rules are not adequate to vindicate the treaty interests.
so when 
but it's more than six months, i assume.
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
well, as a 
if you went back to the  if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws, they would say that where you use a legal term that has a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't need to spell out the definition of that, of that concept. it's enough to use the term. so what the ninth circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go back to something that's more demanding than would have been required in a nineteenth century indictment and frame that as a violation of the fifth amendment.
but in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to miller-tydings and mcguire. that's what makes this  this one different in terms of congressional intention.
the government said you don't want unnecessary discovery. you have to put out pleadings that make clear what your theory is 
i never did like it. (laughter.)
that's right, your honor. and the problem with this solomon amendment is that the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine says that you can't put a private speaker to that crisis of conscience.
yes, it was, and you know, the chinese 
i don't  i don't recall.
oh, justice 
i mean, does it make any difference as a matter of what they have to do in order to comply with the law that they are now exempt from michigan rules and subject to federal rules instead?
as far as 
because the state court lets you file it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim by claim.
yes.
excuse me?
suppose we disagree with that.
well, let's assume  let's assume that the cavity search is demanded at the bus station, and the officer says, "we know that drugs get transported by people who ingest them in the balloons, and they get on buses and they travel back and forth from city a to city b." any reason that that would run afoul of arbitrary and capricious?
 than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever.
 i thought there  the houses were divided. one party, one  had one house; the other, the other. and so they were at loggerheads and they 
if that were really the case. in a case like this, it would be clearly pretextual, because not only  not only was that not the basis that was actually offered, but the employer sided with him initially and released the defendant and said he had a legitimate basis for speaking, and called a meeting with the sheriff's department, and took all these steps to show that they actually sided with him. and only when the sheriff's department accused him of  as acting like a public defender and said, "we're going to get sued if you don't back us up," then the office changed its position and went against ceballos. so, in a case like this, it would clearly be pretextual. in another case, however, it would not  presumably there are cases where it would not be pretextual.
well, this case is almost identical to givhan. the only  the only thing is that the court, in givhan, didn't expressly opine on what capacity in which she was speaking. but it clear that 
yes, but then there was also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene of the crime.
well, but it's content in the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively authorized.
i want to go back to the federal statutes and the state statute.
under the  it is not the law in the sense of fundamental fairness. it is certainly an indication of what 
well, is, though, a treaty that's been duly ratified and signed enforceable as part of our federal law, as this one is drafted?
yeah, yeah. but there  you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel. why do you need a judge wheel in new york if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge? and why did you get different sentences across the country which i don't  i've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like. that's a different issue. so what  what i'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the constitution of the united states prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges  god doesn't tell us what the right sentence is. we don't know. there are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. and you're saying we have to go back to that. and that wasn't  i'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either. and that's what i'm looking for, to be honest with you, and i haven't  i'm not certain i get it.
if you had a diagram of the official person's house and you had burglary tools in your car and you had maybe even called to make sure the business was closed and you were driving there and as you're driving there you're telling the person sitting beside you: i'm going to break into that, you know, business at 254 main street. that would be enough under florida law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a structure.
and i assume, although we haven't so decided, that that can just be waived.
pardon?
yes, but 
well, if the allegation is also made that the defendant was negligent, then i think it clearly satisfies the pleading standard under form 9. i think it would be a more detailed complaint than the sample that comprises form 9 of the rules.
what instruction? i haven't seen one. i haven't seen 
they also draw on the assistance of local law enforcement. and this is also 
 assistance 
but i want you to address the question of how the legal category of "reasonable expectation of privacy" fits in with what i just said, where i'm assuming, in some social situations, you do think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly including, situations of danger where the police might be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you will be left alone. i want to know how those facts, if they are facts  and you can say they were not  fit within the category called "reasonable expectation of privacy."
and, again, i think mr. moran correctly points out, in  many of these cases are resolved by finding that the richards v. wisconsin exceptions have been met. it is not, to me, remarkable that there are not a lot of civil actions. i believe there are not a lot of violations, because, while no-knock entries may occur, they are justified, under richards v. wisconsin, in most cases. this case is an aberration.
 get things straightened away right away.
in this case 
i think that  i guess we don't have a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would be sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206 through 208. but as for 201(b), once  the fcc does certainly gets deference, has gotten deference for a hundred years for its determination of what is an unjust and unreasonable practice.
in the absence of the anti-lien statute, the state statute would be, in my opinion  the state would be allowed to take a greater lien than provided by federal law. but  and a lien statute is there, and we say that that is the stopping point. the federal anti-lien statute gives protection to the recipient's property as to which these assignment statutes are an implied exception, but the exception must be limited by the 
well, we think that  we realize that our position was inconsistent with not only the court's decision in cipollone and in medtronic that recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties. but more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the same facts could come up with completely different reasons why a label is false 
 a search warrant?
well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the state to collect money from people against their will?
the court of appeals has to inquire on its own, right?
1346 in my view would not apply to that situation, in that if property was seized and used to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the government proceeded to sell, then the third party, petitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop the foreclosure sale under 7426.
well, is this going to lead to difficult problems in determining what falls within the job duties of a particular employee?
if that's your answer, can i go back to the other main issue for a second? i would have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my mind, is the classic case where there should be jurisdiction because the ag is supposed to say look, i don't think anything happened, okay? so he was doing his job all day. but if something did happen, i'll tell you what, it was within the scope of his employment. and apparently, that's just what they did say here. and then it got mixed up in the courts below. in other words, if he made some phone calls and even if he mentioned the employee, even if he said something improper, it was within the scope of his employment, official which is just what they said. so because of that, it seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of nothing. now you explain what your answer is.
 they ignore it if they  if they think that we didn't know what we were doing.
right. your 
well, we think that the  that the oregon supreme court decision was correct in  on the  on the eighth amendment. and we think it's  but it's  not necessarily for the reasons stated by the oregon supreme court. and the fact is that if the oregon supreme court held that we have a right to  we believe that we have a right to respond to any evidence they offer on aggravation.
i don't believe so. in civil-rights actions, there are  the constitutional rights at issue are the injury. so one  if a person started out with saying their injury in the civil-rights action was the admission of the evidence 
if the eeoc decision is upheld by one of the courts of appeals and there is an attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the government confess error?
in other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?
which is just the facts of this case. and i suppose that if the plaintiff prevails on the common law cause of action for ejectment, he's got a  a res judicata defense if the  if the present occupier then makes another suit based on the tax deed.
as i recall groh, that case specifically turned on the fact that the face of the fourth amendment requires that the warrant describe, not that the supporting documents describe, the place to be searched and the items to be seized. and i think in this case we already know it's okay to look behind convictions because taylor itself says so. the only question is what items are acceptable, and 
okay, maybe it doesn't matter.
that minors were involved?
thank you.
 is the claim 
the issue of immunity of powerex was never raised in this case. it can review the question of whether it is an organ of the state it but it cannot review the remand determination that powerex can never be granted the procedures benefits of federal foreign order bench trial. thanks, your honor. the court: thank you, counsel. mr. simon.
your customers are pretty sophisticated people, i guess, they're specialists in an unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably know this market pretty well.
i don't believe the booker decision rejected that, your honor. what i believe the booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way to some extent. at least at the very beginning. once the district courts apply the 3553(a) factors, and go through the statute, and consider the guidelines, the district courts will then explain their rationale; and then that rationale will be  in our opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the guidelines are.
but there's no way they can change the ship structurally when it's in new york and not have it changed structurally when it's in europe. so the mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of ships that i would not say fit the ordinary word cruise. what they are are ships that go between asia and san francisco, los angeles, or new york and europe, or maybe through the suez canal. they're only here a little bit of the time. their passengers are mostly not american. now, is that something i should worry about? if that were your case, i would be very worried. if that's just a little bit of  of added significance, then i want to know what to do about it.
the problem with your case  maybe it's our problem because it was our rule  is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board calculus as to the rule. in some cases, as i think you will have to concede, under the roberts jurisprudence, the fact finding was more accurate. in your case, what you are telling us is that the fact finding is far less accurate. but i think you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we depart with it. with a rule-made jurisprudence, we have to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not just your case. it seems to me that was the problem you had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest some way out. i don't see it.
of course, that might be likely if there had been a history of these claims being successful, but none has ever prevailed. so i doubt if that would be very  very good to figure you can, you know, save your  your key argument that has no precedent of winning.
but a videotape of a crime scene again would be  would be not testimonial.
well, exactly. and  and in chandris, this court rejected the snapshot approach to determining what's a vessel and the first circuit seemed to go back to that. and certainly what the first circuit did seems in serious tension with this court's cases. it just didn't follow the same line that we had outlined.
"or activities."
you're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.
well 
in the absence of the anti-lien statute.
i don't know why the or would necessarily follow. i mean, if you prevail, there's nothing that compels the state to put money in what has been suggested, a training program, shelters, counselors for these people.
as i indicated, your honor, at the time there was no authoritative pronouncement. if even 
or 10 to 20 years, if 
all right. let me 
no. it is not our position that that would be a valid transfer if there was a violation of the nonintercourse act. the principal issue here is whether, after of the passage of 190 years, there remains a possessory right. if there was a violation of a nonintercourse act in 1805 and 1807, justice kennedy, we believe the oneida indian nation has a  under this court's decision in oneida ii  a federal common law damage suit against new york state or against the united states of america for failing to exercise its fiduciary duty. but after 190 years, in 1997, they did not have a possessory right to these properties. the possessory right we're talking about, aboriginal title or some other tribal possessory right, isn't just a concept. as this court has defined aboriginal title of those possessory rights, it's a right to current possession. and under this court's decisions in cases such as felix versus patrick and yankton sioux, and williams and mitchell and santa fe, all of which were cited in the dissent written by justice stevens, for the, for members of dissent in oneida ii, tribal possessory rights are barred by that passage of time, the change in the character of the land and the innumerable innocent purchasers.
the copies, the physical manifestation on a hard drive 
no, this express 
i  i stated an or. i  what i  i stated at the outset?
yes, your honor, or leave it to the states and let the states do it. but we don't want the federal government to be intruding into the operations  into the culture of these small businesses, and that i believe is the difference between the immunity that you mentioned, the qualified or prosecutorial type immunity, which depends upon actions, and this immunity here which depends upon simply the status of the defendant, the whole class 
well, they would first have to get into court first. they would first 
they're going to say it because they make a finding that through a whole variety of various devices, all of which were listed, that j. howard, who wanted to give her money through something called the catchall trust was prevented in about 15 ways. and even if you're right that there's a texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped in, well, how do we know? maybe it was a valid grat trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate j. howard from contact with her, j. howard would have figured out what had happened before he died and he would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. do what i want. revoke it. but all that is just hypothetical. i'm just using that to show you why i think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the elements of the crime are  or the elements of the tort are.
i think that scenario would be closer to neder, but i think that's a different scenario than what we have here. and i think the reason why it's different here is because the jury returned  under washington law, returned a complete verdict. there is no  there was no error in either the verdict or in the jury instructions as a 
and if i could talk to various aspects of that, i'm happy 
then which way do you think that cuts? there's 
i'm not  i'm not sure how it is in other situations. all i'm saying is when you have these two oil companies who are directing this and pretending that the decisions are being independent, that is not the fact in this case. and there's nothing wrong, justice souter, for two of these to read the way they did because they did it in our case.
and 
and all that, assuming the financing is the same as here, everything else the same, is it implicit in your argument that they're all equally unlawful?
well, i was just trying to articulate it, which is to say that this court has talked about the capacity for noninfringing uses. i think, with a mature product like this, it's fair to point to how it's actually used in the marketplace.
yes, but i also 
the state concedes, and as the california supreme court recognized, the prosecutor misstated the law, but the jury would not 
then there's an affidavit about probable cause. that's true. so 
in  in  yes, but you're doing it in connection with a  a joint recruitment activity. in other words, the  the agencies that you hire to get the workers up to the door are not going to succeed very well if  if all the workers are going to arrive without any papers and without any  any indication like a social security card and so on that they can be part of  of the legal work force. so there's  there's something extra being done both by the  the recruiters and by you, and the extra, in effect, is a  a scheme to provide phony id's that suggest that these people are  are lawful rather than  than unlawful immigrants.
what percent?
oh, i could  i could 
i  i don't  i don't have any information. there's no information on  in the record about exercising it in other cases, and i just  i just don't know. but the first part of the question, there could  as mr. waxman mentioned, there  there were other visual cues noted on the cards. attorneys, especially 
 going to say, "well, here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption in my case," just as, if it looks like he's waited a long time, he's going to say, "well, here's why that delay was reasonable." i don't know that the presumption you're proposing serves much of a purpose.
our argument is that it would be applicable only if the injury that we claimed in our federal suit was an injury caused by the state court  the court itself or the judge rather than our adversary and we sought relief from that judgment. that would obtain the nature of appellate jurisdiction rather than we say, well, sabic did us wrong, we'd like a judgment. and then sabic can come in and say, well, they're precluded. they already tried that.
the question is what motivated the prosecutor. correct?
taking each of the questions that you asked, justice breyer, first, citizens publishing was section 1 and 2 and subsequently 
 nonviolent assaults.
let  let me ask you the same question that i asked mr. goldstein. even in the cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have liquor in the u.s. port, but when they leave and they go to jamaica, they could pick up rum there. they could have liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they enter and leave the u.s. port, they didn't have the liquor aboard. here what you're saying is what goes in the  for the new york port goes for every other place where this ship puts in.
but when  when somebody is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it can get. it gets registered officially. this person is suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it, she's out.
well, why wouldn't it be worth  i know here. but why wouldn't it be worth the effort, instead of getting $90 on the note, to get 95?
yes.
so he's been represented by counsel throughout.
and that's not permitted in oklahoma, is it? that kind of behavior is not permitted in oklahoma.
that's right. okay. and  and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect equipoise, who loses?
but i thought that was just the answer you gave to justice stevens on your point two.
correct me if i'm wrong 
availability of a cause of action. here 
 the royalty agreement says, you know, "we have a dispute about the validity of this patent. we don't know. we disagree. and so, we've entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the uncertainty." but once it's determined to be invalid, the license fees are not collectible.
your honor, i  i  we would ask that this court not do that for two reasons, that the alternative theory of tortious interference was never pled. it was never argued, and the district court dismissed this complaint with prejudice because there was no alternative theory. they did not move for leave to amend. so i think this court should say one of two things about the alternative theory. either, number one, it is waived, or number two, based on the arguments that have been advanced and the allegations of the complaint, it could not possibly be cognizable. and i  i don't think you have to be an expert on interference law in order to reach that conclusion because 
which may not be jurisdictional, the weekend rule.
why wouldn't we just vacate it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate the judgment and send it back?
is there a 
well, how is that different from saying the entry is lawful, its only problem is, it was done without a warrant? i mean, you know, he's 
 that it  [laughter.]
yes, i think it would also include disabling yourself from looking at it. and so, i think it's an important part of your case, that you didn't adopt this new system of decentralizing the file so that it's in the computers, out there, solely in order to get around napster.
 it is removable and within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts so long as the defendant has presented, either on the complaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defense of preclusion. only 
counsel, your  your position is not that anything that she says or anything anyone says in a 911 call is  is consistent with the confrontation clause.
so the mere fact that it doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that congress reserved it, does it?
they claim that that's by toleration of the fcc. i was going to ask them about that, don't worry. [laughter.]
we're arguing, first, the ninth circuit is wrong and that california's rule is consistent with batson. now, as to whether other rules may apply, batson has a footnote stating that it was not going to attempt to instruct courts on how to apply its process. that might leave room for other states to come up with alternate systems of proof. what is important here is that california's system is consistent, and as respondent, we are not seeking to require all states to do something. rather, as the respondent, it is sufficient that california's process is acceptable just as california's process was acceptable in smith v. robbins for handling cases in which there are no nonfrivolous appeals on issues. a variety of standards perhaps could be tolerated.
one of them. that's true. and there was a gentleman 
we would argue that race cannot be used for its own sake, that if you're going to put people together into a latino majority district, it should be to meet a purpose, for example, to create an opportunity district under the voting rights act.
so, now, as a result of the fourth circuit's decision, do the parents always go first 
in our view, no. if it's a job  if the public employee's assigned job duties is to, on behalf of the government or the employer, speak to the public about certain things that are going on in the office, and he happens to get disciplined for it, that wouldn't pass our step.
but the cost of that deal would  they'd also run the risk the democrats would  would migrate also if they made that deal.
i think, your honor 
you know, if you compare, for example, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6. you know, if  if one looks at, for example, the plan 1385 submitted by gi forum, that has one plan, district  one district, district 28, with a higher perimeter-to-area score of  of 10.0. and indeed, the district court found as a factual matter that the demonstration plan submitted by the gi forum appellants was  was less compact and critically would not perform. going back to the section 2 question about district 23, the district court found that one district in the demonstration plan, district 28, had only a bare majority of citizen voting population, 50.3 percent, and there was undisputed testimony that for a district to perform in this region, it had to have 
justice ginsburg, section 7426 was not available in the case of mrs. williams, but 
 for a violation of that federal standard.
well, it talks about air pollution all the time. that's what the, that's what the thing is about, air pollution. it's not about global warming and it's not about the troposphere.
yes.
yes, but you can't  the  presumably the federal government can't negotiate away the endangered species act or something. the fact is that new laws were passed after these contracts were entered into with westlands. isn't that right?
 directs the jurors to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime. and so, counsel was dovetailing his very effective argument with the  with the instruction itself. and what's significant here is that, like in payton, like in boyde, this case involved virtually all of belmontes' penalty-phase evidence. and the entire main thrust of his argument to the jury was that he could not make it on the outside, but he could fit in the system and contribute to society in the future, if given a chance on the inside. and again, as was true in boyde and payton 
here is what it adds, justice souter. "undermine" and "subvert" have a connotation of completely preventing the performance of the official duty in the proceeding. "impede" removes any implication that you need to totally thwart the government activity in order to be guilty of this crime. it's enough to "interfere" with it, which is the word that the court of appeals used to define it.
it could be appropriate. the treaty was prepared  drafted full knowing that there are various and myriad kinds of legal systems throughout the world, and it wasn't intended to say, here's the  here's the remedy because typically under international law, the remedy is  is a domestic remedy. and this  this doesn't  the treaty does not say, thou shalt suppress.
i gather only 20 percent of it is water.
but you're saying 
well, they 
absolutely it would.
your position is, this would apply to the universe of administrative proceedings. now, this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an express statute of limitations. so, what we're talking about, for the future  what would change under your interpretation? not gas leases, because  there's a 7-year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and 
 to its brief, at the bottom of the page, subsection (b) 
and the question is whether he can cover this as well.
the 
but congress didn't  to be fair, congress did not enact rico because it was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate commerce. the whole point is that they had something significantly different in mind, and your allegations in the complaint seem to be fully met by application of criminal conspiracy law.
well, he 
the patentee could be paying his royalties. the patentee could also be putting ads in the paper saying, "this is not a valid patent." it could  it could have acquired a lot of publicity. and, in the end, there could be reasons, and there have been such cases  which we cited, 47 of, our brief  where such suits have been brought. but 
first, you have to look and see if there is a 
it goes somewhat beyond the smallest trickle? doesn't it? doesn't it also include ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they obtain a trickle during a rainstorm?
no. i beg your pardon, your honor. no, we did not address eligibility in the present case.
your honor, i think that's certainly why buckley applied exacting scrutiny. but i think what vermont understood is that political spending has inescapably a dual character. yes, campaign spending enables many forms of speech, but it also has another side because higher and higher levels of campaign spending result in candidates who are beholden to the constituencies that can provide the greatest amounts of funds for their campaigns. and what you end up with, the consequence, is legislators who say, you know, i've lost the drug money and i can't afford to lose the food manufacturer money 
you're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in a, because you don't think the language requires that methodology. and it is the same language in b.
your honor, my response to that is it is not that important, and when i say that, it is not that important because it would not even have defeated summary judgment. the 
i think that legislators would be surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they were affecting their criminal law. in fact, many of those statutes have individualized determinations, the military being one of them. 17-year-olds can enlist. there is an individualized determination, albeit by parents, not the government. 17-year-olds may be serving in iraq today. that  the other kinds of examples that you cite, for example, tobacco 
i think that's correct, your honor, but 
but, now, maybe i'm 
i believe that the habeas relief should not lie. now, i have seen circuit courts treat it different ways. some courts will decline to give deference and review it de novo, but i don't think congress intended, in enacting aedpa, the a-e-d-p-a, that a state habeas  a state conviction should be overturned simply because of an accident in a statement or formulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise constitutionally balanced 
i agree with your honor that there's not a merit selection system in 
you  do you think such a provision would be enforceable?
i mean, you know, i realize you want to save the conviction and the penalty, but if you look at the mine run of cases, it's pretty hard for me to see how the state could show special circumstances and they not get a finding from the judge that they're right.
well 
it can't prevent it a hundred percent, but no 
i think the answer is there  if england  if the england decision were extended to the williamson county context, there would not be claim preclusion. we think it shouldn't be extended, and therefore if they litigated both their state claim and their federal claim in state court, we think they would be barred both by issue and claim preclusion.
that's right. that is  and westlands has the  has the option of either engaging in contracts with the individual farmers or distributing the water through regulation, and it has opted for regulations. now, westlands itself is a governmental unit. it is comprised of the  of the very farmers here, among others, who have brought this suit. and it has the authority to act in a representative capacity on behalf of all its members. and that is why the united states enters into contracts with irrigation districts precisely because it allows them to reach accord and agreement and to resolve their disputes. now, the fact is that the united states and westlands agree on a great many things. sometimes they disagree, but when we disagree, we're able to  to speak to one another as two governments representing constituencies and hammer out our differences. and that would be impossible if these types of third party beneficiary suits were allowed. and i think that goes to the crux of what the united states' real concern here is. when there are contracts between one government and another, just as in the context of treaties or compacts among the states, it's vital that the two governmental units be able to deal with one another as governments and to be assured that if they can reach accord on behalf of their representatives  on behalf of the parties they represent, that that will resolve the issue. if it were otherwise, this type of distribution of water 
well, you know, your honor, it's not really the content of the advice. the question is at this point what would people do, and the legal error here, what's wrong, is that the foreign national is given the same three options, but by law, he's supposed to have a fourth option.
so it states  would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?
well, justice stevens 
but let me  let me raise this question. if, in this case, he gets past step one because of the mexican bar association speech, and if, as you suggested in answer to a question a little while ago, that anybody could go public and get at least past step one of pickering, what is to be gained by the extremely  well, strike the "extremely"  what is to be gained by the restrictive view that you take that if he doesn't go to the bar association, or doesn't go public, there's no protection at all? in other words, it seems to me that the public is being protected in a way subject to an immediate end run.
but i thought you argued the rogers standard was a correct standard in the missouri court?
 what happens when you simply don't file within the prescribed period.
well, what do you think is the standard for determining what sort of causal connection there has to be in order to have suppression here?
right. that would be  right. you would have to find that the  you would have to find an error and one that was objectively  and then the california supreme court objectively unreasonable in not finding the error. this is true. so obviously the reasonable likelihood test is a  is a relevant inquiry, but it is not the inquiry. and i think that  that that's what payton's argument demonstrates and the ninth circuit's analysis demonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a decision that the california supreme court's conclusion was incorrect with their personal  in their subjective opinion with a  with the standard that the decision must be objectively unreasonable. and in this case, the california supreme court's decision was manifesting not objectively unreasonable. we know  we  we know that objectively unreasonable doesn't have a clear definition. we do have an example of what is objectively unreasonable, and that was cited in payton's brief and that is a failure to consider particular facts or relevant law. and we know that that didn't occur in this case. the very argument and facts that payton insists were not considered by the california supreme court in applying boyde  if not in the majority opinion  are found within justice kennard's dissent. so we have no question that the california supreme court identified the correct case and the correct principles within the case and considered all the necessary facts. and that should make this decision subject to deference under aedpa. this court last term provided additional guidance on how to assess the range of reasonable judgment through the lens of aedpa in yarborough v. alvarado. and one of the things that the ninth circuit and payton's analysis keeps overlooking is the  boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k). and when you analyze the  the range of reasonable judgment of the california supreme court concerning factor (k), the specific rule of factor (k), the  the range of reasonable judgment was less. the california supreme court had little to no leeway to conclude otherwise. boyde's holding is broad. boyde held that factor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction that allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a sentence less than death and specifically found that background and character fell within the ambit of factor (k). and no decision of this court or the california supreme court in analyzing character has ever drawn a distinction between post-crime and pre-crime character evidence 
 appeals said.
one concern is that, in the prison situation, the prison is exerting control over all aspects of the prisoner's daily life. that's very different from just court access, as in tennessee versus lane, and it could require very extensive requirements, perhaps. is that a concern, or should it be, in the "congruence and proportionality" examination?
i believe it does not have to if being a forum would disrupt the school's own educational program and 
that  that's correct, your honor.
we think it's fair to assume, as the court would under the establishment clause, that they're familiar with the act of congress that makes it its message as well as a program. a critical point on this attribution argument is that it's not supported by any single piece of evidence that respondents, themselves, have put into the record in this case. their first amendment objection is to the content of the ads. there's not a single piece of evidence in the record purporting to make this attribution argument that the public would attribute to the ads to them. it's not in the complaint in this case, it's not in their own affidavits, it's not in the 
actually it was not. according to these student affidavits, they were simply released and said, you can go watch 
i don't think that's permissible, your honor. it  it is  granted, for purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for states to order judges to withhold rulings, that there shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence prior to the return of a jury verdict. louisiana, for example, does that, and i think oklahoma. but for the supreme judicial  judicial court of massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is simply straight contravening what this court has said. it's  it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.
by a means which you decline to specify, so that if they come up with some other means, you could  you could object to that as well i assume.
is that their burden or is your burden to show 
well 
i want you to read the entire brief 
i don't, i don't think there is, justice breyer, and it's very short.
yes.
no, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?
did you ask how it's preserved? we raised the 
a judge's reaction to a case is often affected by just exactly what's involved. and here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim any particular prejudice out of the error in this particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's no defect in the indictment at all because it was adequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged with. this is much like a case in the state systems where you have notice pleading. it doesn't seem very prejudicial. but you put it in a different context, you might have a different reaction to the case.
that is not part of the  the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.
but your answer just isn't responsive. when has it become final?
right.
well, i think it ostensibly could be. i think what we know, though, looking back at what  at the  at the raleigh trial and at  at the  at the trials even in the colonial period, was that the founders were concerned about abuses by the state, in  in particular, in interrogations and in eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial testimony.
well, that's possible, but 12 you also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under 13 subsection (4).
in so many words, your honor, in connection with the mitigation phase, in  in connection with the factual basis hearing even, he put on the evidence saying, you know, mr. stumpf says he wasn't the shooter and gives a lot of reasons to discount that evidence. so he's arguing that in fact mr. stumpf was the shooter. i think it's a fair implication if he doesn't say the express words, but it's a fair implication. of course, at that time, there was absolutely no evidence to the contrary. mr. wesley had not yet been extradited from texas. he hadn't even made this alleged statement to mr. eastman.
did he not know that these classmates were there at a public event that was sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had directed the students to go?
the  the most close reading of the text would be that any civil action under 3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of the united states  now, we differ from the ninth circuit on this. we believe that is only a government official, in particular a department of justice official  knows of the facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the united states could bring, i.e., the cause of action under 3730(a). but we think that 3 years from that date in the action under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam action or including a retaliation action. but that reading is not essential to the position that we advocate here.
i think the assumption, your honor, should be that the number of cases is going to be the same either way. it's just a question of when are they filed and, moreover 
do you think the final, the judgment in the criminal case is still pending because it can be acted upon?
 or no discrimination, you've got a speech issue that you're going to address.
wasn't there any interest in determining whether the complaints have merit? i mean, i think you must be interested in getting rid of 11,000 complaints and reducing them down to 200. i would think that's more important than saving the court some time. there must be, you must have some interest in determining whether the complaints have merit.
 disagreeable it is to you 
but the  as the court held in carnegie-mellon, a remand of pendent claims after the federal issue has been resolved is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of 1447(c). rather, it is a discretionary remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and so 
well, how do you explain then, ms. dahl, the language in the court's zadvydas opinion that had, were we dealing with, in effect, off-shore aliens, this would be a much different case?
 with respect to social security setoffs, of course, it would.
well, sure you'd agree with that, if it's his duty to call it or  just as it's the duty of a  of a lawyer not to lie to the court. if there was a similarly clear legal duty for him to say something, you'd say that was part of his job description, right?
 absolutely correct, justice 
because it's purely elective and not medically necessary.
total, your honor. the total figure, nationwide, is 146.5 million. if you divide that number by the 6.7 children in special ed 
justice souter, i have two points in response. first of all, what i think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in kentucky except for mccreary county and pulaski county because of their prior conduct. the second point that i think is important in this context is that i think this court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the first amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the voting rights act.
 that that's actually a right.
right.
 end quote, still can be regulated, quote, "whatever its nature," so long as, quote, "it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce." now, that's the language, and i take it that justice scalia is exactly right, i thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.
section 1956(i) is the venue provision.
the plaintiff gets up and establishes the four points. defense. the defense rests. now, does the judge send it to the jury, or does the judge direct a verdict for the plaintiff?
if it were  clear that a jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase  assume that's a possible finding. if that were true, would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?
we submit it is a not a "so what," justice breyer. because section 201(b) is broad, but it's not all-encompassing. and congress plenty of times in section 276, and in lots of other sections of the communications act, has responded to modern necessity by giving the fcc expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as i said here, in section 276. but our core position here is that when congress official expands the fcc's authority, and it doesn't create a concomitant federal right of action along with it, it is telling the fcc to handle these things administratively, use its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them accordingly.
please don't. (laughter.)
no. i imagine there are some human beings in equilon called marketers, and those human beings in equilon who work for equilon would say equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas stations at such-and-such prices. that's normally how a company works. is there something different about this?
and of course, in the efabco case 
now, suppose i think that the ag does have the power to stop congress from gutting the act. all right? now, on that, do i have  if i believe that, on that assumption, do i have to decide this case against you?
thank you, mr. dreeben. mr. donovan, you have five minutes remaining.
and some don't. and the  and the state systems vary.
excuse me. could you expand on the first point a little bit? i mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits. is  is that  is that all that it amounts to?
these lay witnesses 
 motor carrier, not to the owner.
i think it would be easy for us to make a distinction between the right and the remedy.
no. in  in our view, in harmonizing the  the principle that judicial review 
or a 911 operator who was an agent of  of the police.
how do i know that this is a regulatory taking, in other words?
the procedure. yes, it is. new policy 111-07 is what the district court reviewed and then what was further reviewed by the circuit court.
capital murder includes, in this case, that the homicide involved more than one person in a single act.
if we're talking about a clerical error, your honor, the massachusetts rules and the federal rules provide for correction of clerical errors. what  what we're talking about here is not a clerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do what she did.
and what were the facts of the aiding escape? was he trying to get away or was he helping somebody?
haven't we  haven't we got something equally different here? the  the issue here, as i understand it, is  is not litigation of the state law claim, but a claim under federal law with respect to the passage of title when property is taken for taxes. as i understand the  the original plaintiff's claim, it simply is that if he's right, under federal law he is entitled to a declaration that the property is still his. if he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property. but the issue is a federal issue, and the only way the state has a role in it is that the state provides a mechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to 1983, for getting it into a state court. so it seems to me that the issue is a federal issue, not as in merrell dow, a  a state cause of action that incorporates by reference a federal standard.
this is a specially dangerous area in which to allow litigation.
well, it seems to 
 even  even with halliburton.
doesn't it? i mean, it  it says that  what's  what's the exact language of that statute? i just had it here. it's  it's gravity. it's the 
you really think that  that they cut it that fine? they say, oh, yes, this guy is going to go into bankruptcy. we're pretty sure about that, but don't worry. we'll have priority.
all right. then at best alaska is a neutral. because we didn't think it, we're operating as a mistake. it's a neutral. okay. now, what's bothering me about the case is just what justice scalia said, that  that why i  if i sell you all my clothing and then i put, but not my camping gear, i mean, i can absolutely see you don't get my camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer? i mean, it has nothing to do with mess kits.
of course, he's a 17-year-old without any learning in the law. he probably didn't realize there's any requirement that these things have to appear in the transcript. i mean, that's understandable.
but it would have been spent differently, your honor, and i think that's the critical 
well, your honor 
yes, but, i mean, what  it was made in what house? was it made by the conference committee?
well, because  but this is the sort of regulation  the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact  i believe the court should be in the position of trusting the state of california to be able to administer its regime. there is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens  the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this court suggested in lopez 
yes. it says news reports in that provision of the statute.
well, you know, i looked at your  the  the references in your brief for that proposition, and i did not see them borne out. you referred to a  a footnote in the district court opinion which, in turn, refers to the remark of a sponsor of the amendment that  that resulted in the presumption being in the law. and the only thing that was attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption should be regarded as rebuttable. the  the footnote in the statement did not indicate that the presumption was a disappearing presumption, once the other side went forward with any evidence. so i don't see, based on your  your citations, that the presumption goes away simply by  by one party going forward with evidence.
i don't think that's 
yes.
are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?
no?
correct.
it isn't as though they enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset social security and, in that statute, said, "and  but, by the way, there's a 10-year period of limitations here."
but one 
that's correct.
but isn't it quite independent of the anatomical approach that the health exception is denied? i mean that's an  that does not depend on the anatomical approach. the anatomical approach may well be an answer at the facial official challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example. but the health excepton problem is not affected by that. and the difficulty that i have with your argument that somehow the health exception issue should be left to an as applied challenge is the statement in stenberg, and it's on 938. i'm quoting: "but where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health, casey requires the statute to include a health exception where the procedure is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation "  excuse me  "of the life or health of the mother." now, your position, it seems to me, requires us to do one of three things. either we, we overrule stenberg in that respect, or we, we find  i don't know how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the stenberg statement. or three, we say well, there seems to be a tension between the showing of substantial medical authority which occurred in the litigation in these cases and the findings made by congress, and under those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore the record in the cases and go with congress's official apparently contrary judgment. which of the three do we take?
there were questions earlier about the status of the particular plaintiff. you're not challenging standing or raising mootness, are you?
if it's just engaging in banking activities?
does the fifth amendment takings clause apply to a government tax scheme that taxes something beyond the income received?
how about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the sixth circuit do it? that's my question.
well if i could just 
as i understand it 
the circumstances in other states, which we've been able to identify, include a range of  of circumstances, which include  as is available in california under the penal code section, which requires the delivery of a presentence report, together with a commitment order, is analysis on a particularized circumstance basis of the individuals who are coming into the prison and making a  an estimate as to what may occur. other states use a random assignment circumstance, and giving no consideration whatever to race. and a third group of states apparently consider race as part of an overall or holistic bit of analysis with regard to trying to equalize the prison populations.
no. they saw that from the driveway, through the  the slit  slit  slats in the fence.
and i would submit to your honor it clearly does not because this case, involving blue cross suing denise finn for these benefits involves not issues of the construction or interpretation of a federal statute, but issue  the issues involved in our case are whether they're entitled to collect the money that they paid three times to the same doctor for the same service on the same day. they paid a particular dr. brown $17,500 for the same service on three occasions. in addition, our dispute involves whether or not some of the benefits that they claim they paid and which were medically a result of this accident were in fact or whether they were taking other benefits they paid and trying to be a little cute and collect those under saxony. those are the issues. those issues 
are you saying, are you arguing that there, during this period, there is an application for state relief pending in the state courts or that there is an application for state relief pending in this court?
she wasn't standing by a grease rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door because the door had basically been obliterated on a very cold, rainy february morning where she was very cold, and after  and had been taken through the  the pouring rain in bare feet and with only a t-shirt and was left there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a coat or shoes. and she was made to sit by there and she was very cold and uncomfortable. and she did complain that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that they were uncomfortable and could they be removed. it's not a garage in  in the way that the vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's  and the  the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of this. you could see that the  the occupants were made to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was unnecessary. and that  that was clearly established law in the ninth circuit certainly under franklin that the manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly established law in the ninth circuit as of 1994. i think in the heitschmidt case, which is very similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994 search. you had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-suspect as to whom the  the officers didn't have that  that kind of  of suspicion. and the fifth circuit found that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to the officers. so from our standpoint, on the issue of being detained past the time, i think it's just a clear case. i think the other side has conceded that if  if there's this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment has to be affirmed on that basis. on  on the handcuffing issue, we believe the same principle has to apply because the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when you view those facts, i  it  it is  no reasonable officer would believe you could do those things to ms. mena in these circumstances based on the law at the time. and i think that it would be  what the  what the united states and  and what petitioners' counsel is asking for is really for a radical change of law themselves. we're happy with summers and graham and the way that applies, and the  the jury instruction was based on  on summers and graham and on franklin. the language is taken directly from those cases. and  and the  the jury in a case like this  qualified immunity obviously provides some protection for  for officers that when  when a reasonable officer wouldn't know these things. but jury verdicts also play a crucial role in a civil rights case. in this case, a jury of our community found that iris mena had been subjected to an abuse of  a specific abuse of authority in being held beyond the time of  of the search, even at a time when the prime target was  was free to go about his business with a citation, and was held in these painful handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was treated much more harshly than anything this court, i think, contemplated in the summers case. and i think that officers know how to  officers know how to handle the fourth amendment issues involved in this case. they don't need a special rule because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious intrusion on their individual liberty. and so we would urge the court not to go down this new path that the united states and the petitioners are asking and to affirm the judgment because it was based on clearly established principles that this court and other courts around the country have  have established. thank you very much.
but could it?
that's a different question. i'm just focusing on, did it have authority to deal with this issue?
i'm making a mistake here. i thought that the reason they bring in the almanza standard is, as i put it before, a kind of act of charity. that is, since there was no contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't get any appeal normally. but we'll let you do it if you can show egregious harm. i'm wrong about that?
well, i  i guess my  my point  maybe it's some of my colleagues' point  is that really the strength of the government's case is subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not this would cause a delay of  of time, whether it would get into extraneous issues, et cetera.
the case that i'm reading from is the concurring opinion in carlisle against united states. it does cite thompson.
your honor, no, he would not formally interact with the commission, just as the pecos river master does not formally interact with the pecos river commission.
and you're saying so long as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great wealth in the state of california, it is okay.
german alliance, your honor.
yes.
you'd have to have another factor in the decision, which was that you didn't want to change pay. but cost alone couldn't justify that.
absolutely, justice stevens. and i think 
i don't know what the added element is.
right.
justice scalia, i don't believe it's a technical difference. this court has always drawn a sharp distinction between a court's ability to grab back a case from another court after that case has passed beyond its authority to  as opposed to reconsidering it before ever relinquishing jurisdiction over a case.
may  may i ask you? i'm unclear on  on lesser-included in mississippi. and i'm going to take this step by step.
in the prison setting, does he wear such restraints? justice scalia suggested the jury might say, wow, that's the way he has to go around the rest of his life with the  all chained up. but in  do we know whether in the prison he would be routinely wearing these restraints?
and i think that there's ample basis for the court to do that  that is, one of the noteworthy features of the csra is that the act authorizes judicial review of a wide category of government actions in different courts under different circumstances. but there's no provision of the csra that ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access to a federal district court. that is 
not  they are subject to heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out of-staters in a way that you could not  for example, in new energy, you said that you can't have a preference for  you can't have a discrimination in ohio in reciprocity for indiana. reciprocity laws normally do violate the principle of dormant commerce clause invalidation.
you said mr. nixon was  was the client. was he in the courtroom?
beyond that, if the plaintiff's negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the  there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there would have been no negligence by the defendant.
 constitutional 
but why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely? a district court doesn't have to leave the pleader to its own devices. it can have a pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will. but in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.
well, but 
thank you, counsel. the case is submitted.
